table of contents overview businesses loral is a leading satellite communications company organized into two operating segments satellite manufacturing and satellite services 
satellite manufacturing our subsidiary  space systems loral  inc ss l  designs and manufactures satellites  space systems and space system components for commercial and government customers whose applications include fixed satellite services fss  direct to home dth broadcasting  mobile satellite services mss  broadband data distribution  wireless telephony  digital radio  digital mobile broadcasting  military communications  weather monitoring and air traffic management 
satellite manufacturers have high fixed costs relating primarily to labor and overhead 
based on its current cost structure  we estimate that ss l covers its fixed costs  including depreciation and amortization  with an average of five to six satellite awards a year depending on the size  power  pricing and complexity of the satellite 
cash flow in the satellite manufacturing business tends to be uneven 
it takes two to three years to complete a satellite project and numerous assumptions are built into the estimated costs 
ss l s cash receipts are tied to the achievement of contract milestones that depend in part on the ability of its subcontractors to deliver on time 
in addition  the timing of satellite awards is difficult to predict  contributing to the unevenness of revenue and making it more challenging to align the workforce to the workflow 
while its requirement for ongoing capital investment to maintain its current capacity is relatively low  ss l estimates that facilities expansion to enable the booking of  on average  seven to nine satellite awards per year will require incremental capital expenditures of up to million over the next three years and has initiated planning efforts to accomplish this 
the satellite manufacturing industry is a knowledge intensive business  the success of which relies heavily on its technological heritage and the skills of its workforce 
the breadth and depth of talent and experience resident in ss l s workforce of approximately  personnel  is one of our key competitive resources 
satellites are extraordinarily complex devices designed to operate in the very hostile environment of space 
this complexity may lead to unanticipated costs during the design  manufacture and testing of a satellite 
ss l establishes provisions for costs based on historical experience and program complexity to cover anticipated costs 
as most of ss l s contracts are fixed price  cost increases in excess of the provisions reduce profitability and may result in losses to ss l  which may be material 
the highly competitive satellite manufacturing industry has recently recovered from a several year period in the early part of this decade when order levels reached an unprecedented low level 
buyers  as a result  have had the advantage over suppliers in negotiating prices  terms and conditions resulting in reduced margins and increased assumptions of risk by ss l 
ss l was further handicapped while it was in chapter  because of buyers reluctance to purchase satellites from a company in bankruptcy 
satellite services our subsidiary  loral skynet corporation loral skynet  operates a global fixed satellite services business 
loral skynet leases transponder capacity to commercial and governmental customers for video distribution and broadcasting  high speed data distribution  internet access and communications  as well as provides managed network services to customers using a hybrid satellite and ground based system 
loral skynet has four in orbit satellites and has one satellite under construction at ss l 
it also provides professional services to other satellite operators such as fleet operating services 
while we compete with fiber optic cable and other terrestrial delivery systems  primarily for point to point applications  loral skynet has been able to combine the inherent advantages of each technology to provide its customers with complete end to end services 
since fss satellites remain in a fixed point above the earth s equator and can provide service to wide geographic regions  they provide inherent advantages over terrestrial systems for certain applications  such as broadcast or point to multipoint transmission of video and broadband data 
a satellite offers instant infrastructure 
it can cover large geographic areas  sometimes entire hemispheres  and can not only provide services to populated areas  but also can better serve areas with inadequate terrestrial infrastructures  low density populations or difficult geographic terrain 

table of contents the satellite services business is capital intensive and the build out of a satellite fleet requires substantial time and investment 
once these investments are made  however  the costs to maintain and operate the fleet are relatively low 
the upfront investments are earned back through the leasing of transponders to customers over the life of the satellite 
given the harsh and unpredictable environment in which the satellites operate  another major cost factor is in orbit insurance 
annual receipts from this business are fairly predictable because they are derived from an established base of long term customer contracts and high contract renewal rates 
competition in the satellite services market has historically been intense in recent years due to a number of factors  including transponder over capacity in certain geographic regions and increased competition from fiber 
this competition puts pressure on prices  depending on market conditions in various geographic regions and frequency bands 
a stronger economy and an increase in capital available for expanded consumer and enterprise level services have more recently led to an improvement in demand in certain markets 
much of loral skynet s currently unleased capacity  however  is over geographic regions where the market is characterized by excess capacity  coupled with weak demand  or where regulatory obstacles are such that we find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage as compared to local operators 
during  loral skynet initiated steps to restructure its network services global operations  which is a component of the satellite services segment 
the plan called for termination of certain operating leases and involuntary termination of certain employees and was completed in as of december   we incurred million of costs associated with this plan  of which million was for employee termination costs and the remainder related to the write off of inventory and fixed assets 
we do not expect to incur any additional costs associated with this plan 
on december   a joint venture formed by loral and its canadian partner  the public sector pension investment board psp entered into a definitive agreement with bce inc to acquire percent of the stock of telesat canada and certain other assets from bce inc for cad billion approximately billion based on exchange rate of cad 
in connection with the telesat transaction  loral will be responsible for funding certain cash requirements as well as  contributing substantially all of loral skynet s assets to telesat canada s business in return for a economic interest in the ultimate parent company of new telesat  which will hold both telesat canada and the loral skynet assets 
see item business recent developments and the telesat canada transaction below 
on march   we consummated the sale of our north american satellites and related assets to certain affiliates of intelsat  ltd 
and intelsat bermuda  ltd 
collectively  intelsat 
this transaction precluded loral skynet from providing lease capacity into north america for two years 
bankruptcy reorganization during the years  the sustained and unprecedented decline in demand for our satellites and the transponder over capacity in our satellite services business exacerbated old loral s already strained financial condition brought on primarily by the investments we had previously made in globalstar  lp globalstar that we subsequently wrote off 
globalstar filed voluntary bankruptcy petitions under chapter in february on july   old loral and certain of its subsidiaries the debtor subsidiaries and collectively with old loral  the debtors filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter during the ensuing two and a half year period we further increased our emphasis on cash conservation by reducing operating expenses and closely monitoring capital expenditures 
on august   the bankruptcy court entered its confirmation order confirming the plan of reorganization 
on september   the federal communications commission the fcc approved the transfer of fcc licenses from old loral to new loral  which represented satisfaction of the last material condition precedent to emergence 
the debtors emerged from their reorganization proceeding under chapter on november  pursuant to the plan of reorganization 
pursuant to sop we adopted fresh start accounting as of october  see notes and to the financial statements 

table of contents future outlook we have reorganized around ss l s satellite manufacturing operations and loral skynet s fleet of satellites 
following our emergence from chapter  we have focused primarily on taking advantage of the years of experience and superior expertise of our professional senior management team to capture opportunities in our markets and maintain an efficient stream lined operation 
construction of telstar n  a powerful new multi region ku band communications satellite for loral skynet  has begun at ss l and upon completion will be launched into the wl orbital location 
scheduled to enter service in late  telstar n will provide commercial and governmental customers with broadband connectivity within and among the american  european and african regions 
our customers will also use telstar n for video distribution and high speed data and voice services 
this satellite will be transferred to new telesat as part of the skynet transaction as defined below 
upon closing of the telesat acquisition and the skynet transaction  loral will hold a economic interest in the world s fourth largest satellite operator with more than billion of backlog 
the integration of loral skynet s and telesat canada s operations and the combined satellite fleet of this new telesat canada and loral skynet company  comprised of in orbit and four satellites under construction  will offer customers expanded satellite and terrestrial coverage and continue to offer superior customer service 
we believe that this transaction will allow new telesat to compete more effectively in the fss industry 
see satellite services operations in part  item for more information 
critical success factors for both of our segments include maintaining our reputation for reliability  quality and superior customer service 
these factors are vital to securing new customers and retaining current ones 
at the same time  we must continue to contain costs and maximize efficiencies 
loral skynet is focused on planning the integration of loral skynet s and telesat canada s operations and identifying opportunities for cost reductions while managing loral skynet s on going operations 
ss l is focused on increasing bookings and backlog  while maintaining the cost efficiencies and process improvements realized over the past several years 
in addition  ss l must continue to align its direct workforce with the level of awards 
in order to complete construction of all the satellites in backlog and to accommodate long term growth  ss l will need  and is in the process of hiring additional staff 
long term growth at ss l will also require expanded facilities  and working capital requirements  primarily for the orbital component of the satellite contract which is payable to ss l over the life of the satellite 
we regularly explore and evaluate possible strategic transactions and alliances 
we also periodically engage in discussions with satellite service providers  satellite manufacturers and others regarding such matters  which may include joint ventures and strategic relationships as well as business combinations or the acquisition or disposition of assets 
in order to pursue certain of these opportunities  we would require additional funds 
there can be no assurance that we will enter into any strategic transactions or alliances and  if so  on what terms or that we will be able to obtain such financing or favorable terms  if at all 
on february   loral completed a million preferred stock financing pursuant to the securities purchase agreement entered into with mhr fund management llc mhr on october  loral plans to use the proceeds from this financing  together with its existing resources  to pursue both internal and external growth opportunities in the satellite communications industry and strategic transactions or alliances  including completion of the telesat acquisition see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
see part  item of this annual report on form k  for a complete description of loral s businesses 
consolidated operating results please refer to critical accounting matters set forth below in this section 
the following discussion of revenues and adjusted ebitda reflects the results of our operating business segments for  and the balance of the discussion relates to our consolidated results  unless otherwise noted 
as previously discussed  we emerged from chapter on november  and adopted fresh start accounting as of october  as a result of the adoption of fresh start accounting  the successor registrant s financial statements are not comparable with the predecessor registrant s financial statements 

table of contents references to full year financial information throughout this discussion combine the periods of january  to october  with october  to december  management believes that presenting the financial information in this way is the most relevant and useful method for making comparisons 
the common definition of ebitda is earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
in evaluating financial performance  we use revenues and operating income loss before depreciation and amortization including amortization of stock based compensation and reorganization expenses due to bankruptcy adjusted ebitda as the measure of a segment s profit or loss 
adjusted ebitda is equivalent to the common definition of ebitda before reorganization expenses due to bankruptcy  gain on discharge of pre petition obligations and fresh start adjustments  gain loss on investments  other income expense  equity in net income losses of affiliates  and minority interest  net of tax 
adjusted ebitda allows us and investors to compare our operating results with that of competitors exclusive of depreciation and amortization  interest and investment income  interest expense  reorganization expenses due to bankruptcy  other income expense  net losses of affiliates and minority interest 
financial results of competitors in our industry have significant variations that can result from timing of capital expenditures  the amount of intangible assets recorded  the differences in assets lives  the timing and amount of investments  the effects of other income expense  which are typically for non recurring transactions not related to the on going business  and effects of investments not directly managed 
the use of adjusted ebitda allows us and investors to compare operating results exclusive of these items 
competitors in our industry have significantly different capital structures 
the use of adjusted ebitda maintains comparability of performance by excluding interest expense 
in addition  during chapter  we recognized interest expense only on the actual interest payments we made 
during this period  we did not make any further interest payments on our debt obligations after march   the date we repaid our secured bank debt 
reorganization expenses due to bankruptcy were only incurred during the period we were in chapter these expenses have been excluded from adjusted ebitda to maintain comparability with our results during periods in which we were not in chapter and with the results of competitors using similar measures 
we believe the use of adjusted ebitda along with us gaap financial measures enhances the understanding of our operating results and is useful to us and investors in comparing performance with competitors  estimating enterprise value and making investment decisions 
adjusted ebitda as used here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by competitors 
we also use adjusted ebitda to evaluate operating performance of our segments  to allocate resources and capital to such segments  to measure performance for incentive compensation programs and to evaluate future growth opportunities 
adjusted ebitda should be used in conjunction with us gaap financial measures and is not presented as an alternative to cash flow from operations as a measure of our liquidity or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance 
the sale of our north american satellites and related assets to intelsat in march has been accounted for as a discontinued operation  resulting in our historical statements of operations and statements of cash flows reflecting such discontinued operations separately from continuing operations see note to the financial statements

table of contents satellite manufacturing ebitda excludes charges of million for  as a result of the settlement of all orbital receivables on satellites sold to intelsat 
this settlement had the effect of reducing future orbital receipts by million  including million relating to a satellite under construction in consistent with our internal reporting for satellite manufacturing  this decrease in contract value for the satellite under construction was not reflected as a decrease in satellite manufacturing revenues 
these charges had no effect on our consolidated results in satellite services revenue and ebitda include million resulting from receipt of a customer termination payment for the year ended december  for the year ended december   satellite services recognized million of ebitda for a sales type lease arrangement for satellite capacity and an impairment charge of million relating to our telstar estrela do sul satellite and related assets to reduce the carrying values to the expected proceeds from insurance

table of contents income tax provision benefit during  and  we continued to maintain the valuation allowance that had been established at december  against our net deferred tax assets 
however  upon emergence from bankruptcy in  we reversed our valuation allowance relating to million of deferred tax assets for amt credit carryforwards 
as of december   we had valuation allowances totaling million  which included a balance of million relating to old loral periods preceding our adoption of fresh start accounting on october  we will continue to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
if  in the future  we were to determine that we will be able to realize all or a portion of the benefit from our deferred tax assets  any reduction to the valuation allowance existing as of october  will first reduce goodwill  then other intangible assets with any excess treated as an increase to paid in capital 
during  we utilized the benefits from million of deferred tax assets from old loral to reduce our current cash tax liability 
the realization of this benefit created an excess valuation allowance of million that was reversed as a reduction to goodwill 
also during  we recorded a deferred tax provision of million in accumulated other comprehensive income  which created an excess valuation allowance of million that was reversed as a reduction to goodwill 
to the extent this adjustment related to unrealized gains on available for sale securities  which for the amount was million  when such securities are ultimately disposed in a future period  we may be required to increase our income tax provision in the statement of operations in such future period by a portion of such adjustment 
our income tax provision and benefit can be summarized as follows i for  we recorded a current tax provision of million and a deferred tax provision of million  resulting in a total provision of million on pre tax income of million  ii for  we recorded a current tax provision of million and a deferred tax benefit of million  resulting in a net benefit of million on pre tax income of billion  which included a gain on discharge of pre petition obligations and fresh start adjustments of billion  and iii for  we recorded a current tax provision of million and a deferred tax provision of million  resulting in a total provision of million on a pre tax loss of million

for  in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy  old loral realized cancellation of debt income cod on its federal income tax return of approximately million 
cod realized while in bankruptcy is excluded from federal taxable income 
we were required to reduce certain of our tax attributes  and to the extent sufficient attributes were not available on a separate company basis  reduce the tax basis in our assets  by an amount equal to the cod excluded by old loral from its taxable income 
this adjustment resulted in a reduction of approximately million to our deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowance 
also  as part of our fresh start accounting and plan of reorganization adjustments  we recognized a net income tax benefit of million  which includes a net deferred tax benefit of million 
see notes and to the financial statements 
for  the deferred income tax provision of million related to an additional valuation allowance which was required when we reversed the following deferred tax liabilities from accumulated other comprehensive loss i with the dissolution of globalstar on june   we wrote off the remaining book value of our investment in globalstar s million credit facility and reduced to zero the unrealized gains and related deferred tax liabilities previously reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss

table of contents backlog backlog as of december  and  was as follows in millions satellite manufacturing satellite services total backlog before eliminations satellite manufacturing eliminations satellite services eliminations total backlog critical accounting matters the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for the period 
actual results could differ from estimates 
fresh start accounting in connection with our emergence from chapter  we adopted fresh start accounting as of october   which required all of our assets and liabilities to be stated at estimated fair value 
we engaged an independent appraisal firm to assist in determining such fair values see note to the financial statements 
significant judgment was exercised by management in estimating the fair values 
revenue recognition most of our satellite manufacturing revenue is associated with long term fixed price contracts 
revenue and profit from satellite sales under these long term contracts are recognized using the cost to cost percentage of completion method  which requires significant estimates 
we use this method because reasonably dependable estimates can be made based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates include forecasts of costs and schedules  estimating contract revenue related to contract performance including estimated amounts for penalties  performance incentives and orbital incentives that will be received as the satellite performs on orbit and the potential for component obsolescence in connection with long term procurements 
these estimates are assessed continually during the term of the contract and revisions are reflected when the conditions become known 
provisions for losses on contracts are recorded when estimates determine that a loss will be incurred on a contract at completion 
under firm fixed price contracts  work performed and products shipped are paid for at a fixed price without adjustment for actual costs incurred in connection with the contract  accordingly  favorable changes in estimates in a period will result in additional revenue and profit  and unfavorable changes in estimates will result in a reduction of revenue and profit or the recording of a loss that will be borne solely by us 
depreciation depreciation is provided for on the straight line method for satellites over the estimated useful life of the satellite  which is determined by engineering analyses performed at the satellite s in service date and re evaluated periodically 
a decrease in the useful life of a satellite would result in increased depreciation expense 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments as of december   the company had million of cash  short term investments and restricted cash  of which million is in the form of short term investments and million is in the form of restricted cash million included in other current assets and million included in other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet 
short term investments consist of investments whose maturity at time of purchase was 
table of contents greater than days and less than one year or investments which had been long term whose final maturity is less than one year from december management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and at each balance sheet date 
our short term investments include corporate bonds  euro dollar bonds  certificates of deposit  commercial paper  federal agency notes and auction rate securities 
auction rate securities  long term obligations that are sold and purchased through an auction process for a period of   or days  are considered to be short term investments and are classified as available for sale securities 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  if any  reported in accumulated other comprehensive income 
billed receivables  vendor financing and long term receivables we are required to estimate the collectibility of our billed receivables  vendor financing and long term receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the collectibility of these receivables  including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
charges for recoveries of bad debts recorded to the income statement on billed receivables for the year ended december   the periods october  to december  and january  to december  and for the year ended december   were million  million  million  and million  respectively 
at december  and  billed receivables were net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 
we evaluate specific accounts when we become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to a deterioration of its financial condition  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are re evaluated periodically 
inventories inventories are reviewed for estimated obsolescence or unusable items and  if appropriate  are written down to the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional inventory write downs may be required 
these are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the inventory 
charges for inventory obsolescence recorded to the income statement for the year ended december   the period october  to december   the period january  to october  and for the year ended december  were million  million  million  and million  respectively 
evaluation of satellites and other long lived assets for impairment we periodically evaluate our satellites and other long lived assets for potential impairment losses  when a change in circumstances occurs  by assessing whether the carrying amount of these assets can be recovered over their remaining lives through future undiscounted expected cash flows generated by those assets excluding financing costs 
if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the long lived asset  an impairment charge would be recorded based on such asset s estimated fair value 
changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period 
estimated future cash flows could be impacted by  among other things changes in estimates of the useful life of the satellite changes in estimates of our ability to operate the satellite at expected levels changes in the manner in which the satellite is to be used the loss of one or several significant customer contracts on the satellite if an impairment loss was indicated for a satellite  such amount would be recognized in the period of occurrence  net of any insurance proceeds to be received so long as such amounts are determinable and receipt is probable 
if no impairment loss was indicated in accordance with sfas  and we received insurance proceeds  the proceeds would be recognized in our consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents taxation new loral  as a delaware company  is subject to us federal  state and local income taxation on its worldwide income 
prior to the effective date  old loral  as a bermuda company  was subject to us taxation on any income that was effectively connected with the conduct of a us trade or business as well as a withholding tax on dividends and interest received from its us subsidiaries 
our us subsidiaries continue to be subject to us taxation on their worldwide income and foreign taxes on certain income from sources outside the united states 
our foreign subsidiaries are subject to taxation in local jurisdictions 
we use the liability method in accounting for taxes whereby income taxes are recognized during the year in which transactions are recorded in the financial statements 
deferred taxes reflect the future tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting and are measured by applying statutory tax rates in effect for the year during which the differences are expected to reverse 
we assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and  based upon this analysis  record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets to the extent recoverability does not satisfy the more likely than not recognition criteria in sfas based upon this analysis  we concluded during the fourth quarter of that  due to insufficient positive evidence substantiating recoverability  a valuation allowance should be established for our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million  which when offset by our deferred tax liabilities of million and our valuation allowance of million  resulted in a net deferred tax liability of million on our consolidated balance sheet 
for  we continued to maintain the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets  other than the million asset for our amt credit carryforwards  decreasing the valuation allowance at december  of million by million to a balance of million at december   which included million relating to the opening balance at october  we will maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
if  in the future  we were to determine that we will be able to realize all or a portion of the benefit from our deferred tax assets  any reduction to the valuation allowance as of october  will first reduce goodwill  then other intangible assets with any excess treated as an increase to paid in capital 
during  we reversed million of excess valuation allowance relating to the balance as of october   which was recorded as a reduction to goodwill 
our policy is to establish tax contingency liabilities for potential audit issues 
the tax contingency liabilities are based on our estimate of the probable amount of additional taxes that may be due in the future 
any additional taxes due would be determined only upon completion of current and future federal  state and international tax audits 
at december   we had million of tax contingency liabilities included in long term liabilities 
at december   we had million and million of tax contingency liabilities included in long term liabilities and income taxes payable  respectively 
during  we increased the tax contingency liabilities by million through the current income tax provision  settled million with payment and reversed million of the opening balance as of october  to goodwill for issues where the statute of limitations on assessment of tax had expired during see notes and to the financial statements 
pension and other employee benefits we maintain a pension plan and a supplemental retirement plan 
these plans are defined benefit pension plans 
in addition to providing pension benefits  we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees and dependents 
these pension and other employee benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
material changes in these pension and other employee postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions  as well as our actual experience 
the discount rate is subject to change each year  based on a hypothetical yield curve developed from a portfolio of high quality  corporate  non callable bonds with maturities that match our projected benefit payment stream 
the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of the plan liability cash flows to the yield curve 
changes in applicable high quality long term corporate bond indices  such as the moody s aa corporate bond index  are also considered 
the discount rate determined on this basis was as of december   an increase of basis points from 
table of contents december  this had the effect of reducing our benefit obligations for pensions by million and for other employee benefits by million as of december   as compared with december  the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the expected duration of the plan s projected benefit obligation  asset mix and the fact that its assets are actively managed to mitigate risk 
allowable investment types include equity investments and fixed income investments 
pension plan assets are managed by russell investment corp 
russell  which allocates the assets into specified russell designed funds as we direct 
each specified russell fund is then managed by investment managers chosen by russell 
the targeted long term allocation of our pension plan assets is in equity investments and in fixed income investments 
based on this target allocation  the twenty year historical return of our asset mix has been 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets determined on this basis was for  and for  we will use an expected long term rate of return of 
effective july   we amended our pension plan to standardize the future benefits earned at all company locations 
these amendments did not change any benefits earned through june  as a result of the amendments  all locations now have a career average plan that requires a contribution in order to receive the highest level of benefits 
all current participants now earn future benefits under the same formula and have the same early retirement provisions 
the amendments did not apply to certain employees under a bargaining unit arrangement 
additionally  employees hired after june   do not participate in the defined benefit pension plan but participate in our defined contribution savings plan with an enhanced benefit 
as a result of these amendments  our ongoing pension expense has been reduced commencing july   and it is expected that our cash funding requirement will be less than previously anticipated commencing in these pension and other employee postretirement benefit costs are expected to decrease to approximately million in from million in  primarily due to the full year effect of the july  pension plan amendment  partially offset by the reduction to the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
lowering the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return each by would have increased these pension and other employee postretirement benefits costs by approximately million and million  respectively  in the benefit obligations for pensions and other employee benefits exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million at december  the unfunded benefit obligations 
in connection with our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  sfas  we are required to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan on our balance sheet 
as a result  we reduced our recorded liability for pensions by million  with a corresponding credit to accumulated other comprehensive income  and increased our recorded liability for other benefits by million  with a corresponding charge to other comprehensive income  to adjust to our actual unfunded benefit obligations 
the unfunded benefit obligations were measured using a discount rate of as of december  lowering the discount rate by would have increased the unfunded benefit obligations by approximately million 
market conditions and interest rates significantly affect future assets and liabilities of loral s pension and other employee benefits plans stock based compensation effective october   in connection with our adoption of fresh start accounting  we adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation  for all stock options granted by us after october   pursuant to the prospective method provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
we use the black scholes merton option pricing model to measure fair value of these stock option awards 
this is the same method we used in prior years for disclosure purposes 
the black scholes merton model requires us to make significant judgments regarding the assumptions used within the model  the most significant of which are the stock price volatility assumption  the expected life of the option award  the risk free rate of return and dividends during the expected term 
we emerged from bankruptcy on november   and as a result  we do not have sufficient stock price history upon which to base our volatility assumption 
in determining the volatility used in our model  we considered the volatility of the stock prices of selected companies in the satellite industry  the nature of those companies  our emergence from bankruptcy and other factors in determining our stock price volatility 
for  we used a stock 
table of contents price volatility assumption of 
we based our estimate of the average life of a stock option of years using the midpoint between the vesting and expiration dates as allowed by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  based upon the vesting period of years and the option term of seven years 
our risk free rate of return assumption for options granted in of was based on the quoted yield for five year us treasury bonds as of the date of grant see note to the financial statements 
we assumed no dividends during the expected term 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the amount by which the company s reorganization equity value exceeded the fair value of its tangible assets and identified intangible assets less its liabilities as determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas  as of october  pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill is not amortized and is subject to an annual impairment test which the company  with the assistance of an independent appraiser  performs on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
our test of goodwill impairment for did not result in any goodwill impairment 
goodwill is allocated to our reporting units the operating segment 
sfas requires the company to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount on an annual basis to determine if there is potential impairment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value see note to the financial statements 
intangible assets consist primarily of backlog  orbital slots  trade names and customer relationships  all of which were recorded in connection with the adoption of fresh start accounting 
we used the work of an independent appraiser to assist us in determining the fair value of our intangible assets 
the fair values were calculated using several approaches that encompassed the use of excess earnings  relief from royalty and the build up methods 
the excess earnings  relief from royalty and build up approaches are variations of the income approach 
the income approach  more commonly known as the discounted cash flow approach  estimates fair value based on the cash flows that an asset can be expected to generate over its useful life 
identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
contingencies contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss  if any 
we accrue for costs relating to litigation  claims and other contingent matters when such liabilities become probable and reasonably estimable 
such estimates may be based on advice from third parties or on management s judgment  as appropriate 
actual amounts paid may differ from amounts estimated  and such differences will be charged to operations in the period in which the final determination of the liability is made 
management considers the assessment of loss contingencies as a critical accounting policy because of the significant uncertainty relating to the outcome of any potential legal actions and other claims and the difficulty of predicting the likelihood and range of the potential liability involved  coupled with the material impact on our results of operations that could result from legal actions or other claims and assessments 
the most important contingencies affecting our financial statements are detailed in note to the financial statements  commitments and contingencies 
liquidity and capital resources cash and available credit as of december   the company had million of cash  short term investments and restricted cash  of which is in the form of short term investments and million is in the form of restricted cash million included in other current assets and million included in other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet 
during the next months  we expect to use a significant portion of our available cash and short term investments  as well as proceeds from the preferred stock financing  for the telesat acquisition  capital expenditures  including the continued construction of telstar n and facilities expansion for the satellite manufacturing segment  and for working capital requirements 
we believe that cash and short term investments 
table of contents as of december   net cash provided by operating activities and the proceeds from the preferred stock financing  will be adequate to meet our expected cash requirement for activities in the normal course of business  planned capital expenditures and the telesat acquisition  through at least the next months 
on december   a joint venture formed by the company and its canadian partner  psp  entered into a definitive agreement with bce inc to acquire of the stock of telesat canada and certain other assets for cad billion approximately billion based on an exchange rate of cad 
our net cash funding requirement for this transaction will be funded from some or all of the following cash and short term investments  a portion of the proceeds from the preferred stock financing or cash flow from operations 
if the telesat acquisition and the skynet transaction had occurred on december   loral s net cash funding requirements would have amounted to approximately million 
see the telesat canada transaction below 
while operating during bankruptcy  the company was restricted in its investment options for surplus cash by the us trustee  resulting in our being able to only invest our surplus cash in an approved money market fund 
since emerging from bankruptcy  the company has reviewed its investment options and has developed an investment program that increases return while maintaining a conservative risk profile 
the company adopted an investment policy statement that establishes conservative policies relating to and governing the investment of its surplus cash 
the investment policy does not permit the company to engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does it permit the company to hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the investment policy was designed to preserve capital and safeguard principal  to meet all liquidity requirements of the company and to provide a competitive rate of return 
the investment policy addresses dealer qualifications  lists approved securities  establishes minimum acceptable credit ratings  sets concentration limits  defines a maturity structure  requires all firms to safe keep securities on our behalf  requires certain mandatory reporting activity and discusses review of the portfolio 
the company operates its investment program under the guidelines of its investment policy 
on february   loral completed a million preferred stock financing pursuant to the securities purchase agreement entered into with mhr on october  loral sold  shares of its series a perpetual preferred stock the series a preferred stock and  shares of its series b perpetual preferred stock the series b preferred stock and together with the series a preferred stock  the loral series preferred stock at a purchase price of per share to various funds affiliated with mhr 
each share of the series a preferred stock is convertible  at the option of the holder  into ten shares of loral common stock at an initial conversion price of per share 
following shareholder approval of the creation of a new class of class b non voting common stock  each share of the series b preferred stock will be convertible  at the option of the holder  into ten shares of this class b non voting common stock at an initial conversion price of per share 
under certain circumstances  the series b preferred stock and the class b non voting common stock may also be converted by the holder into loral common stock  in the case of the series b preferred stock  at the same conversion price  and in the case of the class b non voting common stock  on a share for share basis 
the initial conversion price reflects a premium of to the closing price of loral s common stock on the day before the securities purchase agreement was entered into 
dividends on the loral series preferred stock will be paid in kind ie  in additional shares of loral series preferred stock through april thereafter  if loral satisfies certain financial requirements  the dividends will be payable in cash or in kind at loral s option 
pursuant to the terms of this financing  mhr has the right to nominate one additional member to the loral board 
as a result of the difference between the fair market value of the common stock on the date the financing was completed  as compared to the initial conversion price  the company will reflect a beneficial conversion feature of the loral series preferred stock as a component of its earnings per share calculation for the quarter ended march  for the series a preferred stock and for the series b preferred stock  in the period in which shareholder approval of the creation of the new class of class b non voting common stock is received 
this beneficial conversion feature  currently estimated to be a maximum of approximately million in the aggregate assuming shareholder approval of the class b non voting common stock is obtained and before any discount in value for the class b non voting common stock because of its non voting status  will not be recorded as a charge to net income  but will serve as a one time reduction in the calculation of both the basic and diluted earnings per share results 
accordingly  our basic and diluted earnings per share results will be reduced by approximately per share for the beneficial conversion feature for such periods  in the aggregate 
in the future  to the extent that dividends on the loral series preferred stock are paid in additional shares of loral series preferred stock  we 
table of contents will incur additional beneficial conversion features that would affect the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations in a similar manner 
we plan to use the proceeds from this preferred stock financing  together with our existing resources  to meet some or all of the following needs a funding the long term growth of our businesses by constructing satellites for our satellite services business and by expanding our satellite manufacturing business including both facilities expansion and working capital requirements  and b equipping us to respond quickly to strategic transactions or alliances  including the completion of the telesat acquisition 
it is possible  however  that we will further access the financial markets to meet these objectives or to better position our capital structure 
approximately million in the aggregate is required to pay the remaining claims from the plan of reorganization and the expenses associated with completing the reorganization activity and will be paid from existing cash on hand 
cash requirements at satellite manufacturing are driven primarily by working capital requirements to finance long term receivables associated with satellite contracts and capital spending required to maintain and expand the manufacturing facility 
we believe that the satellite manufacturing cash flow from operations is sufficient to fund the capital required to maintain the current manufacturing operations and working capital associated with our current backlog level 
capital requirements to expand the manufacturing facility beyond its current capabilities and offer customer financing terms beyond standard terms will be funded from some or all of the following cash and short term investments  the proceeds from the preferred stock financing  cash flow from operations  or through additional financing activity 
the incremental cost of such expansions or upgrades could be up to million over the next three years 
historically  a portion of satellite manufacturing revenues are paid to ss l in the form of orbitals  receivable payments from its customers that are earned over the life of the satellite 
these payments are contingent upon continued satellite performance 
as of december   ss l had orbital receivables of million  which will be received over years  an increase of million from orbital receivables of million as of december  continued growth in the satellite manufacturing business will result in a corresponding growth in the amount of such orbital receivables 
to fund such growth  ss l may be required to obtain additional financing 
annual receipts from the existing satellite services business are fairly predictable because they are primarily derived from an established base of long term customer contracts and high contract renewal rates 
we believe that the satellite services cash flow from operations will be sufficient to provide for its maintenance capital requirements and to fund any cash portion of its interest and preferred dividend obligations through the closing of the skynet transaction 
cash required for the construction of the telstar n satellite will be funded from some or all of the following cash and short term investments  the proceeds from the preferred stock financing  cash flow from operations  or through additional financing activity 
on november   ss l entered into a million amended and restated letter of credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank extending the maturity date of the facility to december  on october   ss l entered into an amendment to this amended and restated letter of credit agreement further extending the maturity of the facility to december  and reducing the facility availability to million

on june   ss l entered into a customer credit agreement the credit agreement with sirius satellite radio inc sirius  effective as of may  under the credit agreement  ss l has agreed  if requested  to make loans to sirius in an aggregate principal amount of up to million to finance the purchase of the sirius fm satellite the satellite  including to reimburse sirius for certain payments made by it under the satellite purchase agreement with ss l dated may  the purchase agreement 
any loans made under the credit agreement will be secured by sirius rights under the purchase agreement  including its rights to the satellite 
the loans also will be guaranteed by satellite cd radio  a subsidiary of sirius inc  and  subject to certain exceptions  will be guaranteed by any future material subsidiary that may be formed by sirius thereafter 
the maturity date of any loans will be the earliest to occur of i april   ii days after the satellite becomes available for shipment and iii days prior to the scheduled launch of the satellite 
loans made under the credit

as of december   sirius was eligible to borrow million under the credit agreement 
on november   loral skynet completed the sale of million of senior secured notes the loral skynet notes 
the loral skynet notes mature on november  and bear interest at payable semi annually beginning july  no principal payments prior to the maturity date are required 
on july   loral skynet paid accrued interest of million in cash 
the loral skynet notes are guaranteed by certain of loral skynet s subsidiaries 
the obligations of loral skynet and the subsidiary guarantors are secured by a first priority lien on certain specified assets of loral skynet and the guarantors pursuant to the security agreements entered into on november  the related indenture contains restrictive covenants that limit  subject to certain exceptions  loral skynet s and its subsidiaries ability to take certain actions  including restricted payments  as defined  incurrence of debt  incurrence of liens  payment of certain dividends or distributions  issuance or sale of capital stock of subsidiaries  sale of assets  affiliate transactions and sale leaseback and merger transactions 
our ability to redeem these notes in the near term is limited 
prior to november   we may redeem the notes at a redemption price of plus accrued and unpaid interest  unless we receive an objection notice from holders of two thirds of the principal amount of the notes 
after this period  the notes are redeemable at our option at a redemption price of  declining over time to in  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
proceeds from the sale of the loral skynet notes were used to acquire certain satellite services assets from old loral and certain of its subsidiaries and to fund certain cash claims in accordance with the plan of reorganization redemption of the loral skynet notes is a condition to the closing of the skynet transaction

in connection with the telesat transaction  loral skynet has entered into certain derivative transactions 
in the event that the telesat acquisition failed to close and we had to unwind these derivative transactions  loral skynet could have liability exposure of up to million depending on currency rate fluctuations  as of march  see note to the financial statements

the telesat canada transaction on december   a joint venture company acquireco formed by loral and its canadian partner  the public sector pension investment board psp entered into a definitive agreement with bce inc to acquire of the stock of telesat canada and certain other assets from bce inc for cad billion approximately billion based on an exchange rate of cad  which purchase price is not subject to adjustment for telesat canada s performance during the pre closing period 
under the terms of this purchase agreement  the economic value of telesat canada s business is  subject to certain exceptions  being operated for acquireco s benefit beginning from december  telesat canada is the leading satellite services provider in canada and earns its revenues principally through the provision of broadcast and business network services over seven in orbit satellites 
this transaction is subject to various closing conditions  including approvals of the relevant canadian and us government authorities  and is expected to close in mid loral and psp have agreed to guarantee and  respectively  of acquireco s obligations under the telesat share purchase agreement  up to cad million 
at the time of  or following the telesat acquisition  substantially all of loral skynet s assets and related liabilities will be transferred to a subsidiary of acquireco at an agreed upon enterprise valuation  subject to downward adjustment under certain circumstances the skynet transaction 
this subsidiary will be combined with telesat canada and the resulting new entity new telesat will be a canadian company that will be headquartered in ottawa 
following the completion of the skynet transaction  new telesat will be the world s 
table of contents fourth largest operator of telecommunications satellites  with a combined fleet of eleven in orbit satellites and four additional satellites to be placed in service over the next four years 
new telesat will feature a management team to be drawn from both telesat canada and loral skynet

loral skynet s satellite fleet provides an array of video and data services primarily outside of north america  and will complement telesat canada s north american fleet  which hosts video and data distribution services across north america  as well as serving as the platform for canada s two premier direct to home video services 
we and psp have arranged for the parent company of acquireco holdings to obtain billion of committed debt financing from a group of financial institutions  of which up to approximately billion is available to fund the purchase price of the telesat acquisition 
psp has agreed to contribute approximately cad million in cash to holdings  of which million or cad million based on an exchange rate of cad will be for the purchase of a holdings fixed rate senior non convertible mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
in addition to loral s agreement to transfer the loral skynet assets to new telesat  loral will have net cash funding requirements in connection with the transaction  which  had the telesat acquisition and the skynet transaction occurred on december   would have amounted to approximately million 
loral skynet s existing preferred stock and senior notes will be redeemed in connection with the skynet transaction

table of contents loral skynet telesat cad in millions revenues adjusted ebitda operating income net income loss cash and cash equivalents total assets debt  including current portion shareholders equity backlog synergies the combination of loral skynet and telesat canada will provide the opportunity for new telesat to benefit from synergies in those areas where redundancies exist 
these areas include overhead and support functions  space segment facilities and ground segment facilities 
during an implementation period of less than one year  we expect to incur non recurring charges of approximately cad million to cad million to effect such cost savings 
after this implementation period  it is expected that new telesat would benefit from approximately cad million to cad million annually from these synergies  some portion of which we expect will be realized commencing immediately after closing of the transaction 
the summary financial information included herein does not include the benefit from any cost saving synergies which may be achievable after the close of the transactions 
nor does the summary financial data include non recurring charges such as the costs to implement these synergies as discussed above  transaction related payments to executive management of telesat canada upon closing the telesat acquisition of approximately cad million  payments under retention plans of approximately cad million and redemption premiums relating to the early extinguishment of loral skynet s and telesat canada s debt of approximately cad million 
liquidity the telesat purchase price of cad billion as well as acquisition fees and expenses and the repayment of existing loral skynet and telesat financing will be financed by cash from loral and psp  as well as borrowings by new telesat 
although a significant portion of the financing commitment is in us dollars  the following descriptions of such cash requirements and borrowings are stated in canadian dollars cad 
where applicable  canadian dollars have been translated to us dollars at the december  exchange rate of cad new telesat will have capital expenditure requirements of approximately million over the next three years  as more fully described in capital expenditures below 
this requirement is expected to be funded by cash flow from operations as well as the availability of the term loan b see below 
new telesat does not expect to have a significant cash requirement for taxes in the near future due to deductions for the interest cost to be incurred and future depreciation and amortization 
equity and funding requirements at the time of  or following the telesat acquisition  substantially all of loral skynet s assets and related liabilities will be transferred to a subsidiary of acquireco at an agreed upon enterprise valuation  subject to downward adjustment under certain circumstances 
psp has agreed to contribute approximately cad million in cash to holdings  of which million cad million will be for the purchase of a holdings fixed rate senior non convertible mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
at closing of the telesat acquisition  assuming a simultaneous closing of the skynet transaction  we would hold equity interests in holdings  the ultimate parent company of new telesat  effectively representing of the economic interests and of the voting power  of new telesat 
psp would in turn acquire the preferred stock 
table of contents described above  and equity interests effectively representing of the economic interest  and together with two other canadian investors  of the voting power of new telesat 
if the telesat acquisition and the skynet transaction were to occur at the same time  then on the closing date  holdings will redeem the principal amount of loral skynet s outstanding senior notes approximately million as of december  and loral will redeem loral skynet s outstanding preferred stock and accrued dividends thereon approximately million as of december   as well as pay all interest and redemption premium approximately million as of december  and any other amounts that may be due in respect of loral skynet s senior notes 
see risk factors financial and telesat transaction risk factors 
if the skynet transaction does not close simultaneously with the telesat acquisition  loral would in place of funding the redemption of loral skynet s preferred stock and accrued dividends and interest and redemption premium on loral skynet s senior notes approximately million as of december   make a cash equity contribution to holdings of cad million approximately million to acquire redeemable shares of holdings 
upon the later closing of the skynet transaction  holdings will draw upon its credit facilities to redeem the principal amount of loral skynet s senior notes and the redeemable shares issued to loral 
loral will use the proceeds from holdings to redeem loral skynet s preferred stock and pay the interest  premium and any other amounts due under the loral skynet notes 
loral s economic interest in holdings would be proportionately reduced from to approximately  assuming an exchange rate of cad  to reflect the fact that it has not contributed the skynet assets into new telesat  but would be reinstated to upon the closing of the skynet transaction 
we would have a year from the closing of the telesat acquisition to complete the skynet transaction 
if we are unable to close the skynet transaction during that period  we would then be required  under the terms of our agreement with psp  to contribute our rights to the telstar n satellite as well as million in cash the alternative contribution to new telesat  in order to bring our economic interest in holdings to 
see risk factors financial and telesat transaction risk factors 
to the extent necessary  upon closing of the telesat acquisition  the skynet transaction and or the alternative contribution  as the case may be  there will be an appropriate cash true up between us  psp and new telesat to reflect the amount of our relative contributions  after giving effect to among other things  the exchange rate then in effect  gains and or losses on hedging transactions  the spending on telstar n  in the event of a material adverse change to loral skynet s business during the interim period  the resulting diminution in the agreed upon value of loral skynet  and in the event the alternative contribution is effected in place of the skynet transaction  the extent to which the value of the alternative contribution is greater or less than the agreed upon value of the skynet transaction 
debt in connection with the acquisition we have received a commitment from a syndicate of banks to provide new telesat with  in each case as described below  senior secured credit facilities the credit facility and a senior bridge facility the bridge facility together the facilities 
as is customary with such facilities  the lead arrangers of such facilities have reserved the right at any time  after consulting with us  to change the pricing  structure or other terms of the facilities to ensure a successful syndication 
it is the current intent to issue on the acquisition date senior unsecured notes that will make it unnecessary to draw on the bridge facility 
if the bridge facility is drawn  new telesat would intend to refinance it promptly through the issuance of replacement senior unsecured notes 
it is expected that the senior unsecured notes would have standard market terms and conditions for a financing of this type 
senior secured credit facilities the credit facility will consist of the following tranches that each contain a discussion of its costs  terms and conditions 
the applicable margins of the facilities will be based upon the achievement of certain credit ratings and the lenders will have the ability to increase such margins depending on agreed upon conditions up to at the maximum 

table of contents term loan a the cad million loan million will have a maturity of five years from issuance 
the term loan a will be denominated in cad and will bear interest at a floating rate of the bankers acceptance rate plus an applicable margin 
term loan b the term loan b facility is for a billion loan with a maturity of seven years from issuance 
in order to hedge the currency risk for new telesat both at closing and over the life of the loans  loral skynet entered into a currency basis swap to synthetically convert the us dollar commitment to cad billion 
an additional feature of the basis swap is that the term loan b will bear interest at a floating rate of bankers acceptance plus an applicable margin 
for more information about the basis swap see note to the consolidated financial statements 
term loan b the term loan b facility is a million cad million loan with a maturity of seven years after the closing date of the telesat acquisition  which bears interest at libor plus an applicable margin 
the term loan b includes the option for a year delayed draw period so proceeds can be used to repay loral skynet s existing financing arrangements if the skynet transaction were to occur after the closing of the telesat acquisition 
if the closing of the telesat acquisition and the skynet transaction were to occur simultaneously  the term loan b will be drawn at the acquisition closing to fund the telesat acquisition 
term loan b the term loan b facility is a million cad million delayed draw loan with the same interest rate and maturity as the term loan b the term loan b is available to be drawn for months after the closing of the acquisition to fund satellite capital expenditures 
the undrawn amount of the term loan b is subject to a commitment fee 
revolving credit the credit facility also includes a cad denominated revolving credit facility of up to the canadian dollar equivalent of million cad million that is expected to be undrawn at the closing of the acquisition 
the revolving credit facility matures five years after issuance and is available to be drawn at any time 
the drawn loans will bear interest at libor plus an applicable margin 
undrawn amounts under the facility are subject to a commitment fee 
senior bridge facility the bridge facility is a committed million cad  million senior unsecured loan available to the borrower on the closing date of the acquisition 
the bridge facility has a maturity of one year and an initial interest rate per annum equal to the greater of a fixed percentage or three month libor plus the applicable margin  excluding any additional payment required to compensate lenders for canadian withholding tax 
the applicable margin increases over time up to a cap 
lenders under the bridge facility have also committed to provide rollover loans at the maturity of the bridge facility for an additional seven years 
the current intent is not to borrow the bridge facility but instead to issue senior unsecured notes to finance the telesat acquisition 
however  if for any reason the senior notes are not issued at closing  the bridge facility is available to fund the acquisition 
interest expense an estimate of the interest expense on the facilities after they are drawn down is based upon assumptions of libor and bankers acceptance rates and the applicable margin for the facilities 
based upon market conditions at december  and assuming the bridge facility is not drawn upon  it is estimated that new telesat s interest expense in the first full year of operations would be approximately cad million 
if the bridge facility were to 
table of contents be drawn upon  it is estimated this interest expense could increase by approximately cad million  assuming cad million to compensate lenders for canadian withholding tax 
the historical results of loral skynet and telesat canada for  include interest expense of approximately cad million and cad million  respectively  for debt that will be refinanced in connection with the telesat acquisition and the skynet transaction  a portion of which was capitalized in connection with satellites under construction 
capital expenditures telesat canada has entered into satellite construction contracts for the anik f  nimiq and nimiq satellites and loral skynet has entered into a satellite construction contract for telstar n 
capital expenditure requirements for these contracts total approximately million in  million in and million in these expenditures will be funded by new telesat s cash flow from operations as well as the delayed draw term loan b incremental cash operating costs for new satellites entering the fleet is typically approximately cad million annually  primarily for insurance 
backlog as of december   the backlog of loral skynet and telesat canada was cad million and cad billion  respectively and there were approximately mhz equivalent transponders that were not utilized and available for lease on the loral skynet and telesat canada in orbit satellites 
included in the backlog of telesat canada as of december   is cad billion for mhz equivalent transponders on satellites under construction as detailed in capital expenditures above 
these transponders have been leased under contracts expected to generate aggregate revenue of approximately cad million annually for the life of the satellites 
in addition  these contracts contain provisions such that the customers  assuming the respective satellites are successfully launched and are operating nominally  may only terminate their contracts by paying telesat canada the present value of the entire contracted amounts that would have been due for the remaining life of the satellite 
as of december   there are approximately mhz equivalent transponders that are available for lease on the loral skynet and telesat canada satellites under construction 
loral skynet and telesat canada have received approximately cad million of customer prepayments  including in the case of telesat canada  approximately cad million relating to satellites under construction 
if the launch of such satellite s under construction were to fail  telesat canada would be obligated to return the customer prepayments applicable to such satellite 
such repayment obligations would be funded by insurance proceeds  cash on hand and or availability under the revolving credit facility 
telesat canada anticipates that in the event of a satellite launch failure the customer would contract with them for replacement capacity 
revenue to be realized from backlog as of december   the amount of non cash revenue that represents amortization of existing customer prepayments and the number of mhz equivalent transponders expected to be available for lease at the beginning of each year are as follows loral skynet telesat canada non cash non cash annual revenue transponders annual revenue transponders revenue related to available revenue related to available from customer mhz from customer mhz backlog prepayments equivalents backlog prepayments equivalents cad in millions cad in millions cad in millions cad in millions thereafter total

as part of the transaction  the acquisition company received financing commitments from a syndicate of banks for billion of senior secured credit facilities and million of a senior unsecured bridge facility 
the purchase price of telesat canada is in canadian dollars  while most of the debt financing is in us dollars 
accordingly  loral and psp have entered into financial commitments to lock in exchange rates to convert some of the us dollar denominated debt proceeds to canadian dollars 
as such  loral entered into several transactions through its loral skynet subsidiary  whereby loral skynet guaranteed certain exposures should the telesat acquisition not close and the transactions are unwound

interest the company issued long term fixed rate debt at its loral skynet corporation subsidiary upon emergence from bankruptcy 
as these instruments are at a fixed rate  the company does not have any exposure to changes in interest rates with respect thereto

as of december   the company held million in marketable securities consisting of corporate bonds  euro dollar bonds  certificates of deposits  commercial paper  federal agency notes and auction rate securities 
we invest in marketable securities with the intent to hold them to maturity and classify them as such  except for the auction rate securities which we classify as available for sale 
at december   the longest maturity date for one of our investments was days and the weighted average maturity of our marketable securities was approximately days 
due to the short term maturity of our investments and our intent to hold them to maturity  we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is not significant
