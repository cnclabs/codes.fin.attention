revenue and volume growth during  our consolidated bottle and can net price per case grew percent  while our volume increased percent 
in north america  we experienced moderate bottle and can net price per case improvement of percent and limited volume growth of percent 
our volume growth was limited due to weak carbonated soft drink csd category trends and downward pressure attributable to higher price increases that were implemented to cover rising raw material costs 
our increased pricing was offset partially by negative mix  which resulted from competitive pricing pressures in the water category and a decline in higher margin immediate consumption sales 
our volume results were once again impacted by a shifting consumer preference for diet and lower calorie beverages  as evidenced by a percent decline in our sugared csd portfolio 
we continued to benefit from recent product innovation  which drove higher volumes in several high growth and high margin categories  such as isotonics and energy drinks 
in europe  we achieved balanced volume and pricing growth  which included a percent increase in volume and a percent increase in bottle and can net price per case 
these results were driven by the strong execution of a number of operating and sales initiatives  including world cup activation and boost zones in france  which helped drive higher immediate consumption growth 
in our continental european territories we experienced renewed csd growth  which resulted in a volume increase of percent 
our results in great britain  which represents nearly half of our european business  were not as strong due to continued marketplace challenges  including persistent csd category weakness and difficult retail trends 
cost of sales the cost environment across all of our territories continued to be challenging during  particularly in north america  where our year over year bottle and can ingredient and packaging cost per case increased percent 
this increase was driven by higher cost associated with package mix shifts  a moderate increase in the cost of concentrate  and increased conversion costs due to higher energy prices 
we also experienced increases in the cost of certain materials  particularly aluminum  pet plastic  and hfcs 
during  we expect our cost of sales per case to increase significantly due to double digit growth in the cost of aluminum and hfcs 

table of contents operating expenses the benefit of ongoing operating expense initiatives allowed us to successfully control the growth of our underlying operating expenses during we intend to remain diligent in our efforts to manage our operating expenses during in order to maintain the flexibility needed to deal with the expected challenges of a difficult raw material cost environment 
franchise impairment charge during  we recorded a billion billion net of tax  or per common share non cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of our north american franchise license intangible assets to their estimated fair value based upon the results of our annual impairment test of these assets 
if  in the future  the estimated fair value of our north american franchise rights were to decline further  it would be necessary to record an additional non cash impairment charge 
the decline in the estimated fair value of our north american franchise intangible assets reflects the negative impact of several contributing factors  which resulted in a reduction in the forecasted cash flows and growth rates used to estimate fair value 
these factors include  but are not limited to  an extraordinary increase in raw material costs expected in  driven by significant increases in the cost of aluminum and hfcs  a challenging marketplace environment including continued weakness in the csd category and increased pricing pressures in several high growth categories  such as water  and increased interest rates contributing to a higher discount rate and capital charge 
furthermore  the business and marketplace environments in which we currently operate differ significantly from the historical environments that drove the business cases used to value and record the acquisition of certain of our north american franchise rights 
accordingly  for certain acquisitions we have been unable to attain the forecasted growth projections that were used to value the franchise rights at the time they were acquired 
for additional information about our franchise license intangible assets and the related non cash impairment charge  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our strategic priorities in order to remain focused on implementing a strategic  long term business plan that will position our organization to excel in a dynamic and changing market environment  we have identified three priorities that are essential to our transformation 
the following is a summary of the key initiatives that we believe will help drive our future performance strengthen our brand portfolio we must continue to strengthen our position in each beverage category by growing the value of our existing brands  while at the same time strategically broadening our presence in fast growing beverage groups 
our current portfolio remains heavily dependent on csd products  however  over the next five years  most volume growth in the nonalcoholic ready to drink category will come from water  juices and juice drinks  and other noncarbonated beverages 
while carbonated beverages remain profitable and vital to our success  the broadening of our presence in faster growing beverage groups is necessary 
essential to our future growth is leveraging our powerful relationship with tccc  which itself is dedicated to expanding its product portfolio and competing more fully for every beverage purchase 
tccc demonstrated its commitment early in with the announcement that it would acquire fuze beverages llc  a maker of enhanced juices and teas 
this acquisition supports other innovation in the growing tea category  such as the expanded nestea line  the new enviga green tea  premium gold peak teas  and our expanded relationship with arizona tea 
transform our go to market model and improve efficiency and effectiveness we must be flexible to transform our go to market model in order to improve customer service and in store execution while embracing the most effective distribution channels for each of our products 

table of contents our direct store delivery dsd model remains the fastest and most powerful method of distributing the vast majority of our products 
among other advantages  our dsd model allows us to remain in continuous contact with our customers  giving us the ability to seize in store placement opportunities  and rapidly establish new products in emerging categories 
however  shifts in consumer demand for increasingly specialized products  coupled with a rapidly evolving retail environment  have created new distribution realities that cannot be ignored 
the proliferation of brands  packages  and products necessitates that we take a fresh look at how we bring each of our products to market 
during  we moved forward in testing new delivery opportunities  including warehouse delivery of certain products to wal mart and valero  a large convenience store operator 
these projects demonstrate our commitment to evolving our go to market model to meet the demands of a changing marketplace 
as we refine our dsd model  we must also seek opportunities to improve our efficiency and effectiveness 
this includes driving improved consistency and best practices across our organization 
in recent years  we have made significant strides in this area  including redesigning our north american business model  reorganizing certain aspects of our operations in europe  and consolidating certain administrative  financial  and accounting functions for north america into a single shared services center 
we believe  however  that additional efforts to enhance our efficiency could yield even greater productivity across our organization 
accordingly  we are implementing a host of initiatives to improve our operating performance 
for example  we are moving forward with faster water production lines  more productive selling systems for our customers  more productive delivery vehicles  and synergistic delivery and warehouse practices 
these  and other initiatives underway  represent only the beginning of our commitment to develop more efficient operating methods in order to enhance our performance over the long term 
commitment to our people our people are the key to our success 
as such  we must attract  develop  and retain a highly talented and diverse workforce in order to further establish a winning and inclusive culture 
in order to ensure that our people are able to fully utilize their skills and abilities we must provide them with the right tools and right products to win in the marketplace 
by developing clear  concise job responsibilities  with goals that are clearly understood  and by improving communication to make certain we share best practices effectively  we will create improved customer satisfaction and generate increased productivity

our volume growth was negatively impacted by weak csd category trends and downward pressure due to higher price increases that were implemented to cover rising raw material costs 
our increased pricing was offset partially by competitive pricing pressures in the water category and a decline in immediate consumption sales 
in europe  we achieved balanced volume and pricing growth driven by marketing initiatives  such as world cup activation  the launch of coca cola zero  and boost zones in france 
we experienced renewed csd growth in our continental european territories  but continued to be negatively impacted by persistent csd category weakness in great britain

table of contents our bottle and can sales accounted for percent of our net operating revenues during bottle and can net pricing is based on the invoice price charged to customers reduced by promotional allowances 
bottle and can net pricing per case is impacted by the price charged per package  the volume generated in each package  and the channels in which those packages are sold 
to the extent we are able to increase volume in higher margin packages that are sold through higher margin channels  our bottle and can net pricing per case will increase without an actual increase in wholesale pricing 
the increase in our bottle and can net pricing per case was achieved through higher rates  offset partially by negative mix in north america due to slower immediate consumption sales and increased pricing pressures in the water category 
we participate in various programs and arrangements with customers designed to increase the sale of our products by these customers 
among the programs negotiated are arrangements under which allowances can be earned by customers for attaining agreed upon sales levels or for participating in specific marketing programs 
in the united states  we participate in cooperative trade marketing ctm programs  which are typically developed by us but are administered by tccc 
we are responsible for all costs of these programs in our territories  except for some costs related to a limited number of specific customers 
under these programs  we pay tccc and tccc pays our customers as a representative of the north american bottling system 
coupon programs are also developed on a territory specific basis with the intent of increasing sales by all customers 
we believe our participation in these programs is essential to ensuring continued volume and revenue growth in the competitive marketplace 
the cost of all of these various programs  included as a reduction in net operating revenues  totaled billion in both and these amounts included net customer marketing accrual reductions related to prior year programs of million and million in and  respectively 
the cost of these various programs as a percentage of gross revenues was approximately percent and percent in and  respectively 
the decrease in the cost of these various programs as a percentage of gross revenues was the result of higher promotional activities in in conjunction with the significant product innovation that occurred during we frequently participate with tccc in contractual arrangements at specific athletic venues  school districts  colleges and universities  and other locations  whereby we obtain pouring or vending rights at a specific location in exchange for cash payments 
we record our obligation under each contract at inception and defer and amortize the total required payments using the straight line method over the term of the contract 
at december   the net unamortized balance of these arrangements  which was included in customer distribution rights and other noncurrent assets  net on our consolidated balance sheet  totaled million  million capitalized  net of million in accumulated amortization

the reorganization of our north american operations has resulted in a simplified and flatter organizational structure  has helped facilitate a closer interaction between our front line employees and our customers  and will provide long term cost savings through improved administrative and operating efficiencies 
similarly  the reorganization of certain aspects of our operations in europe has helped improve operating effectiveness and efficiency while enabling our front line employees to better meet the needs of our customers 
in february  we announced a restructuring program to support the implementation of key strategic initiatives designed to achieve long term sustainable growth 
this restructuring program will impact certain aspects of our north american and european operations as well as our corporate headquarters 
through this restructuring program we will enhance standardization in our operating structure and business practices  create a more efficient supply chain and order fulfillment structure  and improve customer service in north america through the implementation of a new selling system for smaller customers

the majority of the expense is expected to be recognized in and on january   we adopted sfas r  which requires the grant date fair value of all share based payment awards  including employee share options  to be recorded as employee compensation expense over the requisite service period

in february  moody s placed our long term rating on review for a possible downgrade 
changes in our operating results  cash flows  or financial position could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies 
should our credit ratings be adjusted downward  we may incur higher costs to borrow  which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
our credit facilities and outstanding notes and debentures contain various provisions that  among other things  require us to limit the incurrence of certain liens or encumbrances in excess of defined amounts

critical accounting policies we make judgmental decisions and estimates with underlying assumptions when applying accounting principles to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
certain critical accounting policies requiring significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions are detailed below 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and changes to the estimate or different estimates  that could have reasonably been used  would have materially changed our consolidated financial statements 
the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of our board of directors 

table of contents we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  should our actual experience differ from these assumptions and other considerations used in estimating these amounts  the impact of these differences could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
impairment testing of goodwill and franchise license intangible assets we perform annual impairment tests of our goodwill and franchise license intangible assets at the north american and european group levels  which are our reporting units 
our franchise license agreements contain performance requirements and convey to us the rights to distribute and sell products of the licensor within specified territories 
our domestic cola franchise license agreements with tccc do not expire  reflecting a long and ongoing relationship 
our agreements with tccc covering our united states non cola  european and canadian operations are renewable periodically 
tccc does not grant perpetual franchise license intangible rights outside the united states  however  these agreements can be renewed for additional terms with minimal cost 
we have received an extension until july of our bottler agreements with tccc for our territories in belgium  continental france  and the netherlands and until august of our bottler agreements with tccc in great britain while we negotiate the renewal of these licenses 
in february  we requested an extension of our bottler agreement with tccc in luxembourg for an additional ten years 
we believe that we and tccc will enter into agreements without material modifications to the terms of the existing agreements and without substantial cost 
we have never had a franchise license agreement with tccc be terminated due to nonperformance of the terms of the agreement or due to a decision by tccc to terminate an agreement at the expiration of a term 
after evaluating the renewal provisions of our franchise license agreements and our mutually beneficial relationship with tccc  we have assigned indefinite lives to all of our franchise license intangible assets 
the fair values calculated in our annual impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  anticipated growth rates by geographic region  our long term anticipated growth rate  the discount rate  and estimates of capital charges for our franchise license intangible assets 
when appropriate  we consider the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use in estimating future cash flows 
in performing our impairment tests  the following critical assumptions were used in determining the fair values of our goodwill and franchise license intangible assets projected operating income growth averaging percent in north america and percent in europe  projected long term growth of percent for determining terminal value  an average discount rate of percent  representing our targeted weighted average cost of capital wacc  and a capital charge for our franchise licenses of percent in north america and percent in europe 
these and other assumptions were impacted by the current economic environment and our current expectations  which could change in the future based on period specific facts and circumstances 
factors inherent in determining our wacc were the value of our common stock  the volatility of our common stock  expected interest costs on debt and debt market conditions  and the amounts and relationships of expected debt and equity capital 
we performed our annual impairment tests of goodwill and franchise license intangible assets as of october  the results of the impairment tests of our goodwill and european franchise license intangible assets indicated that their estimated fair values exceeded their carrying amounts and  therefore  are not impaired 
the results of the impairment test of our north american franchise license intangible assets indicated that their estimated fair value was less than their carrying amount 
as such  we recorded a billion billion net of tax  or per common share non cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of these assets to their estimated fair value 
if  in the future  the estimated fair value of our north american franchise rights were to decline further  it would be necessary to record an additional non cash impairment charge 
the following table 
table of contents summarizes the approximate impact that a change in certain critical assumptions would have on the estimated fair value of our north american franchise license intangible assets the approximate impact of the change in each critical assumption assumes all other assumptions and factors remain constant  in millions  except percentages critical assumption change approximate impact on fair value wacc capital charge estimated operating income estimated operating income for additional information about our goodwill and franchise license intangible assets and the non cash franchise impairment charge  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
pension plan valuations we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our employees in north america and europe 
several critical assumptions are made in determining our pension plan liabilities and related pension expense 
we believe the most critical of these assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long term return on assets eroa 
other assumptions we make are related to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases  mortality rates  retirement patterns and turnover rates 
we determine the discount rate primarily by reference to rates of high quality  long term corporate bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the expected payments to be made under the plans 
decreasing our discount rate percent for the year ended december  by percent would increase our pension expense by approximately million 
the eroa is based on long term expectations given current investment objectives and historical results 
we utilize a combination of active and passive fund management of pension plan assets in order to maximize pension returns within established risk parameters 
we periodically revise asset allocations  where appropriate  to improve returns and manage risk 
pension expense in would increase by approximately million if the eroa were percent lower percent for the year ended december  
as a result of asset losses and the decline of discount rates in recent years  our unrecognized losses now exceed the defined corridor of losses 
this causes our pension expense to be higher  since the excess losses must be amortized to expense until such time as  for example  increases in asset values and or discount rates result in a reduction in unrecognized losses to a point where they do not exceed the defined corridor 
our pension expense was approximately million higher than our pension expense and we expect our pension expense to be approximately million lower than our expense as a result of the amortization of our excess losses 
unrecognized losses  net of gains  totaling million and million were deferred through december  and  respectively 
for additional information about our pension plans  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
tax accounting we recognize valuation allowances when we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets associated with us federal and 
table of contents state and non us net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards totaled million at december  we believe the majority of our deferred tax assets will be realized because of the reversal of certain significant timing differences and anticipated future taxable income from operations 
however  valuation allowances of approximately million have been provided against a portion of our us state and non us carryforwards 
for additional information about our income taxes and tax accounting  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
cold drink equipment placement funding we participate in programs with tccc designed to promote the placement of cold drink equipment jumpstart programs 
we recognize the majority of support payments received from tccc under the jumpstart programs as we place cold drink equipment 
a small portion of the support payments are recognized on a straight line basis over the year period beginning after equipment is placed 
approximately is recognized for each credit that is earned 
our principal requirement under these programs is the placement of equipment 
if  for example  we are unable to earn  credits for placing units of equipment projected to be placed in a given year  we would reduce our recognition in income of deferred cash receipts from tccc by million in that year 
should we not satisfy certain provisions of the programs  the agreements provide for the parties to meet to work out a mutually agreeable solution 
should the parties be unable to agree on alternative solutions  tccc would be able to seek a partial refund 
no refunds of amounts previously earned have ever been paid under the programs and we believe the probability of a partial refund of amounts previously earned under the programs is remote 
we believe we would in all cases resolve any matters that might arise regarding these programs that could potentially result in a refund of amounts previously earned 
at december   million in support payments were deferred under the jumpstart programs 
we believe the most critical assumptions related to the accounting for these programs are the probability of our compliance with the placement and gross profit requirements  as amended  and the probability of tccc asserting their refund rights 
for additional information about our jumpstart programs  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
marketing programs and sales incentives with customers we participate in various programs and arrangements with customers designed to increase the sale of our products by these customers 
among the programs negotiated are arrangements under which allowances can be earned by customers for attaining agreed upon sales levels or for participating in specific marketing programs 
in the united states  we participate in ctm programs  which are typically developed by us but are administered by tccc 
we are responsible for all costs of these programs in our territories  except for some costs related to a limited number of specific customers 
under these programs  we pay tccc and tccc pays our customers as a representative for the north american bottling system 
coupon programs are also developed on a territory specific basis with the intent of increasing sales by all customers 
we believe our participation in these programs is essential to ensuring continued volume and revenue growth in the competitive marketplace 
the costs of all these various programs  included as a reduction in net operating revenues  totaled approximately billion in and and billion in  respectively 
these amounts are net of customer marketing accrual reductions related to prior year programs of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
under customer programs and arrangements that require sales incentives to be paid in advance  we amortize the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume 
when incentives are paid in arrears  we accrue the estimated amount to be paid based upon expected customer performance and estimated sales volume 
these estimates are determined using historical customer experience and other factors  which require significant judgment 
actual amounts paid can differ from these estimates 

table of contents contingencies for information about our contingencies  including outstanding legal cases  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
workforce at december   we had approximately  employees  including  in europe 
approximately  of our employees in north america are covered by collective bargaining agreements in different employee units and essentially all of our employees in europe are covered by local agreements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk current trends and uncertainties interest rate  currency  and commodity price risk management interest rates interest rate risk is present with both fixed and floating rate debt 
we are exposed to interest rate risk in international currencies because of our intent to finance the purchase and cash flow requirements of our international subsidiaries with local borrowings 
interest rates in these markets typically differ from those in the united states 
interest rate swap agreements and other risk management instruments are used  at times  to manage our fixed floating debt profile 
at 
table of contents december   approximately percent of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixed rate debt and percent was floating rate debt 
we did not have any outstanding interest rate swap agreements as of december  we estimate that a one percent change in the interest costs of floating rate debt outstanding at december  would change interest expense on an annual basis by approximately million 
this amount is determined by calculating the effect of a hypothetical interest rate change on our floating rate debt 
this estimate does not include the effects of other possible occurrences such as actions to mitigate this risk or changes in our financial structure 
currency exchange rates our european operations represented approximately percent of our consolidated net operating revenues during and approximately percent of our consolidated long lived assets at december  our canadian operations represented approximately percent of our consolidated net operating revenues during and approximately percent of our consolidated long lived assets at december  we are exposed to translation risk because our operations in canada and europe are in local currency and must be translated into us dollars 
as currency exchange rates fluctuate  translation of the income statements of international businesses into us dollars affects the comparability of revenues and expenses between years 
we hedge a portion of our net investments in international subsidiaries with non us currency denominated debt at the parent company level 
our revenues are denominated in each international subsidiary s local currency  thus  we are not exposed to currency transaction risk on our revenues 
we are exposed to currency transaction risk on certain purchases of raw materials and certain obligations of our international subsidiaries 
we currently use currency forward agreements and option contracts to hedge a certain portion of the aforementioned raw material purchases 
these forward agreements and option contracts are scheduled to expire in for the years ended december    and  the result of a hypothetical percent adverse movement in currency exchange rates applied to the hedging agreements and underlying exposures would not have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
commodity price risk the competitive marketplace in which we operate may limit our ability to recover increased costs through higher prices 
as such  we are subject to market risk with respect to commodity price fluctuations 
we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through the use of supplier pricing agreements  which enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain commodities 
we also  at times  use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to this risk 
aluminum during  we had a supplier pricing agreement for a majority of our north american aluminum purchases that capped the price we paid for aluminum at cents per pound 
this pricing agreement and related price cap expired on december  we have implemented certain hedging strategies  including entering into fixed pricing agreements  in order to mitigate some of our exposure to market price fluctuations in the agreements entered into to date  though  are at rates higher than our expired price cap 
including the effect of the pricing agreements entered into to date  we estimate that a percent increase in the market price per pound of aluminum over the current market price would increase our cost of sales during the twelve months ended december  by approximately million based on our volume levels 

table of contents pet plastic the cost of pet resin  which is a major cost component of our pet bottles  is variable and based on market prices 
we currently do not have hedging instruments to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the market price of resin and  therefore  are subject to market changes 
we estimate that a percent increase in the market price of resin over the current market price would increase our cost of sales during the twelve months ended december  by approximately million based on our volume levels 
high fructose corn syrup hfcs we have entered into pricing agreements with our supplier of hfcs to mitigate our exposure to market price fluctuations in including the effect of these pricing agreements  a percent increase in the market price of hfcs over the current market price would not have a material impact on our cost of sales during the twelve months ended december  vehicle fuel during  we began using derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our vehicle fuel purchases in north america 
the majority of these derivative instruments were designated as cash flow hedges related to the future purchases of vehicle fuel 
including the effect of these hedges  a percent increase in the market price of fuel over the current market price would not have a material impact on our operating expenses during the twelve months ended december
