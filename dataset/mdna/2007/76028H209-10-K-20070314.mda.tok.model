item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and their notes included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  such as those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview repros therapeutics inc the company  rprx  or we  us or our was organized on august  and is a development stage company 
we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of new drugs to treat hormonal and reproductive system disorders 
our lead product candidate  proellex  is an orally available small molecule compound that we are developing for the treatment of uterine fibroids and endometriosis 
we are also developing androxal  which causes increased testosterone secretion from the testes  for the treatment of testosterone deficiency in men resulting from secondary hypogonadism 
we are currently conducting a us phase clinical trial with proellex for the treatment of uterine fibroids and are also conducting a european phase clinical trial with proellex for the treatment of endometriosis 
during december we provided an internally generated interim analysis of our ongoing phase clinical trial of proellex in uterine fibroid patients which demonstrated statistically significant reductions in excessive menstrual bleeding and an improvement in quality of life versus placebo 
furthermore  after three months of treatment  no statistically significant change in endometrial thickness was observed 
also during december we provided an internally generated interim analysis of our ongoing european endometriosis phase clinical trial of proellex which demonstrated that treatment with the highest dose of proellex  mg  achieved statistically significant reduction in days of pain compared to treatment with lupron  the current pharmaceutical standard of care for the treatment of endometriosis 
we have completed a phase clinical trial and during december we provided an internally generated interim analysis from an ongoing non pivotal phase trial of androxal for the treatment of testosterone deficiency in men resulting from secondary hypogonadism 
both trials demonstrated statistically significant increases in testosterone levels versus placebo 
in our current phase trial  at three months  androxal restored testosterone levels to the normal range in over of patients treated 
on february   we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
as a result of the offering  we received approximately million in net proceeds which we intend to use to continue our clinical development of proellex and androxal 
effective january   we voluntarily withdrew the listing of our common stock from nyse arca  inc  formerly the pacific exchange  in order to streamline administrative requirements and reduce expenses 
on december   we hired dr 
andre van as  md  md  to serve as our chief medical officer and senior vice president of clinical and regulatory affairs 
dr 
van as has extensive experience in drug development and regulatory approvals  including as executive director of the novartis team responsible for gaining regulatory approval of xolair  the first monoclonal antibody for the management of severe asthma 
on august  we transferred the listing of our common stock from the nasdaq capital market to the nasdaq global market under our ticker symbol  rprx 
on may   we changed our legal name from zonagen  inc to repros therapeutics inc to better reflect our focus on the reproductive and hormonal health market 
we are now an accelerated filer and are subject to additional financial regulatory requirements  including section of sarbanes oxley  which requires us to include in this annual report a report by management on our internal control over financial reporting and an accompanying auditor s report 
these additional activities have resulted in increased costs to us and will result in future increased costs as we maintain compliance with these requirements 
we have full time employees who utilize the services of contract research organizations  contract manufacturers and various consultants to assist us in performing clinical and regulatory services for the clinical development of our products 
we are substantially dependent on our various contract groups to adequately perform the activities required to obtain regulatory approval of our products 
the clinical development of pharmaceutical products is a complex undertaking  and many products that begin the clinical development process do not obtain regulatory approval 
the costs associated with our clinical trials may be impacted by a number of internal and external factors  including the number and complexity of clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval  the 
table of contents number of eligible patients necessary to complete our clinical trials and any difficulty in enrolling these patients  and the length of time to complete our clinical trials 
given the uncertainty of these potential costs  we recognize that the total costs we will incur for the clinical development of our product candidates may exceed our current estimates 
we do  however  expect these costs to increase substantially in future periods as we continue later stage clinical trials  initiate new clinical trials for additional indications and seek to obtain regulatory approvals 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have not generated any substantial revenue from commercial sale of our current product candidates 
we will not receive any revenue from commercial sales unless we complete the clinical trial process  obtain regulatory approval  and successfully commercialize one or more of our product candidates 
if we were to obtain regulatory approval of proellex  we will need to develop a long term  commercially viable source of bulk proellex to successfully commercialize the product candidate 
we cannot be certain when or if any net cash inflow from any of our current product candidates will commence 
we have experienced negative cash flows from operations since inception and have funded our activities to date primarily from equity financings and corporate collaborations 
we believe that our existing capital resources under our current operating plan will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least march  there can be no assurance that changes in our current strategic plans or other events will not result in accelerated or unexpected expenditures 
we may need to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities and or through partnerships to continue the clinical development of our products 
if we are not able to raise capital through the sale of equity securities  or cannot locate an alternative source of financing  the outcome would have a material adverse effect on us and the clinical development timeline of our product candidates 
if we are not able to raise adequate capital for our clinical development plans  then we will have to adjust our plans  which will delay the approval process of our product candidates 
our results of operations may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter  and depend  among other factors  on our ability to be successful in our clinical trials  the regulatory approval process in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions and the ability to complete new licenses and product development agreements 
the timing of our revenues may not match the timing of our associated product development expenses 
to date  research and development expenses have generally exceeded revenue in any particular period and or fiscal year 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
due to various tax regulations  including change in control provisions in the tax code  the value of our tax assets to us can be substantially diminished 
for additional information relating to our net operating loss carryforward  see note federal income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in conducting clinical trials for our product candidates  in research and development activities related to efforts to develop our products and from the associated administrative costs required to support those efforts 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete the transition from a development stage company to the successful introduction of commercially viable products 
our ability to achieve profitability will depend  among other things  on successfully completing the clinical development of our products in a reasonable time frame and at a reasonable cost  obtaining regulatory approvals  establishing marketing  sales and manufacturing capabilities or collaborative arrangements with others that possess such capabilities  our and our partners ability to realize value from our research and development programs through the commercialization of those products and raising sufficient funds to finance its activities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability or that profitability  if achieved  can be sustained 
see item business risk factors and note organization and operations of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
please see note  summary of significant accounting policies  for a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies 
a brief summary of our accounting policies is provided below 
investments trading securities management determines the appropriate classification of investments in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re evaluates such designation as of each subsequent balance sheet date 
securities for which we have the ability and intent to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity 
securities classified as trading securities are recorded at fair value 
gains and losses on trading securities  realized and unrealized  are included in earnings and are calculated using the specific identification method 
any other securities are classified as available for sale 
at december  all securities were classified as trading securities 
the fair value and cost basis including purchased premium for these securities was million and million at december  and  respectively 

table of contents our investments typically include corporate bonds and notes  euro dollar bonds  taxable auction securities and asset backed securities 
our policy is to require minimum credit ratings of a a and a p with maturities of up to three years 
the average life of the investment portfolio may not exceed months 
capitalized patent costs we capitalize the cost associated with building our patent library 
as of december  other assets consist of capitalized patent costs in the amount of  patent costs  which include legal and application costs related to the patent portfolio  are being amortized over years  or the lesser of the legal or the estimated economic life of the patent 
amortization of patent costs was  zero and  in  and  respectively 
of the  in capitalized patents   related to patents for proellex  which is being developed as an oral treatment for uterine fibroids and endometriosis and  related to androxal  which is being developed as an oral treatment for testosterone deficiency 
r d expense research and development  or r d  expenses include salaries and related employee expenses  contracted regulatory affairs activities  insurance coverage for clinical trials and prior product sales  contracted research and consulting fees  facility costs and internal research and development supplies 
we expense research and development costs in the period they are incurred 
these costs consist of direct and indirect costs associated with specific projects as well as fees paid to various entities that perform research on our behalf 
stock based compensation we have two stock based compensation plans at december   the non employee directors stock option plan  or director plan and the stock option plan  or plan 
we account for our stock based compensation plans under fasb statement no 
r  share based payments sfas r 
sfas r generally requires the recognition of the cost of employee services for share based compensation based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
under sfas r  we used the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options 
we follow the expanded guidance in sfas r for the development of our assumptions used as inputs to the black scholes model 
expected volatility is determined using historical volatilities based on historical stock prices for a period equal to the expected term 
the expected volatility assumption is adjusted if future volatility is expected to vary from historical experience 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and falls between the options vesting and contractual expiration dates 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield at the date of grant of a zero coupon us treasury bond whose maturity period equals the option s expected term 
use of estimates actual results could differ materially from our estimates 
the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows we have had losses since inception and  therefore  have not been subject to federal income taxes 
we have accumulated approximately million of research and development tax credits 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of net operating loss  or nol  carry forwards for federal income tax purposes 
additionally  approximately million of nols  and approximately  of research and development tax credits  expired in under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  an nol requires the recognition of a deferred tax asset 
however  a valuation allowance must be recorded for deferred tax assets whose recovery is deemed unlikely 
as we have incurred losses since inception  and there is no certainty of future revenues  our deferred tax assets have been reserved in full in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we review for the impairment of capitalized patent costs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the patent are less than its carrying amount 
the impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the patent cost as compared to its estimated fair value 
we have determined that our capitalized patent costs are not impaired as of december  the amount of compensation cost recognized in each period is based on our estimate of fair value of stock options granted on their grant date 
our estimate of fair value is derived from the black scholes option pricing model and that 
table of contents fair value is significantly influenced by the assumptions we have made regarding volatility and expected term  which are somewhat subjective 
while we believe our assumptions are reasonable and based on the best available information  changes in those assumptions could have a material impact on our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin establishes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this interpretation will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
earlier application is encouraged provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year including financial statements for an interim period within that fiscal year 
we are assessing sfas no 
and have not determined yet the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our results of operations or financial position 
in september  the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretative guidance on how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
there have been two common approaches used to quantify such errors 
under an income statement approach  the roll over method  the error is quantified as the amount by which the current year income statement is misstated 
alternatively  under a balance sheet approach  the iron curtain method  the error is quantified as the cumulative amount by which the current year balance sheet is misstated 
in sab  the sec established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of the company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this model is commonly referred to as a dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the roll over and iron curtain methods 
sab is effective for us as of january  the adoption of sab did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
this pronouncement permits entities to use the fair value method to measure certain financial assets and liabilities by electing an irrevocable option to use the fair value method at specified election dates 
after election of the option  subsequent changes in fair value would result in the recognition of unrealized gains or losses as period costs during the period the change occurred 
sfas no 
becomes effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after november   with early adoption permitted 
however  entities may not retroactively apply the provisions of sfas no 
to fiscal years preceding the date of adoption 
we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas no 
may have on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows

table of contents comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues for increased to  as compared to  for research and development grants for were  as compared to  for which amounts all related to our sbir grants 
interest income increased to  for as compared to  for the increase is primarily due to an increase in marketable securities as a result of the completion of our follow on public offering on february  in which we received approximately million in net proceeds  and an increase in interest rates

research and development expenses 
r d expenses increased to million in as compared to million in the increased expenses for is primarily due to increased spending in our clinical development programs million for proellex and million for androxal  partially offset by a decrease of  in costs associated with the write off of our patent portfolio related to our vaccine adjuvants  prostate cancer vaccines and hcg immuno contraceptive vaccine 
general and administrative expenses

we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million as of december  as compared to million as of december  the decrease in cash balance as of december  as compared to december  is primarily due to an increase in costs related to our clinical development programs for androxal and proellex and associated administrative costs 
excluding maturities and purchases of marketable securities  net cash of approximately million  million  and million was used in operating activities during   and  respectively 
the major uses of cash for operating activities during was to fund our clinical development programs and associated administrative costs of million  partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses

we will require substantial funds for research and development  including preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates  and to commence sales and marketing efforts if appropriate  if the fda or other regulatory approvals are obtained 
we believe that our existing capital resources under our current operating plan will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least march  there can be no assurance that changes in our current strategic plans or other events will not result in accelerated or unexpected expenditures
