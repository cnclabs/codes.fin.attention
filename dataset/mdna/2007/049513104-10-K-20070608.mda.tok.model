manufacturing during the quarter ended december   management reached a conclusion that the manufacturing capacity available at our existing facilities  combined with an increased emphasis on outsourcing certain products to foundry partners  offers sufficient available manufacturing capacity to meet our foreseeable forecasted demand 
if market demand for our products increases during  we believe that we will be able to substantially meet our production needs from our wafer fabrication facilities through at least the end of  however  capacity requirements may vary depending on  among other things  our rate of growth and our ability to increase production levels 
once we have fabricated the wafers  we test the individual circuits on them to identify those that do not function 
this saves us the cost of putting mechanical packages around circuits whose failure can be determined in advance 
after probe  we send all of our wafers to one of our independent assembly contractors  located in china  indonesia  japan  malaysia  the philippines  south korea  taiwan  or thailand where they are cut into individual chips and assembled into packages 
many of the finished products are given a final test at the assembly contractors although some are shipped back to our test facilities in the united states where we perform electrical testing and visual inspection before shipment to customers 
the raw materials and equipment we use to produce our integrated circuits are available from several suppliers and we are not dependent upon  any single source of supply 
however  some materials have been in short supply in the past and lead times on occasion lengthened  especially during semiconductor expansion cycles 
we currently manufacture approximately of our products at our wafer fabrication facilities located in colorado springs  colorado  heilbronn  germany  rousset  france  and north tyneside  united kingdom 
in december   we announced restructuring initiatives that included seeking to sell the north tyneside and heilbronn facilities to optimize our manufacturing operations 
we also announced  at that time  our intention to move to a fab lite manufacturing model with increased utilization of third party foundry capacity 
much of the million of manufacturing equipment purchased during was related to technology advancements 
it is anticipated that capital equipment purchases for  estimated at to million  will be focused on maintaining existing equipment  providing additional testing capacity and  to a limited extent  on developing advanced process technologies 
irving  texas  facility we acquired the irving  texas  wafer fabrication facility in january for million plus million in additional costs to retrofit the facility after the purchase 
following significant investment and effort to reach commercial production levels  we decided to close the facility in and it has been idle since then 
since  
table of contents we recorded various impairment charges  including million during the quarter ended december  in the quarter ended december   we performed an assessment of the market value for this facility based on management s estimate  which considered a current offer from a willing third party to purchase the facility  among other factors  in determining fair market value 
based on this assessment  an additional impairment charge of million was recorded 
on may   we announced the sale of our irving  texas  wafer fabrication facility for approximately million in cash 
the sale of the facility includes approximately acres of land  the fabrication facility building  and related offices  and remaining equipment 
an additional acres was retained by the company 
we do not expect to record a material gain or loss on the sale  following the impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of north tyneside  united kingdom  and heilbronn  germany  facilities in december  the company announced its decision to sell its wafer fabrication facilities in north tyneside  united kingdom  and heilbronn  germany 
it is expected these actions will increase manufacturing efficiencies by better utilizing remaining wafer fabrication facilities  while reducing future capital expenditure requirements 
the company has classified assets of the north tyneside site with a net book value of million excluding cash and inventory which will not be sold as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  following the announcement of intention to sell the facility in the fourth quarter of  the company assessed the fair market value of the facility compared to the carrying value recorded  including use of an independent appraisal  among other factors 
the fair value was determined using a market based valuation technique and as a result  the company recorded a net impairment charge of million in the quarter ended december   related to the write down of long lived assets to their fair values  less costs to dispose of the assets 
the charge included an asset write down of million for equipment and buildings  offset by a related currency translation adjustment associated with the assets  of million 
the company is actively marketing the facility through a top tier broker experienced in selling these types of properties 
we acquired the north tyneside  united kingdom  facility for million in september  which included an interest in acres of land and the fabrication buildings of approximately  square feet 
the company will have the right to acquire title to the land in for a nominal amount 
we sold acres in for million 
we previously recorded an asset impairment charge of million in the second quarter of to write down the carrying value of equipment in the fabrication facilities in north tyneside  united kingdom  to its estimated fair value 
the estimate of fair value was made by management based on a number of factors  including an independent appraisal 
the heilbronn  germany  facility did not meet the criteria for classification as held for sale as of december   due to uncertainties relating to the likelihood of completion of sale within the next twelve months 
assets of this facility remain classified as held and used 
after an assessment of expected future cash flows generated by the facility  we concluded that no impairment condition exists 
grenoble  france  facility in july  we completed the sale of our grenoble  france  subsidiary to ev technologies plc  a british corporation 
on august   the company received million in cash proceeds upon the close of the sale 
the cash proceeds from the sale were used for general working capital purposes 
environmental compliance we are subject to a variety of international  federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes 
increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of semiconductor operations 
although we have not experienced any material adverse effect on our operations from environmental regulations  any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement may impose the need for additional capital equipment or other requirements 
if for any reason we fail to control the use of  or to restrict adequately the discharge of  
table of contents hazardous substances under present or future regulations  we could be subject to substantial liability or our manufacturing operations could be suspended 
marketing and sales we generate our revenue by selling our products directly to original equipment manufacturers oems and indirectly to oems through distributors 
we market our products worldwide to a diverse base of oems serving primarily commercial markets 
in the united states and canada  we sell our products to large oem accounts primarily by using manufacturers representatives or through national and regional distributors 
our agreements with our representatives and distributors are generally terminable by either party on short notice  subject to local laws 
direct sales to oems as a percentage of net revenues for totaled while sales to distributors totaled of net revenues 
sales to us oems  as a percentage of net revenues totaled  and for  and  respectively 
sales to us distributors  as a percentage of net revenues  totaled  and for  and  respectively 
we support this sales network from our headquarters in san jose  california and through us regional offices in california  colorado  florida  illinois  massachusetts  michigan  minnesota  new jersey  north carolina  oregon  texas and washington 
we sell to customers outside of the us primarily by using international sales representatives and through distributors  who are managed from our foreign sales offices 
we maintain sales offices in china  denmark  finland  france  germany  hong kong  italy  japan  korea  singapore  south africa  spain  sweden  switzerland  taiwan and the united kingdom 
our sales outside the us were  and of net revenues in  and  respectively 
we expect revenues from our international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenues 
international sales are subject to a variety of risks  including those arising from currency fluctuations  tariffs  trade barriers  taxes  export license requirements and foreign government regulations 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we allow certain distributors  primarily based in the united states  rights of return and credits for price protection 
given the uncertainties associated with the levels of returns and other credits to these distributors based on contractual terms we defer recognition of revenue from sales to these distributors until they have resold our products 
sales to certain other primarily non us based distributors carry either no or very limited rights of return 
we have historically been able to estimate returns and other credits from these distributors and accordingly have historically recognized revenue from sales to these distributors upon shipment  with a related allowance for potential returns established at the time of our sale 
research and development we believe significant investment in research and development is vital to our success  growth and profitability  and we will continue to devote substantial resources  including management time  to this activity 
our primary objectives are to increase performance of our existing products  to develop new wafer processing and design technologies  and to draw upon these technologies to create new products 
if we are unable to design  develop  manufacture  market and sell new products successfully  our operating results will be harmed 
our new product development  process development  or marketing and sales efforts may not be successful  and as a result  our new products may not achieve expected functionality  market acceptance  or cost or pricing expectations 
during  and  we spent million  million and million  respectively  on research and development 
research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred 
we expect these expenditures will increase in the future as we continue to invest in new products and new processing technology 
competition we compete in markets that are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change  product obsolescence and price decline 
throughout our product line  we compete with a number of large semiconductor manufacturers  such as amd  cypress  freescale  fujitsu  hitachi  ibm  infineon  intel  lsi logic  microchip  philips  renesas  samsung  sharp  spansion  stmicroelectronics  texas instruments and 
table of contents toshiba 
some of these competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and management resources than we do 
as we have introduced new products  we are increasingly competing directly with these companies  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
we also compete with emerging companies that are attempting to sell products in specialized markets that our products address 
we compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our products  including their speed  density  power usage  reliability and specialty packaging alternatives  as well as on price and product availability 
during the last three years  we have experienced significant price competition in several business segments  especially in our nonvolatile memory segment for eprom  serial eeprom  and flash memory products  in our asic segment for smart cards  and in our microcontroller segment for commodity microcontrollers 
we expect continuing competitive pressures in our markets from existing competitors and new entrants  new technology and cyclical demand  which  among other factors  will likely maintain the recent trend of declining average selling prices for our products 
in addition to the factors described above  our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of other factors  including the following our success in designing and manufacturing new products that implement new technologies and processes our ability to offer integrated solutions using our advanced nonvolatile memory process with other technologies the rate at which customers incorporate our products into their systems product introductions by our competitors the number and nature of our competitors in a given market the incumbency of our competitors products  and general market and economic conditions 
many of these factors are outside of our control  and we may not be able to compete successfully in the future 
patents and licenses we maintain a portfolio of united states patents and we have patent applications on file with the us patent and trademark office 
we also operate an internal program to identify patentable developments and we file patent applications wherever necessary to protect our proprietary technologies 
however  because technology changes very rapidly in the semiconductor industry  we believe our continued success depends primarily on the technological and innovative skills of our employees and their abilities to rapidly commercialize discoveries 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions  which have on occasion resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
we have from time to time received  and may in the future receive  communications from third parties asserting patent or other intellectual property rights covering our products or processes 
in the past  we have received specific allegations from major companies alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by such companies 
in order to avoid the significant costs associated with our defense in litigation involving such claims  we may license the use of the technologies that are the subject of these claims from such companies and be required to make corresponding royalty payments  which may harm our operating results 
we have in the past been involved in intellectual property infringement lawsuits which harmed our operating results 
see item  legal proceedings 
although we intend to vigorously defend against any such lawsuits  we may not prevail given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in patent and intellectual property litigation 
moreover  the cost of defending against such litigation  in terms of management time and attention  legal fees and product delays  could be substantial  whatever the outcome 
if any patent or other intellectual property claims against us are successful  we may be prohibited from using the technologies subject to these claims  and if we are unable to obtain a license on acceptable terms  license a substitute technology  or design new technology to avoid infringement  our business and operating results may be significantly harmed 

table of contents we have several cross license agreements with other companies 
in the future  it may be necessary or advantageous for us to obtain additional patent licenses from existing or other parties  but these license agreements may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
employees at december   we employed approximately  employees compared to approximately  employees at december  our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees  particularly highly skilled design  process and test engineers necessary for the manufacture of existing products and the development of new products and processes 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and the loss of key employees  none of whom is subject to an employment agreement for a specified term or a post employment non competition agreement  could harm our business 
backlog we accept purchase orders for deliveries covering periods from one day up to approximately one year 
however  purchase orders can generally be revised or cancelled by the customer without penalty 
in addition  significant portions of our sales are ordered with short lead times  often referred to as turns business 
considering these practices and our experience  we do not believe the total of customer purchase orders outstanding backlog provides meaningful information that can be relied on to predict actual sales for future periods 
geographic areas in  of our sales were made to customers in the united states  to customers in asia  to customers in europe  and to customers in other regions 
we determine where our sales are made by the destination of our products when they are shipped 
as of december   we owned long lived assets in the united states amounting to million  in france  million  in germany  million and in the united kingdom  million  excluding assets held for sale in the united states and the united kingdom

risk factors the following trends  uncertainties and risks may impact the forward looking statements described elsewhere in this form k and in the documents incorporated herein by reference 
they could affect our actual results of operations  causing them to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements 
the results of our audit committee investigation into our historical stock option practices and resulting restatements may continue to have adverse effects on our financial results 
the audit committee investigation into our historical stock option practices and the resulting restatement of our historical financial statements have required us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting  legal  and other expenses 
the resulting restatements have had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have recorded additional non cash  stock based compensation expense of million for the periods from to excluding the impact of related payroll and income taxes 
see the explanatory note immediately preceding part i  item and note  restatements of consolidated financial statements  to notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion 
in addition  several lawsuits have been filed against us  our current directors and officers and certain of our former directors and officers relating to our historical stock option practices and related accounting 
see item legal proceedings  for a more detailed description of these proceedings 
we may become the subject of additional private or government actions regarding these matters in the future 
these actions are in the preliminary stages  and their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and the trading price for our securities 
litigation may be time consuming  expensive and disruptive to normal business operations  and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict 
the defense of these lawsuits will result in significant expenditures 
table of contents and the continued diversion of our management s time and attention from the operation of our business  which could impede our business 
all or a portion of any amount we may be required to pay to satisfy a judgment or settlement of any or all of these claims may not be covered by insurance 
judgment and estimates utilized by us in determining stock option grant dates and related adjustments may be subject to change due to subsequent sec guidance or other disclosure requirements 
in determining the restatement adjustments in connection with the stock option investigation  management used all reasonably available relevant information to form conclusions it believes are appropriate as to the most likely option granting actions that occurred  the dates when such actions occurred  and the determination of grant dates for financial accounting purposes based on when the requirements of the accounting standards were met 
we considered various alternatives throughout the course of the review and restatement  and we believe the approaches used were the most appropriate  and the choices of measurement dates used in our review of stock option grant accounting and restatement of our financial statements were reasonable and appropriate in our circumstances 
however  the sec may issue additional guidance on disclosure requirements related to the financial impact of past stock option grant measurement date errors that may require us to amend this filing or other filings with the sec to provide additional disclosures pursuant to such additional guidance 
any such circumstance could also lead to future delays in filing our subsequent sec reports and delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq global select market 
furthermore  if we are subject to adverse findings in any of these matters  we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us which could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors  which may result in volatility or a decline in our stock price 
our future operating results will be subject to quarterly variations based upon a wide variety of factors  many of which are not within our control 
these factors include the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our products  our transition to a fab lite strategy  our increased dependence on outside foundries and their ability to meet our volume  quality  and delivery objectives  particularly during times of increasing demand  inventory excesses or shortages due to reliance on third party manufacturers  our compliance with us trade and export laws and regulations  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  ability of independent assembly contractors to meet our volume  quality  and delivery objectives  success with disposal or restructuring activities  including disposition of our north tyneside and heilbronn facilities  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  possible delisting from nasdaq global select market  third party intellectual property infringement claims  the highly competitive nature of our markets  the pace of technological change  political and economic risks  natural disasters or terrorist acts  assessment of internal controls over financial reporting  
table of contents ability to meet our debt obligations  availability of additional financing  our ability to maintain good relationships with our customers  integration of new businesses or products  our compliance with international  federal and state export  environmental  privacy and other regulations  personnel changes  business interruptions  system integration disruptions  and changes in accounting rules  such as recording expenses for employee stock option grants 
any unfavorable changes in any of these factors could harm our operating results 
we believe that our future sales will depend substantially on the success of our new products 
our new products are generally incorporated into our customers products or systems at their design stage 
however  design wins may precede volume sales by a year or more 
we may not be successful in achieving design wins or design wins may not result in future revenues  which depend in large part on the success of the customer s end product or system 
the average selling price of each of our products usually declines as individual products mature and competitors enter the market 
to offset average selling price decreases  we rely primarily on reducing costs to manufacture those products  increasing unit sales to absorb fixed costs and introducing new  higher priced products which incorporate advanced features or integrated technologies to address new or emerging markets 
our operating results could be harmed if such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner 
from time to time  our quarterly revenues and operating results can become more dependent upon orders booked and shipped within a given quarter and  accordingly  our quarterly results can become less predictable and subject to greater variability 
in addition  our future success will depend in large part on the continued economic growth generally and of growth in various electronics industries that use semiconductors  including manufacturers of computers  telecommunications equipment  automotive electronics  industrial controls  consumer electronics  data networking equipment and military equipment 
the semiconductor industry has the ability to supply more products than demand requires 
our ability to return to profitability will depend heavily upon a better supply and demand balance within the semiconductor industry 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry creates fluctuations in our operating results 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical  characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
the industry has also experienced significant downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
the semiconductor industry faced severe business conditions with global semiconductor revenues for the industry declining to billion in  compared to revenues in the semiconductor industry began to turn around in with global semiconductor sales increasing modestly by to billion 
global semiconductor sales increased to billion in  to billion in  to billion in and to billion in atmel s operating results have been harmed by industry wide fluctuations in the demand for semiconductors  which resulted in under utilization of our manufacturing capacity and declining gross margins 
in the past we have recorded significant charges to recognize impairment in the value of our manufacturing equipment  the cost to reduce workforce  and other restructuring costs 
our business may be harmed in the future not only by cyclical conditions in the semiconductor industry as a whole but also by slower growth in any of the markets served by our products 

table of contents we could experience disruption of our business as we transition to a fab lite strategy 
as part of our fab lite strategy  we have reduced and plan to further reduce the number of our owned manufacturing facilities 
in december  we sold our nantes  france fabrication facility and the related foundry activities  to xybybus sas 
in july  we sold our grenoble  france subsidiary including the fabrication facility in grenoble to ev technologies plc 
in december  we announced the planned sale of our north tyneside  united kingdom and heilbronn  germany wafer fabrication facilities 
on may   we announced the sale of our irving  texas  wafer fabrication facility 
as a result of the sale or planned sale of such fabrication facilities  we will be increasingly relying on the utilization of third party foundry manufacturing and assembly and test capacity 
as part of such transition we must expand our foundry relationships by entering into new agreements with such third party foundries 
if such agreements are not completed on a timely basis  manufacturing of certain of our products could be disrupted  which would harm our business 
in addition  difficulties in production yields can often occur when transitioning to a new third party manufacturer 
if such foundries fail to deliver quality products and components on a timely basis  our business could be harmed 
implementation of our new fab lite strategy will expose us to the following risks reduced control over delivery schedules and product costs  manufacturing costs that are higher than anticipated  inability of our manufacturing subcontractors to develop manufacturing methods appropriate for our products and their unwillingness to devote adequate capacity to produce our products  possible abandonment of fabrication processes by our manufacturing subcontractors for products that are strategically important to us  decline in product quality and reliability  inability to maintain continuing relationships with our suppliers  restricted ability to meet customer demand when faced with product shortages  and increased opportunities for potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
if any of the above risks are realized  we could experience an interruption in our supply chain or an increase in costs  which could delay or decrease our revenue or harm our business 
as we increase dependence on outside foundries  such foundries may not have adequate capacity to fulfill our needs and may not meet our quality and delivery objectives or may abandon fabrication processes that we require 
we expect to increase our utilization of outside foundries to expand our capacity in the future  especially for high volume commodity type products and certain aggressive technology asic products 
reliance on outside foundries to fabricate wafers involves significant risks  including reduced control over quality and delivery schedules  a potential lack of capacity  and a risk the subcontractor may abandon the fabrication processes we need from a strategic standpoint  even if the process is not economically viable 
we hope to mitigate these risks with a strategy of qualifying multiple subcontractors 
however  there can be no guarantee that any strategy will eliminate these risks 
additionally  since most of such outside foundries are located in foreign countries  we are subject to certain risks generally associated with contracting with foreign manufacturers  including currency exchange fluctuations  political and economic instability  trade restrictions and changes in tariff and freight rates 
accordingly  we may experience problems in timelines and the adequacy or quality of product deliveries  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents increasing dependence on third party manufacturers could harm our business in times of increasing demand in our industry 
we currently manufacture our products at our facilities in colorado springs  colorado  heilbronn  germany  rousset  france  and north tyneside  united kingdom 
in december  we announced our plan to sell the heilbronn and north tyneside facilities to optimize our manufacturing operations as part of our adoption of a fab lite strategy 
in order to shift from a manufacturing based business model to an outsourcing business model  we will need to substantially expand our foundry relationships 
the terms on which we will be able to obtain wafer production for our products  and the timing and volume of such production will be substantially dependent on agreements to be negotiated with semiconductor foundries 
we cannot be certain that the agreements we reach with such foundries will be on terms reasonable to us 
therefore  any agreements reached with semiconductor foundries may be short term and possibly non renewable  and hence provide less certainty regarding the supply and pricing of wafers for our products 
during economic upturns in the semiconductor industry we will not be able to guarantee that our third party foundries will be able to increase manufacturing capacity to a level that meets demand for our products  which would prevent us from meeting increased customer demand and harm our business 
also during times of increased demand for our products  if such foundries are able to meet such demand  it may be at higher wafer prices  which would reduce our gross margins on such products or require us to offset the increased price by increasing prices for our customers  either of which would harm our business and operating results 
as a result of increased dependence on third party manufacturers  we may incur inventory excesses or shortages as we increase our reliance on third party manufacturers and subcontractors  we acknowledge that the lead times required by such foundries have increased in recent years and is likely to increase in the future 
however  market conditions and intense competition in the semiconductor industry require that we be prepared to ship products to our customers with much shorter lead times 
consequently  to have product inventory to meet potential customer purchase orders  we may have to place purchase orders for wafers from our manufacturers in advance of having firm purchase orders from our customers  which from time to time will cause us to have an excess or shortage of wafers for a particular product 
if we do not have sufficient demand for our products and cannot cancel our current and future commitments without material impact  we may experience excess inventory  which will result in a write off affecting gross margin and results of operations 
if we cancel a purchase order  we may have to pay cancellation penalties based on the status of work in process or the proximity of the cancellation to the delivery date 
as a result of the long lead time for manufacturing wafers and the increase in just in time ordering by customers  semiconductor companies from time to time may need to record additional expense for the write down of excess inventory 
significant write downs of excess inventory could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
conversely  failure to order sufficient wafers would cause us to miss revenue opportunities and  if significant  could impact sales by our customers  which could adversely affect our customer relationships and thereby materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade and export controls  the violation of which could adversely affect our operations 
for products and technology exported from the us or otherwise subject to us jurisdiction  we are subject to us laws and regulations governing international trade and exports  including  but not limited to the international traffic in arms regulations itar  the export administration regulations ear and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and destinations administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac  us department of the treasury 
we have recently discovered shortcomings in our export compliance procedures 
we are currently analyzing product shipments and technology transfers  working with us government officials to ensure compliance with applicable us export laws and regulations  and developing an enhanced export compliance system 
a determination by the us government that we have failed to comply with one or more of these export 
table of contents controls or trade sanctions could result in civil or criminal penalties  including the imposition of significant fines  denial of export privileges  and debarment from us participation in government contracts 
any one or more of these sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 
because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 
our primary exposure relates to operating expenses in europe  where a significant amount of our manufacturing is located 
we have in the past entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency assets and liabilities 
in addition  we have periodically hedged certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
we do not plan to hedge against either of these risks in the foreseeable future  but if we should  our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful  resulting in an adverse impact on our net income 
in addition  our net income may be subject to greater foreign currency gains and losses on certain foreign currency assets and liabilities during times in which we have not entered into foreign exchange forward contracts 
revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies could adversely impact our operating results with changes in these foreign currencies against the dollar 
when we take an order denominated in a foreign currency we may receive fewer dollars than initially anticipated if that local currency weakens against the dollar before we collect our funds 
conversely  when we incur a cost denominated in a foreign currency we may pay more dollars than initially anticipated if that local currency strengthens against the dollar before we pay the costs 
in addition to reducing revenues or increasing our costs  this risk can negatively affect our operating results 
in europe  where our significant operations have costs denominated in european currencies  a negative impact on expenses can be partially offset by a positive impact on revenues 
sales denominated in european currencies  and yen as a percentage of net revenues were and in  and in and and in  respectively 
operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies as a percentage of total operating expenses  primarily the euro  were in  in and in we also face the risk that our accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies could be devalued if such foreign currencies weaken quickly and significantly against the dollar 
conversely we face the risk that our accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies could increase in value if such foreign currencies strengthen against the dollar 
we also face the risk that our accounts receivables denominated in foreign currencies will be devalued if such foreign currencies weaken quickly and significantly against the dollar 
approximately and of our accounts receivable are denominated in foreign currency as of december  and  respectively 
we also face the risk that our accounts payable and debt obligations denominated in foreign currencies will increase if such foreign currencies strengthen quickly and significantly against the dollar 
approximately and of our accounts payable were denominated in foreign currency as of december  and  respectively 
approximately of our debt obligations were denominated in foreign currency as of december  and we depend on independent assembly contractors which may not have adequate capacity to fulfill our needs and which may not meet our quality and delivery objectives 
we currently manufacture a majority of the wafers for our products at our fabrication facilities  and the wafers are then sorted and tested at our facilities 
after wafer testing  we ship the wafers to one of our independent assembly contractors located in china  hong kong  indonesia  japan  malaysia  the philippines  south korea  taiwan or thailand where the wafers are separated into die  packaged and  in some cases  tested 
our reliance on 
table of contents independent contractors to assemble  package and test our products involves significant risks  including reduced control over quality and delivery schedules  the potential lack of adequate capacity and discontinuance or phase out of the contractors assembly processes 
these independent contractors may not continue to assemble  package and test our products for a variety of reasons 
moreover  because our assembly contractors are located in foreign countries  we are subject to certain risks generally associated with contracting with foreign suppliers  including currency exchange fluctuations  political and economic instability  trade restrictions  including export controls  and changes in tariff and freight rates 
accordingly  we may experience problems in timelines and the adequacy or quality of product deliveries  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we face risks associated with disposal or restructuring activities 
as part of our fab lite strategy  in december  we announced plans to sell our heilbronn  germany  and north tyneside  united kingdom  manufacturing facilities 
however  reducing our wafer fabrication capacity involves significant potential costs and delays  particularly in europe  where the extensive statutory protection of employees imposes substantial costs and delays on their employers when the market requires downsizing 
such costs and delays include compensation to employees and local government agencies  requirements and approvals of governmental and judicial bodies  and losses of or requirement to repay governmental subsidies 
we may experience labor union objections or other difficulties while implementing a downsizing 
any such difficulties that we experience would harm our business and operating results  either by deterring needed downsizing or by the additional costs of accomplishing it in europe relative to america or asia 
we continue to evaluate the existing restructuring and asset impairment reserves related to previously implemented restructuring plans 
as a result  there may be additional restructuring charges or reversals of previously established reserves 
however  we may incur additional restructuring and asset impairment charges in connection with any restructuring plans adopted in the future 
any such restructuring or asset impairment charges recorded in the future could significantly harm our business and operating results 
see notes and to notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
if we are unable to implement new manufacturing technologies or fail to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields  our business would be harmed 
whether demand for semiconductors is rising or falling  we are constantly required by competitive pressures in the industry to successfully implement new manufacturing technologies in order to reduce the geometries of our semiconductors and produce more integrated circuits per wafer 
we are developing processes that support effective feature sizes as small as microns  and we are studying how to implement advanced manufacturing processes with even smaller feature sizes such as microns 
fabrication of our integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process  requiring production in a tightly controlled  clean environment 
minute impurities  difficulties in the fabrication process  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
whether through the use of our foundries or third party manufacturers  we may experience problems in achieving acceptable yields in the manufacture of wafers  particularly during a transition in the manufacturing process technology for our products 
we have previously experienced production delays and yield difficulties in connection with earlier expansions of our wafer fabrication capacity or transitions in manufacturing process technology 
production delays or difficulties in achieving acceptable yields at any of our fabrication facilities or at the fabrication facilities of our third party manufacturers could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
we may not be able to obtain the additional cash from operations or external financing necessary to fund the implementation of new manufacturing technologies 
we have not been in compliance with sec reporting requirements and nasdaq listing requirements 
if we are unable to attain compliance with  or thereafter remain in compliance with sec reporting requirements and nasdaq listing 
table of contents requirements  there may be a material adverse effect on our business and our stockholders 
as a consequence of the audit committee investigation into our historical stock option practices and resulting restatements of our financial statements  we have not been able to file our periodic reports with the sec on a timely basis and continue to face the possibility of delisting of our stock from the nasdaq global select market 
we have now filed this annual report on form k for the year ended december   and our quarterly reports on form q for the quarters ended june  and september  we were not able to file our quarterly report for the quarter ended march  on a timely basis 
see the explanatory note immediately preceding part i  item and note  restatements of consolidated financial statements  to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion 
until we have returned to full compliance with sec reporting requirements and nasdaq listing requirements  the possibility of a nasdaq delisting exists 
if this happens  the price of our stock and the ability of our stockholders to trade in our stock would be adversely affected 
in addition  we would be subject to a number of restrictions regarding the registration of our stock under federal securities laws  and we would not be able to allow our employees to exercise their outstanding options  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
as a result of the delayed filing of our quarterly report on form q for the quarters ended june   september   and march   as well as this form k  we will be ineligible to register our securities on form s for sale by us or resale by others until one year from the date the last delinquent filing is made 
we may use form s to raise capital or complete acquisitions  but doing so could increase transaction costs and adversely impact our ability to raise capital or complete acquisitions of other companies in a timely manner 
we may face third party intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in loss of significant rights 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions  which on occasion have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
we have from time to time received  and may in the future receive  communications from third parties asserting patent or other intellectual property rights covering our products or processes 
in the past  we have received specific allegations from major companies alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by such companies 
in order to avoid the significant costs associated with our defense in litigation involving such claims  we may license the use of the technologies that are the subject of these claims from such companies and be required to make corresponding royalty payments  which may harm our operating results 
we have in the past been involved in intellectual property infringement lawsuits  which harmed our operating results and are currently involved in intellectual property infringement lawsuits  which may harm our future operating results 
we are currently involved in several intellectual property infringement lawsuits 
although we intend to vigorously defend against any such lawsuits  we may not prevail given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in patent and intellectual property litigation 
moreover  the cost of defending against such litigation  in terms of management time and attention  legal fees and product delays  could be substantial  whatever the outcome 
if any patent or other intellectual property claims against us are successful  we may be prohibited from using the technologies subject to these claims  and if we are unable to obtain a license on acceptable terms  license a substitute technology  or design new technology to avoid infringement  our business and operating results may be significantly harmed 
we have several cross license agreements with other companies 
in the future  it may be necessary or advantageous for us to obtain additional patent licenses from existing or other parties  but these license agreements may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
our markets are highly competitive  and if we do not compete effectively  we may suffer price reductions  reduced revenues  reduced gross margins  and loss of market share 
we compete in markets that are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change  product obsolescence and price decline 
throughout our product line  we compete with a number of large 
table of contents semiconductor manufacturers  such as amd  cypress  freescale  fujitsu  hitachi  ibm  infineon  intel  lsi logic  microchip  philips  renesas  samsung  sharp  spansion  stmicroelectronics  texas instruments and toshiba 
some of these competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and management resources than we do 
as we have introduced new products we are increasingly competing directly with these companies  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
we also compete with emerging companies that are attempting to sell products in specialized markets that our products address 
we compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our products  including their speed  density  power usage  reliability and specialty packaging alternatives  as well as on price and product availability 
during the last several years  we have experienced significant price competition in several business segments  especially in our nonvolatile memory segment for eprom  serial eeprom  and flash memory products  as well as in our commodity microcontrollers and smart cards 
we expect continuing competitive pressures in our markets from existing competitors and new entrants  new technology and cyclical demand  which  among other factors  will likely maintain the recent trend of declining average selling prices for our products 
in addition to the factors described above  our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including the following our success in designing and manufacturing new products that implement new technologies and processes  our ability to offer integrated solutions using our advanced nonvolatile memory process with other technologies  the rate at which customers incorporate our products into their systems  product introductions by our competitors  the number and nature of our competitors in a given market  the incumbency of our competitors at potential new customers  our ability to minimize production costs by outsourcing our manufacturing  assembly and testing functions  and general market and economic conditions 
many of these factors are outside of our control  and we may not be able to compete successfully in the future 
we may be subject to adverse findings from additional audit committee investigations into improper business practices 
in addition to the investigation into stock option granting practices  the audit committee of atmel s board of directors  with the assistance of independent legal counsel and forensic accountants  conducted independent investigations into a certain proposed investments in high yield securities that were being contemplated by our former chief executive officer during the period from to and bank transfers related thereto  and b alleged payments from certain of our customers to employees at one of our asian subsidiaries 
the audit committee has completed its investigations  including its review of the impact on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   and prior periods  and concluded that there was no impact on such consolidated financial statements 
however  we can give no assurances that subsequent information will not be discovered that may cause the audit committee to reopen such reviews 
in addition  government agencies  including local authorities in asia  may initiate their own review into these and related matters 
at this time  we cannot predict the outcome of such reviews  if any 
an adverse finding in any of these matters could lead to future delays in filing our subsequent sec reports and delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq global select market  and result in additional management time being diverted and additional legal and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we face various risks associated with a potential change of control of our board of directors 
pursuant to the order of the delaware chancery court  on may   atmel held a special meeting of stockholders to consider and vote on a proposal by george perlegos  our former chairman  president and ceo  to remove five members of our board of directors and to replace them with five persons nominated by mr 
perlegos 
on june   following final tabulation of votes and certification by ivs associates  inc  the independent inspector of elections for the special meeting  we announced that stockholders had rejected the proposal considered at the special meeting 
prior to the special meeting  atmel also received a notice from mr 
perlegos indicating his intent to nominate eight persons for election to our board of directors at our annual meeting of stockholders to be held on july  on june   atmel received notice that mr 
perlegos will not solicit proxies from atmel s shareholders as to any issue  including the makeup of atmel s board of directors  in connection with atmel s annual meeting to be held in july there can be no assurance that atmel will not face another proxy contest in the future  which would be time consuming  expensive and disruptive to normal business operations 
we must keep pace with technological change to remain competitive 
the average selling prices of our products historically have decreased over the products lives and are expected to continue to do so 
as a result  our future success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products which compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements 
we are continually designing and commercializing new and improved products to maintain our competitive position 
these new products typically are more technologically complex than their predecessors  and thus have increased potential for delays in their introduction 
the success of new product introductions is dependent upon several factors  including timely completion and introduction of new product designs  achievement of acceptable fabrication yields and market acceptance 
our development of new products and our customers decision to design them into their systems can take as long as three years  depending upon the complexity of the device and the application 
accordingly  new product development requires a long term forecast of market trends and customer needs  and the successful introduction of our products may be adversely affected by competing products or by technologies serving the markets addressed by our products 
our qualification process involves multiple cycles of testing and improving a product s functionality to ensure that our products operate in accordance with design specifications 
if we experience delays in the introduction of new products  our future operating results could be harmed 
in addition  new product introductions frequently depend on our development and implementation of new process technologies  and our future growth will depend in part upon the successful development and market acceptance of these process technologies 
our integrated solution products require more technically sophisticated sales and marketing personnel to market these products successfully to customers 
we are developing new products with smaller feature sizes  the fabrication of which will be substantially more complex than fabrication of our current products 
if we are unable to design  develop  manufacture  market and sell new products successfully  our operating results will be harmed 
our new product development  process development  or marketing and sales efforts may not be successful  our new products may not achieve market acceptance  and price expectations for our new products may not be achieved  any of which could harm our business 
our operating results are highly dependent on our international sales and operations  which exposes us to various political and economic risks 
sales to customers outside the us accounted for  and of net revenues in  and  respectively 
we expect that revenues derived from international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net revenues 
international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks  including greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property  
table of contents reduced flexibility and increased cost of staffing adjustments  particularly in france and germany  longer collection cycles  potential unexpected changes in regulatory practices  including export license requirements  trade barriers  tariffs and tax laws  environmental and privacy regulations  and general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets 
further  we purchase a significant portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers  and we incur labor and other operating costs in foreign currencies  particularly at our french  german and uk manufacturing facilities 
as a result  our costs will fluctuate along with the currencies and general economic conditions in the countries in which we do business  which could harm our operating results 
approximately  and of our net revenues in  and  respectively  were denominated in us dollars 
approximately  and of net revenues were generated in asia in  and  respectively 
our operations and financial results could be harmed by natural disasters or terrorist acts 
since the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon in  certain insurance coverage has either been reduced or made subject to additional conditions by our insurance carriers  and we have not been able to maintain all necessary insurance coverage at reasonable cost 
instead  we have relied to a greater degree on self insurance 
for example  we now self insure property losses up to million per event 
our headquarters  some of our manufacturing facilities  the manufacturing facilities of third party foundries and some of our major vendors and customers facilities are located near major earthquake faults and in potential terrorist target areas 
if a major earthquake or other disaster or a terrorist act impacts us and insurance coverage is unavailable for any reason  we may need to spend significant amounts to repair or replace our facilities and equipment  we may suffer a temporary halt in our ability to manufacture and transport product and we could suffer damages of an amount sufficient to harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a lack of effective internal control over financial reporting could result in an inability to accurately report our financial results  which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our business and operating results could be harmed 
we have in the past discovered  and may in the future discover  deficiencies in our internal controls 
evaluations of the effectiveness of our internal controls in the future may lead our management to determine that internal control over financial reporting is no longer effective 
such conclusions may result from our failure to implement controls for changes in our business  or deterioration in the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures 
a failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting  including a failure to implement effective new controls to address changes in our business could result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations 
this  in turn  could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
our debt levels could harm our ability to obtain additional financing  and our ability to meet our debt obligations will be dependent upon our future performance 
as of december   our total debt was million compared to million at december  the decrease is primarily a result of the redemption of the zero coupon convertible notes  due on may   substantially all of the convertible notes outstanding were redeemed for million 
the remaining balance 
table of contents of million was called by the company in june our long term debt less current portion to equity ratio was and at december  and  respectively 
increases in our debt to equity ratio could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
certain of our debt facilities contain terms that subject us to financial and other covenants 
we were not in compliance with covenants requiring timely filing of us gaap financial statements as of december   and  as a result  requested waivers from our lenders to avoid default under these facilities 
waivers were received from all but one lender  and as a result of not receiving a waiver from that lender  we reclassified million of non current liabilities related to assets held for sale to current liabilities related to assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  from time to time our ability to meet our debt obligations will depend upon our ability to raise additional financing and on our future performance and ability to generate substantial cash flow from operations  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
if we are unable to meet debt obligations or otherwise are obliged to repay any debt prior to its due date  our available cash would be depleted  perhaps seriously  and our ability to fund operations harmed 
in addition  our ability to service long term debt in the us or to obtain cash for other needs from our foreign subsidiaries may be structurally impeded  as a substantial portion of our operations are conducted through our foreign subsidiaries 
our cash flow and ability to service debt are partially dependent upon the liquidity and earnings of our subsidiaries as well as the distribution of those earnings  or repayment of loans or other payments of funds by those subsidiaries  to the us parent corporation 
these foreign subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and may have limited or no obligation  contingent or otherwise  to pay any amounts to us  whether by dividends  distributions  loans or any other form 
we may need to raise additional capital that may not be available 
although in july we sold our grenoble  france  subsidiary and in december we announced our plan to sell the heilbronn and north tyneside fabrication facilities  we intend to continue to make capital investments to support new products and manufacturing processes that achieve manufacturing cost reductions and improved yields 
currently  we expect our total capital expenditures to be to million 
we may seek additional equity or debt financing to fund operations or to fund other projects 
the timing and amount of such capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including demand for products  product mix  changes in semiconductor industry conditions and competitive factors 
additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or  if available  may not be available on satisfactory terms 
problems that we experience with key customers or distributors may harm our business 
our ability to maintain close  satisfactory relationships with large customers is important to our business 
a reduction  delay  or cancellation of orders from our large customers would harm our business 
the loss of one or more of our key customers  or reduced orders by any of our key customers  could harm our business and results of operations 
moreover  our customers may vary order levels significantly from period to period  and customers may not continue to place orders with us in the future at the same levels as in prior periods 
we sell many of our products through distributors 
our distributors could experience financial difficulties or otherwise reduce or discontinue sales of our products 
our distributors could commence or increase sales of our competitors products 
in any of these cases  our business could be harmed 
in addition  in the short term our revenues in asia may decrease as we optimize our distributor base in asia 
it may take time for us to identify financially viable distributors and help them develop quality support services 
this process may result in short term revenue loss  particularly in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal there can be no assurances that we will be able to manage this optimization process in an efficient and timely manner 

table of contents we are not protected by long term contracts with our customers 
we do not typically enter into long term contracts with our customers  and we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our customers 
when we do enter into a long term contract  the contract is generally terminable at the convenience of the customer 
in the event of an early termination by one of our major customers  it is unlikely that we will be able to rapidly replace that revenue source  which would harm our financial results 
our failure to successfully integrate businesses or products we have acquired could disrupt or harm our ongoing business 
we have from time to time acquired  and may in the future acquire additional  complementary businesses  facilities  products and technologies 
achieving the anticipated benefits of an acquisition depends  in part  upon whether the integration of the acquired business  products or technology is accomplished in an efficient and effective manner 
moreover  successful acquisitions in the semiconductor industry may be more difficult to accomplish than in other industries because such acquisitions require  among other things  integration of product offerings  manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts 
the difficulties of such integration may be increased by the need to coordinate geographically separated organizations  the complexity of the technologies being integrated  and the necessity of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining two different corporate cultures 
the integration of operations following an acquisition requires the dedication of management resources that may distract attention from the day to day business  and may disrupt key research and development  marketing or sales efforts 
the inability of management to successfully integrate any future acquisition could harm our business 
furthermore  products acquired in connection with acquisitions may not gain acceptance in our markets  and we may not achieve the anticipated or desired benefits of such transactions 
we are subject to environmental regulations  which could impose unanticipated requirements on our business in the future 
any failure to comply with current or future environmental regulations may subject us to liability or suspension of our manufacturing operations 
we are subject to a variety of international  federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes 
increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of semiconductor operations 
although we have not experienced any material adverse effect on our operations from environmental regulations  any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement may impose the need for additional capital equipment or other requirements 
if for any reason we fail to control the use of  or to restrict adequately the discharge of  hazardous substances under present or future regulations  we could be subject to substantial liability or our manufacturing operations could be suspended 
we also could face significant costs and liabilities in connection with product take back legislation 
we record a liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs when we consider the costs to be probable and the amount of the costs can be reasonably estimated 
the eu has enacted the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive  which makes producers of electrical goods  including computers and printers  financially responsible for specified collection  recycling  treatment and disposal of past and future covered products 
the deadline for the individual member states of the eu to enact the directive in their respective countries was august  such legislation  together with the directive  the weee legislation 
producers participating in the market became financially responsible for implementing these responsibilities beginning in august our potential liability resulting from the weee legislation may be substantial 
similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions  including in the united states  canada  mexico  china and japan  the cumulative impact of which could be significant 

table of contents we depend on certain key personnel  and the loss of any key personnel may seriously harm our business 
our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and management personnel  and on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees  particularly those highly skilled design  process and test engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and in the development of new products and processes 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and the loss of key employees  none of whom is subject to an employment agreement for a specified term or a post employment noncompetition agreement  could harm our business 
business interruptions could harm our business 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control 
we do not have a detailed disaster recovery plan 
in addition  business interruption insurance may not be enough to compensate us for losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of business interruptions could significantly harm our business 
system integration disruptions could harm our business 
we periodically make enhancements to our integrated financial and supply chain management systems 
this process is complex  time consuming and expensive 
operational disruptions during the course of this process or delays in the implementation of these enhancements could impact our operations 
our ability to forecast sales demand  ship products  manage our product inventory and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis could be impaired due to these enhancements 
provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws and preferred shares rights agreement may have anti takeover effects 
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  voting rights  preferences and privileges and restrictions of those shares without the approval of our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be harmed by  the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may delay  defer or prevent a change in control  by making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our stock 
in addition  the issuance of preferred stock could have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 
we have no present plans to issue shares of preferred stock 
we also have a preferred shares rights agreement with equiserve trust company  na  as rights agent  dated as of september   amended and restated on october  and amended as of november   which gives our stockholders certain rights that would likely delay  defer or prevent a change of control of atmel in a transaction not approved by our board of directors 
our stock price has fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by factors such as the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  technological innovations by us or our competitors  quarterly variations in our results of operations  changes in earnings estimates by market analysts and general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries 
statements or changes in opinions  ratings  or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the market in which we do business or relating to us specifically could result in an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of our stock 
in addition  in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have had a substantial effect on the market prices for many high technology companies  often unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies

accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 and supersedes our previous accounting under apb no 
we adopted sfas no

and further amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 

under the intrinsic value method  stock based compensation expense was recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for stock based awards granted to employees when the exercise price of these awards was less than the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant 
loss from continuing operations in was increased by stock based compensation expense of million calculated in accordance with sfas no

our foreign pension plans are unfunded  and any requirement to fund these plans in the future could negatively impact our cash position and operating capital 
we sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all our french and german employees 
plan benefits are managed in accordance with local statutory requirements 
benefits are based on years of service and employee compensation levels 
long term pension benefits payable totaled million at december  and the plans are non funded  in compliance with local statutory regulations  and we have no immediate intention of funding these plans 
benefits are paid when amounts become due  commencing when participants retire 
cash funding for benefits to be paid for is expected to be approximately million 
should legislative regulations require complete or partial funding of these plans in the future  it could negatively impact our cash position and operating capital

item legal proceedings atmel currently is party to various legal proceedings 
while management currently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or overall trends in results of operations  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties 
if an unfavorable ruling were to occur  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations  cash flows and financial position of atmel 
the estimate of the potential impact on the company s financial position or overall results of operations or cash flows for the legal proceedings described below could change in the future 
the company has accrued for all losses related to litigation that the company considers probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
on august   george perlegos  atmel s former president and chief executive officer  and gust perlegos  atmel s former executive vice president  office of the president  filed three actions in delaware chancery court against atmel and some of its officers and directors under sections  and of the delaware general corporation law 
in the section action  plaintiffs alleged that on august   the board 
table of contents of directors wrongfully cancelled or rescinded a call for a special meeting of atmel s stockholders  and sought an order requiring the holding of the special meeting of stockholders 
in the section action  plaintiffs alleged that their termination was the product of an invalidly noticed board meeting and improperly constituted committees acting with gross negligence and in bad faith 
they further alleged that there was no basis in law or fact to remove them from their positions for cause  and sought an order declaring that they continue in their positions as president and chief executive officer  and executive vice president  office of the president  respectively 
for both actions  plaintiffs sought costs  reasonable attorneys fees and any other appropriate relief 
the section action  which sought access to corporate records  was dismissed in regarding the delaware actions  a trial was held in october  the court held argument in december  issued a memorandum opinion in february  and granted a final order on march  regarding the section action  the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs with regards to calling a special meeting of stockholders 
pursuant to the order of the delaware chancery court  the company held a special meeting of stockholders on may  to consider and vote on a proposal by george perlegos  our former chairman  president and chief executive officer  to remove five members of our board of directors and to replace them with five persons nominated by mr

in august  the company received a letter from the sec making an informal inquiry and request for information on the same subject matters 
in august  atmel received information document requests from the internal revenue service irs regarding atmel s investigation into misuse of corporate travel funds and investigation into backdating of stock options 
we are cooperating fully with doj  sec and irs inquiries and intend to continue to do so 
these inquiries likely will require us to expend significant management time and incur significant legal and other expenses  and could result in civil and criminal actions seeking  among other things  injunctions against atmel and the payment of significant fines and penalties by atmel  which may adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows 
we cannot predict how long it will take or how much more time and resources we will have to expend to resolve these government inquiries  nor can we predict the outcome of these inquiries 
on november   george perlegos filed an administrative complaint against atmel with the federal occupational safety health administration osha asserting that he was wrongfully terminated by atmel s board of directors in violation of the sarbanes oxley act
