words or phrases such as anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  plans  predicts  projects  will likely result  will continue and similar expressions are intended to identify certain of these forward looking statements 
however  these words are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements 
in addition  any statements that refer to expectations  projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
puget energy s and pse s actual results could differ materially from results that may be anticipated by such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the section entitled forward looking statements included elsewhere in this report 
except as required by law  neither puget energy nor pse undertakes an obligation to revise any forward looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may subsequently arise 
readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in this report and in puget energy s and pse s other reports filed with the united states securities and exchange commission that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect puget energy s and pse s business  prospects and results of operations 
overview puget energy  inc puget energy is an energy services holding company and all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiary puget sound energy pse  a regulated electric and gas utility company 
puget energy owned a interest in infrastrux  a utility construction and services company  until it was sold to an affiliate of tenaska power fund  lp tenaska on may  after repayment of debt  adjustments for working capital  transaction costs and distributions to minority interests  puget energy received million for its interest in infrastrux in the second quarter the sale resulted in an after tax gain of million for the twelve months ended december  the million net proceeds puget energy received from the sale of infrastrux were used to support pse through an equity contribution of million and a loan of million 
in addition  puget energy established a charitable foundation  puget sound energy foundation  in the second quarter with a contribution of million from the net proceeds from the sale of infrastrux along with investment income of million on the cash proceeds and a federal income tax benefit of million from funding the puget sound energy foundation 
puget sound energy pse generates revenues from the sale of electric and gas services  mainly to residential and commercial customers within washington state 
pse s operating revenues and associated expenses are not generated evenly during the year 
variations in energy usage by consumers occur from season to season and from month to month within a season  primarily as a result of weather conditions 
pse normally experiences its highest retail energy sales and subsequently higher power costs during the winter heating season in the first and fourth quarters of the year and its lowest sales in the third quarter of the year 
varying wholesale electric prices and the amount of hydroelectric energy supplies available to pse also make quarter to quarter comparisons difficult 
as a regulated utility company  pse is subject to federal energy regulatory commission ferc and washington utilities and transportation commission washington commission regulation which may impact a large array of business activities  including limitation of future rate increases  directed accounting requirements that may negatively impact earnings  licensing of pse owned generation facilities  and other ferc and washington commission directives that may impact pse s long term goals 
in addition  pse is subject to risks inherent to the utility industry as a whole  including weather changes affecting purchases and sales of energy  outages at owned and non owned generation plants where energy is obtained  storms or other events which can damage gas and electric distribution and transmission lines  and wholesale market stability over time and significant evolving environmental legislation 
pse s main operational objective is to provide reliable  safe and cost effective energy to its customers 
to help accomplish this objective  pse is implementing a strategy to be more self sufficient in energy generation resources 
pse is continually exploring new electric power resource generation and long term purchase power agreements to meet this goal 
the completion of the hopkins ridge wind project in and the wild horse wind project in december are two steps in reaching this goal 
the hopkins ridge wind project provides a rated capacity of megawatts mw or average mw 
the wild horse wind project provides a rated capacity of mw or average mw 
these projects are considered to be non firm energy due to the reliance on wind to produce the energy 
the hopkins ridge wind project and the wild horse wind project were included as part of pse s energy resource portfolio in its long term electric irp that was filed may  with the washington commission 
the plan supports a strategy of diverse resource acquisitions including resources fueled by natural gas and coal  renewable resources and shared resources 
the irp was followed by issuing an all source request for proposal rfp on november  in addition  on february   pse acquired the goldendale generating station  a mw capacity natural gas generating facility in the state of washington  from the calpine corporation through its bankruptcy proceeding 
pse paid million for the generating facility 
in august  pse announced the selection of seven projects for further discussion and possible negotiation as a result of the rfp process 
in aggregate  these outside sources  if completed  would generate approximately  mw of long term power supply in total 
the outcome of such discussion and negotiation are not known at this time 
non gaap financial measures the following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  as well as two other financial measures  electric margin and gas margin  that are considered non gaap financial measures 
generally  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance  financial position or cash flows that exclude or include amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
the presentation of electric margin and gas margin is intended to supplement investors understanding of the company s operating performance 
electric margin and gas margin are used by the company to determine whether the company is collecting the appropriate amount of energy costs from its customers to allow recovery of operating costs 
our electric margin and gas margin measures may not be comparable to other companies electric margin and gas margin measures 
furthermore  these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of operating performance 
financial condition and results of operations puget energy all the operations of puget energy are conducted through its subsidiary pse 
net income in was million on operating revenues from continuing operations of billion compared to million on operating revenues from continuing operations of billion in and million on operating revenues from continuing operations of billion in income from continuing operations in was million compared to million in and million in basic earnings per share in was on million weighted average common shares outstanding compared to on million weighted average common shares outstanding in and on million weighted average common shares outstanding in diluted earnings per share in was on million weighted average common shares outstanding compared to on million weighted average common shares outstanding in and on million weighted average common shares outstanding in included in basic earnings per share for was compared to and for and  respectively  related to discontinued operations 
included in diluted earnings per share for was compared to and for and  respectively  related to discontinued operations 
income from continuing operations excluding the impact of the charitable contribution to the puget sound energy foundation was million for management of the company believes it is useful to present income from continuing operations and diluted earnings excluding the impact of the charitable contribution because it represents a more accurate measure of operating performance and facilitates period to period comparisons 
basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were for the twelve months ended december   excluding the impact of the charitable contribution to the puget sound energy foundation 
a reconciliation to amounts under gaap is as follows dollars in millions  except per share amounts twelve months ended december  income from continuing operations  as reported add impact of charitable contribution to foundation  net of tax income from continuing operations  excluding charitable contribution earnings per share basic and diluted earnings per share before cumulative effect of accounting change from continuing operations  as reported add impact of charitable contribution to foundation basic and diluted earnings per share before cumulative effect of accounting change from continuing operations  excluding charitable contribution net income in benefited from income from discontinued operations of infrastrux of million after tax compared to million after tax for puget energy s income from discontinued operations for includes million related to the reversal of a carrying value adjustment recorded in as well as million related to the anticipated realization of a deferred tax asset associated with the sale of the business 
natural gas and electric margins increased by million and million  respectively  for compared to  which positively impacted net income 
the increase in natural gas margins resulted from increased natural gas general tariff rates and increased sales volumes 
the increase in electric margins was the result of increased sales volumes  overrecovery of power costs under the power cost adjustment pca mechanism and two power cost only rate case pcorc rate increases effective november  and july  net income in was positively impacted by an increase in income from continuing operations of million due to increased electric and gas margins of million 
this increase was due primarily to a higher tenaska disallowance in of million compared to million in increased electricity and gas sales volumes increased margin by million as compared to gas margin also increased million as a result of the gas general rate case 
offsetting the increases were higher operations and maintenance costs of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
in addition  income from discontinued operations increased million in compared to primarily due to lower non cash impairments and favorable industry conditions in the utility construction services sector 
puget sound energy compared to energy margins the following table displays the details of electric margin changes from to electric margin is electric sales to retail and transportation customers less pass through tariff items and revenue sensitive taxes  and the cost of generating and purchasing electric energy sold to customers  including transmission costs to bring electric energy to pse s service territory 
electric margin dollars in millions twelve months ended december change percent change electric operating revenue less other electric operating revenue add other electric operating revenue gas supply resale total electric revenue for margin adjustments for amounts included in revenue pass through tariff items pass through revenue sensitive taxes net electric revenue for margin minus power costs purchased electricity electric generation fuel residential exchange total electric power costs electric margin as reported on pse s consolidated statement of income 
electric margin does not include any allocation for amortization depreciation expense or electric generation operation and maintenance expense 
electric margin increased million in compared to primarily due to the effects of the general rate case rate increase effective march  and the pcorc rate increases effective november  and july  which increased margin by million 
retail customer kilowatt hour kwh sales residential  commercial and industrial customers increased in compared to  which provided million to electric margin 
electric margin also increased by million due to overrecovery of excess power cost under the pca mechanism 
electric margin increased by million due to the reduction of the tenaska disallowance in the pca mechanism 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease related to production tax credits ptcs provided to customers through tariff rates  which are trued up to actual ptcs taken in an annual true up process and the non recurring benefit of a february  washington commission order allowing recovery of power costs that lowered electric margin by million 
the following table displays the details of gas margin changes from to gas margin is gas sales to retail and transportation customers less pass through tariff items and revenue sensitive taxes  and the cost of gas purchased  including gas transportation costs to bring gas to pse s service territory 
gas margin dollars in millions twelve months ended december change percent change gas operating revenue less other gas operating revenue total gas revenue for margin adjustments for amounts included in revenue pass through tariff items pass through revenue sensitive taxes net gas revenue for margin minus purchased gas costs gas margin as reported on pse s consolidated statement of income 
gas margin does not include any allocation for amortization depreciation expense or electric generation operations and maintenance expense 
gas margin increased million in compared to gas margin increased million due to a increase in gas therm volume sales  million of the increase was a result of the gas general tariff rate case which was effective march  these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in margin related to customer mix and pricing 
electric operating revenues the table below sets forth changes in electric operating revenues for pse from to dollars in millions twelve months ended december change percent change electric operating revenues residential sales commercial sales industrial sales other retail sales  including unbilled revenue total retail sales transportation sales sales to other utilities and marketers other total electric operating revenues electric retail sales increased million for compared to due primarily to rate increases related to the pcorc and the electric general rate case and increased retail customer usage 
the pcorc and electric general rate case provided a combined additional million to electric operating revenues for compared to retail electricity usage increased  mwh or for compared to the increase in electricity usage was mainly the result of a higher average number of customers served in compared to during  the benefits of the residential and small farm energy exchange benefit credited to customers reduced electric operating revenues by million compared to million for this credit also reduced power costs by a corresponding amount with no impact on earnings 
transportation sales increased million for compared to due to an increase in sales volume of  mwh or 
sales to other utilities and marketers decreased million compared to due primarily to a decrease in the wholesale market price of electricity in as compared to offset by an increase of  mwh in from other electric revenues decreased million in compared to  primarily associated with natural gas purchased for electric generation needs that was subsequently sold rather than used by pse or gains from electric generation financial derivatives on gas sold 
the following electric rate changes were approved by the washington commission in  and type of rate adjustment effective date average percentage increase in rates annual increase in revenues dollars in millions electric general rate case march  power cost only rate case november  power cost only rate case july  electric general rate case january  the rate increase is for the period july  through december  the annualized basis of the pcorc rate increase is million 
gas operating revenues the table below sets forth changes in gas operating revenues for pse from to dollars in millions twelve months ended december change percent change gas operating revenues residential sales commercial sales industrial sales total retail sales transportation sales other total gas operating revenues gas retail sales increased million for compared to due to higher purchased gas adjustment pga mechanism rates in  approval of a gas general rate increase effective march  and higher retail customer gas usage 
the washington commission approved a pga mechanism rate increase effective october  that provided million in gas revenues for compared to in addition  the gas general rate case increase provided an additional million in gas operating revenues for compared to in the remaining increase in gas retail revenues was primarily due to an increase in customers of and higher gas sales of million therms or million for compared to the following gas rate changes were approved by the washington commission in  and type of rate adjustment effective date average percentage increase in rates annual increase in revenues dollars in millions gas general rate case march  purchased gas adjustment october  purchased gas adjustment october  gas general rate case january  operating expenses the table below sets forth significant changes in operating expenses for pse from to dollars in millions twelve months ended december change percent change purchased electricity electric generation fuel residential exchange purchased gas utility operations and maintenance depreciation and amortization conservation amortization taxes other than income taxes income taxes purchased electricity expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to a increase in retail customer sales volumes and a increase in wholesale sales volumes 
total purchased power for increased  mwh  or a increase over increase in the purchased power volumes offset by slightly lower wholesale prices caused an increase of million in the increase in costs also reflected the recovery of previously deferred excess power costs of million due to lower power costs in than the baseline pca mechanism rate as compared to a deferral of excess power costs of million in also contributing to the increase in costs was a washington commission order that allowed pse to reflect additional power costs totaling million during the pca period of july  through december   in in addition  transmission and other expenses increased million due in part to increased kwh sales to customers 
pse s hydroelectric production and related power costs in were positively impacted by above normal precipitation and snow pack in the pacific northwest region  which resulted in the runoff above grand coulee reservoir to be of normal as compared to a below normal runoff of in the january early bird columbia basin runoff forecast published by the national weather service northwest river forecast center indicated that the total forecasted runoff above grand coulee reservoir for the period january through july would be near historical averages 
to meet customer demand  pse economically dispatches resources in its power supply portfolio such as fossil fuel generation  owned and contracted hydroelectric capacity and energy and long term contracted power 
however  depending principally upon availability of hydroelectric energy  plant availability  fuel prices and or changing load as a result of weather  pse may sell surplus power or purchase deficit power in the wholesale market 
pse manages its regulated power portfolio through short term and intermediate term off system physical purchases and sales and through other risk management techniques 
electric generation fuel expense increased million in compared to primarily due to an increase of million in the cost of fuel at pse controlled combustion turbine generating facilities due to higher costs of natural gas offset by slightly lower volumes of electricity generated and an increase in the cost of coal at colstrip generating facilities of million compared to residential exchange credits associated with the residential purchase and sale agreement with the bonneville power association bpa decreased million in compared to as a result of lower residential and small farm customer electric rates 
the residential exchange credit is a pass through tariff item with a corresponding credit in electric operating revenue  thus  it has no impact on electric margin or net income 
effective october   the annual payment pse receives from bpa decreased to million for the period through september  this will have no impact on pse s earnings as this payment is passed through to customers through a lower residential exchange tariff credit 
purchased gas expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to an increase in pga rates as approved by the washington commission and higher customer therm sales 
the pga mechanism allows pse to recover expected gas costs  and defer  as a receivable or liability  any gas costs that exceed or fall short of this expected gas cost amount in pga mechanism rates  including accrued interest 
the pga mechanism receivable balance at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
pse is authorized by the washington commission to accrue carrying costs on pga receivable balances 
a receivable balance in the pga mechanism reflects a current underrecovery of market gas cost through rates 
for further discussion on pga rates see item business gas regulation and rates 
utility operations and maintenance expense increased million in compared to primarily due to higher production costs of million related to a major overhauls of colstrip units and  the hopkins ridge wind project which became operational on november   soil remediation costs at pse s crystal mountain electric generation station site and costs to repair a failure of pse s whitehorn unit combustion turbine generator 
million of the increase was due to higher electric distribution system restoration costs as a result of a series of severe winter storms 
in addition  customer service and call center costs increased million and gas operations and distribution costs increased million 
these increases were slightly offset by a decrease of million in other expenses 
pse anticipates operation and maintenance expense to increase in future years as investments in new generating resources and energy delivery infrastructure are completed 
the timing and amounts of increases will vary depending on when new generating resources come into service 
a series of severe wind storms occurred during for which pse incurred significant costs  including a wind storm that occurred in december that resulted in a loss of electric service to over  of pse s customers 
pse incurred over million in estimated costs related to this wind storm  the majority of which were deferred in accordance with the washington commission s orders 
in total  pse deferred million of storm costs in as a result of a washington commission order that allowed deferral of qualified storm costs in excess of million 
qualifying storm costs are those that exceed the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ieee standard for determining system average interruption duration index 
conservation amortization increased million in compared to due to higher authorized recovery of electric conservation expenditures 
conservation amortization is a pass through tariff item with no impact on earnings 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to due primarily to the effects of new generating and electric and gas distribution system plant placed in service  of which million is from placing the hopkins ridge wind project in service on november  taxes other than income taxes increased million in compared to primarily due to increases in revenue based washington state excise tax and municipal tax due to increased operating revenues 
revenue sensitive excise and municipal taxes have no impact on earnings 
excluding the impact of revenue sensitive taxes  taxes other than income taxes decreased million primarily as a result of property tax reduction settled with the washington state department of revenue in august which resulted in a lower valuation for tax purposes in as compared to income taxes increased million in compared to was the result of higher taxable income slightly offset by a lower effective tax rate influenced by ptcs and the true up of the prior year federal income tax provision which resulted in an expense in versus a benefit in other income  other expenses  other income taxes and interest charges the table below sets forth significant changes in other income and interest charges for pse from to dollars in millions twelve months ended december change percent change other income other expenses income taxes interest charges percent change not applicable or meaningful 
other income increased million in compared to primarily due to an increase in the accrual of carrying costs on regulatory assets and an increase in the equity portion of allowance for funds used during construction afudc 
other expenses decreased by million due to a decrease in long term share based incentive plan costs offset by certain regulatory penalty expenses incurred in income taxes on other income and expenses increased million in as compared to is a result of the increase in other income 
interest charges increased million in compared to due primarily to interest expense of million related to an increase in debt due to construction projects offset by an increase in the debt afudc credit 

infrastrux on may   puget energy sold its interest in infrastrux to an affiliate of tenaska  resulting in after tax cash proceeds of approximately million  an after tax gain of million for puget energy accounted for infrastrux as a discontinued operation under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets in and under the terms of the sale agreement  puget energy remains obligated for certain representations and warranties made by infrastrux concerning its business through may  puget energy obtained a representation and warranty insurance policy and deposited million into an escrow account as retention under the policy 
as of december   long term restricted cash in the amount of million is included in the accompanying balance sheets and represents puget energy s maximum exposure related to those commitments 
puget energy also agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain potential future losses related to one of infrastrux s subsidiaries through may   with the maximum amount of loss not to exceed million 
a liability in the amount of million is included in the accompanying balance sheets as of december   which represents puget energy s estimate of the fair value of the amount potentially payable using a probability weighted approach to a range of future cash flows 
puget energy also provided an environmental guarantee as part of the sale agreement 
puget energy believes it will not have a future loss in connection with the environmental guarantee 
for  puget energy reported infrastrux related income from discontinued operations  including gain on sale  of million compared to million for in each case  net of taxes and minority interest 
puget energy s income from discontinued operations for includes million related to the reversal of a carrying value adjustment recorded in as well as million related to the anticipated realization of a deferred tax asset associated with the sale of the business 
infrastrux s operating revenue through may  was million compared to million for the twelve months ended december  pre tax income for the twelve months ended december  was million compared to million for the same period in puget sound energy compared to energy margins the following table displays the details of electric margin changes from to electric margin is electric sales to retail and transportation customers less pass through tariff items and revenue sensitive taxes  and the cost of generating and purchasing electric energy sold to customers  including transmission costs to bring electric energy to pse s service territory

electric margin does not include any allocation for amortization depreciation expense or electric generation operation and maintenance expense 
electric margin increased million in compared to primarily as a result of the tenaska disallowance recorded in may  and ongoing tenaska disallowances  which reduced margin by million for compared to million in other items that increased margin include a increase in retail customer usage which contributed million to margin 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in transmission and transportation revenues in compared to which reduced electric margin by million 
customers also received a reduction in revenue of million related to production tax credits for the hopkins ridge wind generating facility which lowered electric revenue and margin 
these credits vary quarter to quarter and over time the amounts credited to customers through lower electric rates will equal the amount used for federal income taxes 
a lower authorized return on electric generating facilities that became effective on march  also lowered electric margin by million

electric operating revenues the table below sets forth changes in electric operating revenues for pse from to dollars in millions twelve months ended december change percent change electric operating revenues residential sales commercial sales industrial sales other retail sales  including unbilled revenue total retail sales transportation sales sales to other utilities and marketers other total electric operating revenues electric retail sales increased million for compared to due primarily to rate increases related to the pcorc and the electric general rate case and increased retail customer usage 
the pcorc and electric general rate case provided a combined additional million to electric operating revenues for compared to  which provided approximately million in electric operating revenues 
retail electricity usage increased  mwh or for compared to the increase in electricity usage was mainly the result of a higher average number of customers served in compared to during  the benefits of the residential and small farm energy exchange benefit credited to customers reduced electric operating revenues by million compared to million for this credit also reduced power costs by a corresponding amount with no impact on earnings 
sales to other utilities and marketers increased million compared to primarily due to an increase of  mwh sold related to excess generation and energy available for sale on the wholesale market 
this resulted primarily from normal streamflows for hydroelectric generation in the third quarter as compared to below normal streamflows that were expected 
the increase in mwh sold was due to differences in timing of the need for power to serve base load and actual weather conditions 
other electric revenues increased million for compared to  primarily from the sale of excess non core gas purchased for intended electric generation 
non core gas sales are included in the pca mechanism calculation as a reduction in determining costs

the reduction of million related to the tenaska disallowance from included a february  washington commission order concerning pse s compliance filing related to the pca period of july  through june  in its order  the washington commission determined that pse was allowed to reflect additional power costs totaling million during the pca period of july  through december  these costs were reflected in the pca mechanism  which resulted in a reduction in purchased electricity expense for total purchased power for increased  mwh  or an increase over pse s hydroelectric production and related power costs in and were negatively impacted by below normal precipitation and reduced snow pack in the pacific northwest region 
the january  columbia basin runoff summary published by the national weather service northwest river forecast center indicated that the total observed runoff above grand coulee reservoir for was of normal  which approximates the total observed runoff for electric generation fuel expense decreased million in compared to primarily due to a million charge recorded in related to a binding arbitration settlement between western energy company and pse 
excluding this settlement  electric generation fuel costs decreased million related to overall lower cost of gas for combustion turbine units and cost of gas at those facilities totaling million 
the decrease in lower cost of gas was partially offset by an increase of the cost of coal of million in compared to due to higher generation at colstrip generating facilities of  mwh 
costs associated with electric generation fuel are reflected in the pca mechanism 
the reduction in electric generation fuel was also the result of the hopkins ridge wind generation facility beginning operations on november  generation from the hopkins ridge generation facility does not include fuel expenses in its operation 
residential exchange credits associated with the residential purchase and sale agreement with bpa increased million in compared to as a result of increased residential and small farm customer electric load 
the residential exchange credit is a pass through tariff item with a corresponding credit in electric operating revenue  thus it has no impact on electric margin or net income

the production operation and maintenance increase for also includes a million loss reserve associated with an arbitration panel s ruling in favor of the muckleshoot indian tribe relating to the operation of a fish hatchery on the white river recorded in the second quarter these increases were partially offset by lower storm damage repair costs of million for due to less severe weather and outages 
total storm damage costs for totaled million compared to million in depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to due primarily to the effects of new generating and electric and gas distribution system plant placed in service in new plant placed in service in includes million for the hopkins ridge wind project in november taxes other than income taxes increased million in compared to primarily due to increases in revenue based washington state excise tax and municipal tax due to increased operating revenues 
revenue sensitive excise and municipal taxes have no impact on earnings 
income taxes increased million in compared to as a result of higher taxable income and the non recurrence of the one time income tax benefit of million in related to a tax audit 
other income and interest charges the table below sets forth significant changes in other income and interest charges for pse from to dollars in millions twelve months ended december change percent change other income other expenses interest charges other income increased million in compared to primarily due to increases in the equity portion of allowance for funds used during construction and an increase in revenue from pse s basic ordering agreement for energy management projects with the us navy 
other expenses decreased by million primarily due to a decrease in long term incentive plan costs due to not meeting the performance condition 
interest charges decreased million in compared to due to the redemption of million of long term debt with rates ranging from to in also  in may  pse redeemed million of pse s capital trust preferred securities classified as junior subordinated debentures of the corporation payable to a subsidiary trust holding mandatorily redeemable preferred securities on the balance sheet 
these redemptions and resulting decreases in interest expense were partially offset by the issuance of million and million of long term senior notes in may and october  respectively 
in addition  debt afudc credited to interest expense increased million due to increased construction activity in infrastrux compared to the following table summarizes puget energy s income from discontinued operations for and dollars in millions income from operations reported by infrastrux goodwill impairment tax provision on goodwill impairment net loss at infrastrux goodwill impairment not recognized at puget energy infrastrux depreciation and amortization not recorded by puget energy  net of tax puget energy tax benefit valuation allowance from goodwill impairment carrying value adjustment to estimated fair value and transaction costs minority interest in income from discontinued operations income loss from discontinued operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

pse leases two combustion turbines for its fredonia and electric generating facility pursuant to a master operating lease that was amended for this purpose in april the lease has a term expiring in  but can be canceled by pse at any time 
payments under the lease vary with changes in the london interbank offered rate libor 
at december   pse s outstanding balance under the lease was million 
the expected residual value under the lease is the lesser of million or of the cost of the equipment 
in the event the equipment is sold to a third party upon termination of the lease and the aggregate sales proceeds are less than the unamortized value of the equipment  pse would be required to pay the lessor contingent rent in an amount equal to the deficiency up to a maximum of of the unamortized value of the equipment 
utility construction program utility construction expenditures for generation  transmission and distribution are designed to meet continuing customer growth and to support reliability of pse s energy delivery systems 
construction expenditures  excluding equity afudc and customer refundable contributions  were million for utility construction expenditures  excluding afudc and excluding new generation resources other than the wild horse project which will be determined as the company proceeds through the integrated resource planning process are anticipated to be the following in  and capital expenditure projections dollars in millions energy delivery  technology and facilities new resources total expenditures the proposed utility construction expenditures and any new generation resource expenditures that may be incurred are anticipated to be funded with a combination of cash from operations  short term debt  long term debt and equity 
construction expenditure estimates  including the new generation resources  are subject to periodic review and adjustment in light of changing economic  regulatory  environmental and efficiency factors 
new generation resources on december   pse placed into service the wild horse wind project 
wild horse is located in central washington state 
the wild horse wind project features turbines providing up to mw  generating enough wind fueled electricity on average to serve  of the company s electric customers in western washington and kittitas county 
capital resources cash from operations cash generated from operations for was million  which is of the million used for utility construction expenditures and other capital expenditures 
for  cash generated from operations was million which is of the million used for utility construction expenditures and other capital expenditures 
the overall cash generated from operating activities for decreased million compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to deferred storm damage costs of million and to a non refundable capacity reservation payment of million in april for the chelan pud power sales agreement which will begin providing power to pse at the end of in addition  million of cash collateral related to natural gas supply contracts was returned in and million was received in for funds received from a gas pipeline capacity contract obligation of duke energy marketing and trading 
further  there was an increase of million in payments made for accounts payable related to energy purchases which contributed to the decrease 
partially offsetting the decrease was an increase in accounts receivable balances of million as compared to which was primarily attributable to the change in the accounts receivable securitization program 
in addition  there was an increase in cash received for the purchased gas receivable adjustment of million  a beneficial increase in the change of the power cost adjustment of million  an increase in accrued expenses of million and a decrease in bpa prepaid transmission of million in that further offset the decrease in cash generated from operating activities 
financing program financing utility construction requirements and operational needs are dependent upon the cost and availability of external funds through capital markets and from financial institutions 
access to funds depends upon factors such as general economic conditions  regulatory authorizations and policies and puget energy s and pse s credit ratings 
restrictive covenants in determining the type and amount of future financing  pse may be limited by restrictions contained in its electric and gas mortgage indentures  restated articles of incorporation and certain loan agreements 
under the most restrictive tests  at december   pse could issue approximately million of additional first mortgage bonds under pse s electric mortgage indenture based on approximately million of electric bondable property available for issuance  subject to an interest coverage ratio limitation of times net earnings available for interest as defined in the electric utility mortgage  which pse exceeded at december   approximately million of additional first mortgage bonds under pse s gas mortgage indenture based on approximately million of gas bondable property available for issuance  subject to interest coverage ratio limitations of times and times net earnings available for interest as defined in the gas utility mortgage  which pse exceeded at december   approximately million of additional preferred stock at an assumed dividend rate of  and approximately million of unsecured long term debt 
at december   pse had approximately billion in electric and gas ratebase to support the interest coverage ratio limitation test for net earnings available for interest 
sfas no 
will not have an impact on pse s ratebase 
credit ratings the ratings of puget energy and pse  as of february   were ratings standard poor s moody s puget sound energy corporate credit issuer rating bbb baa senior secured debt bbb baa shelf debt senior secured bbb p baa trust preferred securities bb ba preferred stock bb ba commercial paper a p revolving credit facility baa ratings outlook stable stable puget energy corporate credit issuer rating bbb ba standard poor s does not rate pse s credit facilities 
neither puget energy nor pse has any debt outstanding that would accelerate debt maturity upon a credit rating downgrade 
however  a ratings downgrade could adversely affect the ability to renew existing  or obtain access to new  credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities 
for example  under pse s revolving credit facility  the borrowing costs and commitment fee increase as pse s secured long term debt ratings decline 
a downgrade in commercial paper ratings could preclude pse s ability to issue commercial paper under its current programs 
the marketability of pse commercial paper is currently limited by the a p ratings by standard poor s and moody s investors service 
in addition  downgrades in any or a combination of pse s debt ratings may prompt counterparties on a contract by contract basis in the wholesale electric  wholesale gas and financial derivative markets to require pse to post a letter of credit or other collateral  make cash prepayments  obtain a guarantee agreement or provide other mutually agreeable security 
shelf registrations  long term debt and common stock activity on march   puget energy and pse filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the offering of common stock of puget energy  senior notes of pse  secured by first mortgage bonds  preferred stock of pse  and trust preferred securities of puget sound energy capital trust iii 
the registration statement is valid for three years and does not specify the amount of securities that the company may offer 
the company is subject to restrictions under pse s indentures and articles of incorporation on the amount of first mortgage bonds  unsecured debt and preferred stock that the company may issue 
on september   pse completed the issuance of million of senior secured notes at a rate of  which are due on march  the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes of approximately million will be used to repay pse s outstanding short term debt which was incurred primarily to fund construction programs 
the yield to maturity of the million senior secured notes was after the settlement of two forward starting swap contracts 
on june   pse redeemed for million all of the outstanding shares of trust originated preferred securities of the puget sound energy capital trust ii classified as junior subordinated debentures of the corporation payable to a subsidiary trust holding mandatorily redeemable preferred securities on the balance sheet at par value per share plus accrued interest to the redemption date 
on june   pse completed the issuance of million of senior secured notes at a rate of which are due on june  the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes of approximately million were used to redeem million of trust originated preferred securities of the puget sound energy capital trust ii  which were redeemed at par on june   and to repay a portion of pse s short term debt 
the short term debt was incurred to repay million of senior notes that matured june  the yield to maturity of the million senior secured notes was after the settlement of two forward starting swap contracts 
based on pse s goal to become a more vertically integrated utility  it is expected that further issuances of debt  equity or a combination of the two will be necessary in the future 
the structure  timing and amount of such financings depend on market conditions and financing needed 
liquidity facilities and commercial paper pse s short term borrowings and sales of commercial paper are used to provide working capital and funding of utility construction programs 
pse credit facilities the company has two committed credit facilities that provide  in aggregate  million in short term borrowing capability 
these include a million credit agreement and a million accounts receivable securitization facility 
the unsecured credit agreement can be terminated by either party upon written notice 
pse pays a varying interest rate on outstanding borrowings based on terms entered into at the time of the borrowings 
demand promissory note 
on june   pse entered into a revolving credit facility with its parent  puget energy  in the form of a demand promissory note note 
through the note  pse may borrow up to million from puget energy  subject to approval by puget energy 
under the terms of the note  pse pays interest on the outstanding borrowings based on the lowest of the weighted average interest rate of a pse s outstanding commercial paper interest rate  b pse s senior unsecured revolving credit facility  or c the interest rate available under the receivable securitization facility of pse funding  inc  a pse subsidiary  which is the libor rate plus a marginal rate 
at december   the outstanding balance of the note was million 
the outstanding balance and the related interest under the note are eliminated by puget energy upon consolidation of pse s financial statements 
credit agreement 
in march  pse entered into a five year  million unsecured credit agreement with a group of banks 
in april  pse amended this credit agreement to extend the expiration date from april to april the agreement is primarily used to provide credit support for commercial paper and letters of credit 
under the terms of the credit agreement  pse pays a floating interest rate on outstanding borrowings based either on the agent bank s prime rate or on libor plus a marginal rate based on pse s long term credit rating at the time of borrowing 
pse pays a commitment fee on any unused portion of the credit agreement which is also based on long term credit ratings of pse 
at december   there was million outstanding under a letter of credit and million commercial paper outstanding  effectively reducing the available borrowing capacity under the credit facility to million 
receivables securitization facility 
pse entered into a five year receivable sales agreement with pse funding  inc pse funding  a wholly owned subsidiary  on december  pursuant to the receivables sales agreement  pse sells all of its utility customer accounts receivable and unbilled utility revenues to pse funding 
in addition  pse funding entered into a loan and servicing agreement with pse and two banks 
the loan and servicing agreement allows pse funding to use the receivables as collateral to secure short term loans  not exceeding the lesser of million or the borrowing base of eligible receivables which fluctuate with the seasonality of energy sales to customers 
all loans from this facility will be reported as short term debt in the financial statements 
the pse funding facility expires in december  and is terminable by pse and pse funding upon notice to the banks 
during  pse funding borrowed a cumulative amount of million secured by accounts receivable 
there was million in loans that were secured by accounts receivable pledged at december  the borrowing available under the receivables securitization at december  was million 
stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan puget energy has a stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan pursuant to which shareholders and other interested investors may invest cash and cash dividends in shares of puget energy s common stock 
since new shares of common stock may be purchased directly from puget energy  funds received may be used for general corporate purposes 
puget energy issued common stock from the stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan of million  shares in compared to million  shares in the proceeds from sales of stock under these plans are used for general corporate needs 
common stock offering programs to provide additional financing options  puget energy entered into agreements in july with two financial institutions under which puget energy may offer and sell shares of its common stock from time to time through these institutions as sales agents  or as principals 
sales of the common stock  if any  may be made by means of negotiated transactions or in transactions that may be deemed to be at the market offerings as defined in rule promulgated under the securities act of  including in ordinary brokers transactions on the new york stock exchange nyse at market prices 
other irs audit 
as a matter of course  the company s tax returns are routinely audited by federal  state and city tax authorities 
in may of  the irs completed its examination of the company s  and federal income tax returns 
the company is formally appealing two irs audit adjustments 
the first adjustment relates to the receivable balance due from the california independent system operator caiso 
the irs claims that the deduction was not valid for the tax year and would require repayment of approximately million in tax 
the company believes the deduction is valid and intends to vigorously defend the deduction 
any potential tax payment excluding interest would have no impact on earnings  as it would be recognized as a deferred tax asset 
if the company is unsuccessful  a charge for interest expense would apply 
the second irs audit adjustment relates to the company s accounting method with respect to capitalized internal labor and overheads 
in its tax return  pse claimed a deduction when it changed its tax accounting method with respect to capitalized internal labor and overheads 
under the new method  the company could immediately deduct certain costs that it had previously capitalized 
in the audit  the irs disallowed the deduction 
on august   the internal revenue service and the treasury department issued revenue ruling and related regulations 
the revenue ruling and the regulations required utility companies  including pse  to adopt a less advantageous method of accounting and to repay the accumulated tax benefits 
through september   the company claimed million in accumulated tax benefits 
pse accounted for the accumulated tax benefits as temporary differences in determining its deferred income tax balances 
consequently  the repayment of the tax benefits did not impact earnings but did have a cash flow impact of million in the fourth quarter and million in as of december   the full tax benefit had been repaid 
there is some uncertainty in the new guidance 
pse believes that the new regulations required the company to repay the accumulated tax benefits over the and tax years and that the tax deductions claimed on the company s tax returns were appropriate based on the applicable statutes  regulations and case law in effect at the time 
however  there is no assurance that pse s appeal will prevail 
if the company is unsuccessful  a charge for interest expense would apply 
on october   pse filed an accounting petition with the washington commission to defer the capital costs associated with repayment of the deferred tax 
the washington commission had reduced pse s ratebase by million in its order of february  the accounting petition was approved by the washington commission on october   for deferral of additional capital costs beginning november  using pse s allowed net of tax rate of return 
the washington commission granted cost recovery of these deferred carrying costs over two years  beginning january  tenaska disallowance 
the washington commission issued an order on may  determining that pse did not prudently manage gas costs for the tenaska electric generating plant and ordered pse to adjust its pca deferral account to reflect a disallowance of accumulated costs under the pca mechanism for these excess costs 
the increase in purchased electricity expense resulting from the disallowance totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the order also established guidelines and a benchmark to determine pse s recovery on the tenaska regulatory asset starting with the pca period july  through the expiration of the tenaska contract in the year the benchmark is defined as the original cost of the tenaska contract adjusted to reflect the disallowance from a prudence order 
in august pse filed the pca period compliance and received an order from the washington commission on february  in the pca compliance order  the washington commission approved the washington commission staff s recommendation for an additional return related to the tenaska regulatory asset in the amount of million related to the period july  through december  the washington commission confirmed that if the tenaska gas costs are deemed prudent  pse will recover the full amount of actual gas costs and the recovery of the tenaska regulatory asset even if the benchmark is exceeded 
due to fluctuations in forward market prices of gas  the amount and timing of any potential disallowance related to tenaska can change significantly day to day 
the projected costs and projected benchmark costs for tenaska as of december  based on current forward market gas prices are as follows dollars in millions projected tenaska costs projected tenaska benchmark costs over under benchmark costs projected disallowance based on washington commission methodology projection will change based on market conditions of gas and replacement power costs 
proceedings relating to the western power market the following discussion summarizes the status as of the date of this report of ongoing proceedings relating to the western power markets to which pse is a party 
pse is vigorously defending each of these cases 
litigation is subject to numerous uncertainties and pse is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters 
accordingly  there can be no guarantee that these proceedings  either individually or in the aggregate  will not materially and adversely affect pse s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
california receivable and california refund proceeding 
since  pse has held a receivable relating to unpaid bills for power that pse sold in into the markets maintained by the caiso 
at december   the net receivable for such sales was approximately million 
pse s ability to recover all or a portion of this amount is uncertain 
at this time there is no reasonable basis under applicable financial accounting rules to adjust pse s net receivable because the outcome of further court and ferc actions is uncertain and any likely financial impact cannot be quantified 
in  ferc ordered an evidentiary hearing docket no 
el to determine the amount of refunds due to california energy buyers for purchases made in the spot markets operated by the caiso and the california px during the period october  through june  refund period 
ferc also ordered that if the refunds required by the formula it adopted would cause a seller to recover less than its actual costs for the refund period  the seller is allowed to document its costs and limit its refund liability commensurately 
consistent with those orders  pse filed a fuel cost adjustment claim and a portfolio cost claim 
recovery of those amounts is uncertain  but the amount owed to pse under all ferc orders to date is included in the pse net receivable amount 
ferc has not issued a final order determining who owes how much to whom in the california refund proceeding  and it is not clear when such an order will be issued 
in the course of the california refund proceeding  ferc has issued dozens of orders 
most have been taken up on appeal before the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit ninth circuit  which has issued opinions on some issues in the last several years 
these cases are described below in the section  california litigation 
california litigation 
lockyer v 
ferc 
on september   the ninth circuit issued a decision on the california attorney general s challenge to the validity of ferc s market based rate system 
this case was originally presented to ferc upon complaint that the adoption and implementation of market rate authority was flawed 
ferc dismissed the complaint after all sellers refiled summaries of transactions with california entities during and the ninth circuit upheld ferc s authority to authorize sales of electric energy at market based rates  but found the requirement that all sales at market based rates be contained in quarterly reports filed with ferc to be integral to a market based rate tariff 
the california parties  among others  have interpreted the decision as providing authority to ferc to order refunds for different time frames and based on different rationales than are currently pending in the california refund proceedings  discussed above in california refund proceeding 
the decision itself remands to ferc the question of whether to allow refunds 
on december   pse and several other energy sellers filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the us supreme court 
the us supreme court has not yet acted on that petition 
pse cannot predict the scope  nature or ultimate resolution of this case 
that additional uncertainty may make the outcomes of certain other western energy market cases less predictable than previously anticipated 
cpuc v 
ferc 
on august   the ninth circuit decided that ferc erred in excluding potential relief for tariff violations for periods that pre dated october  and additionally ruled that ferc should consider remedies for transactions previously considered outside the scope of the proceedings 
the august  decision may adversely impact pse s ability to recover the full amount of its caiso receivable 
the decision may also expose pse to claims or liabilities for transactions outside the previously defined refund period 
at this time the ultimate financial outcome for pse is unclear 
the deadline for seeking rehearing of the august  decision is april   and it is likely that some parties will seek rehearing 
in addition  parties have been engaged in court sponsored settlement discussions  and those discussions may result in some settlements 
pse is studying the court s decision  but is unable to predict either the outcome of the proceedings or the ultimate financial effect on pse 
california class actions 
in  reliant energy services reliant and duke energy trading marketing duke cross complained against pse in several class actions filed in california arising from the california energy crisis 
duke and reliant settled the underlying cases and subsequently dismissed the cross complaints against the cross defendants  including pse 
orders to show cause 
on june   ferc issued two show cause orders pertaining to its western market investigations that commenced individual proceedings against many sellers 
one show cause order investigated entities that allegedly had potential partnerships with enron 
pse was not named in that show cause order 
on january   ferc stated that it did not intend to proceed further against other parties 
the second show cause order named pse docket no 
el and approximately other entities that alleg edly had engaged in potential gaming practices in the caiso and california px markets 
pse and ferc staff filed a proposed settlement of all issues pending against pse in those proceedings on august  the proposed settlement  which admits no wrongdoing on the part of pse  would result in a payment of a nominal amount to settle all claims 
ferc approved the settlement on january  the california parties filed for rehearing of that order 
on march   pse moved to dismiss the california parties rehearing request and awaits ferc action on that motion 
pacific northwest refund proceeding 
in october  pse filed a complaint at ferc docket no 
el against all jurisdictional sellers in the pacific northwest seeking prospective price caps consistent with any result ferc ordered for the california markets 
ferc dismissed pse s complaint  but pse challenged that dismissal 
on june   ferc ordered price caps on energy sales throughout the west 
various parties  including the port of seattle and the cities of seattle and tacoma  then moved to intervene in the proceeding seeking retroactive refunds for numerous transactions 
the proceeding became known as the pacific northwest refund proceeding  though refund claims were outside the scope of the original complaint 
on june   ferc terminated the proceeding on procedural  jurisdictional and equitable grounds and on november   ferc on rehearing  confirmed the order terminating the proceeding 
petitions for review  including pse s  are now pending before the ninth circuit 
the ninth circuit held argument on the petitions on january   and the matter now awaits that court s decision 
port of seattle suit 
on may   the port of seattle commenced suit in federal court in seattle against energy sellers  including pse  alleging that their conduct during and constituted market manipulation  violated antitrust laws and damaged the port of seattle 
on may   the district court dismissed the lawsuit 
the port of seattle filed an appeal to the ninth circuit 
after briefing and oral argument on march   the ninth circuit issued an order dismissing the case 
wah chang suit 
in june  wah chang  an oregon company  filed suit in federal court against puget energy and pse  among others 
the complaint is similar to the allegations made by the port of seattle described above 
the case was dismissed on the grounds that ferc has the exclusive jurisdiction over plaintiff s claims 
on march   wah chang filed a notice of appeal to the ninth circuit 
oral argument is scheduled to take place on april  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
the following accounting policies represent those that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates  assumptions and judgment to describe matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition 
utility revenues are recognized when the basis of service is rendered  which includes estimates to determine amounts relating to services rendered but not billed 
unbilled electricity revenue is determined by taking mwh generated and purchased less estimated system losses and billed mwh plus unbilled mwh balance at the last true up date 
the estimated system loss percentage for electricity is determined by reviewing historical billed mwh to generated and purchased mwh 
the estimated unbilled mwh balance is then multiplied by the estimated average revenue per mwh 
unbilled gas revenue is determined by taking therms delivered to pse less estimated system losses  prior month unbilled therms and billed therms 
the estimated system loss percentage for gas is determined by reviewing historical billed therms to therms delivered to customers  which vary little from year to year 
the estimated current month unbilled therms is then multiplied by estimated average rate schedule revenue per therm 
non utility revenue is recognized when services are performed or upon the sale of assets 
the recognition of revenue is in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue 
regulatory accounting 
as a regulated entity of the washington commission and ferc  pse prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
the application of sfas no 
results in differences in the timing and recognition of certain revenues and expenses in comparison with businesses in other industries 
the rates that are charged by pse to its customers are based on cost base regulation reviewed and approved by the washington commission and ferc 
under the authority of these commissions  pse has recorded certain regulatory assets and liabilities at december  in the amount of million and million  respectively  and regulatory assets and liabilities of million and million  respectively  at december  pse expects to fully recover these regulatory assets and liabilities through its rates 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  pse would be required to write off these regulatory assets and liabilities 
in addition  if at some point in the future pse determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of sfas no 
 pse could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities 
also encompassed by regulatory accounting and subject to sfas no 
are the pca and pga mechanisms 
the pca and pga mechanisms mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility upon the company and are approved by the washington commission 
the pca mechanism provides for a sharing of costs that vary from baseline rates over a graduated scale 
see item business regulation and rates electric regulation and rates for further discussion regarding the pca mechanism 
the pga mechanism passes through to customers increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply 
pse expects to fully recover these regulatory assets through its rates 
however  both mechanisms are subject to regulatory review and approval by the washington commission on a periodic basis 
derivatives 
puget energy uses derivative financial instruments primarily to manage its energy commodity price risks and may enter into certain financial derivatives to manage interest rate risk 
derivative financial instruments are accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
accounting for derivatives continues to evolve through guidance issued by the derivatives implementation group dig of the financial accounting standards board fasb 
to the extent that changes by the dig modify current guidance  including the normal purchases and normal sales determination  the accounting treatment for derivatives may change 
to manage its electric and gas portfolios  puget energy enters into contracts to purchase or sell electricity and gas 
these contracts are considered derivatives under sfas no 
unless a determination is made that they qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception 
if the exception applies  those contracts are not marked to market and are not reflected in the financial statements until delivery occurs 
the availability of the normal purchase and normal sale exception to specific contracts is based on a determination that a resource is available for a forward sale and similarly a determination that at certain times existing resources will be insufficient to serve load 
this determination is based on internal models that forecast customer demand and generation supply 
the models include assumptions regarding customer load growth rates  which are influenced by the economy  weather and the impact of customer choice and resource availability 
the critical assumptions used in the determination of the normal purchases and normal sales exception are consistent with assumptions used in the energy portfolio management process 
energy and financial contracts that are considered derivatives may be eligible for designation as cash flow hedges 
if a contract is designated as a cash flow hedge  the change in its market value is generally deferred as a component of other comprehensive income until the transaction it is hedging is completed 
conversely  the change in the market value of derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in current period earnings 
pse values derivative instruments based on daily quoted prices from numerous independent energy brokerage services 
when external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts  pse uses a valuation model that uses volatility assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price curves 
all derivative instruments are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
puget energy has a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees of pse 
qualified pension expense of million was recorded in and income of million and million was recorded in the financial statements for and  respectively 
of these amounts  approximately  and offset utility operations and maintenance expense in  and  respectively  and the remaining amounts were capitalized 
qualified pension expense is expected to be million in pse s pension and other postretirement benefits income or costs depend on several factors and assumptions  including plan design  timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan  earnings on plan assets  discount rate  expected long term rate of return  mortality and health care cost trends 
changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that puget energy records in its financial statements in future years and its projected benefit obligation 
the company has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the company s investment mix  market conditions  inflation and other factors 
the company s accounting policy for calculating the market related value of assets is based on a five year smoothing of asset gains losses measured from the expected return on market related assets 
this is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years 
the same manner of calculating market related value is used for all classes of assets  and is applied consistently from year to year 
during  pse made no cash contributions to the qualified defined benefit plan and expects to make no contributions in the following table reflects the estimated sensitivity associated with a change in certain significant actuarial assumptions each assumption change is presented mutually exclusive of other assumption changes change in assumption impact on projected benefit obligation increase decrease impact on pension income increase decrease dollars in thousands pension benefits other benefits pension benefits other benefits increase in discount rate basis points decrease in discount rate basis points increase in return of plan assets basis points decrease in return on plan assets basis points calculation not applicable 
california receivable 
pse operates within the western wholesale market and has made sales into the california energy market 
at december   pse s receivables from the caiso and other counterparties was million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk energy portfolio management the company has energy risk policies and procedures to manage commodity and volatility risks 
the company s energy management committee establishes the company s energy risk management policies and procedures  and monitors compliance 
the energy management committee is comprised of certain company officers and is overseen by the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
the company is focused on commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the gas and electric portfolios 
it is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading 
the company hedges open gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices 
the exposure position is determined by using a probabilistic risk system that models scenarios of how the company s gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather  hydro and unit performance conditions 
the objective of the hedging strategy is ensure physical energy supplies are available to reliably and cost effectively serve retail load  prudent management of energy portfolio risks to serve retail load at overall least cost and limit undesired impacts on pse s customers and shareholders  and reduce power costs by extracting the value of the company s assets 
at december   the company had a short term asset of million and a short term liability of million  primarily as a result of de designating gas financial contracts 
these contracts were related to electric generation that was no longer probable 
during  the company recorded a decrease in earnings for the change in the market value of derivative instruments not meeting the normal purchase normal sale exception or cash flow hedge criteria under sfas no 
of million compared to a decrease in earnings of million for and an increase of million for at december   pse had a short term asset of million and a long term asset of million as well as a short term liability of million and a long term liability of million related to energy contracts designated as cash flow hedges that represent forward financial purchases of gas supply for electric generation from pse owned electric plants in future periods 
these contracts were designated as qualifying cash flow hedges and a corresponding unrealized gain of million  net of tax  was recorded in other comprehensive income 
if it is determined that it is uneconomical to run the plants in the future period  the hedging relationship is ended and the cash flow hedge is de designated and any unrealized gains and losses are recorded in the income statement 
gains and losses  when these de designated cash flow hedges are settled  are recognized in energy costs and are included as part of the pca mechanism 
at december   the company had an unrealized gain recorded in other comprehensive income of million net of tax  before sfas no 
deferrals of million  related to energy contracts which met the criteria for designation as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
this was mainly the result of higher forward market prices for natural gas and electricity at december  compared to december  at december   the company had a short term asset of million and a short term liability of million as well as a long term asset of million related to the hedges of gas contracts to serve natural gas customers 
all mark to market adjustments relating to the natural gas business have been reclassified to a deferred account in accordance with sfas no 
due to the pga mechanism 
all increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply are passed on to customers with the pga mechanism 
as the gains and losses on the hedges are realized in future periods  they will be recorded as gas costs under the pga mechanism 
at december   the company had a net asset of million related to the hedge of gas contracts to serve natural gas customers 
a hypothetical decrease in the market prices of natural gas and electricity would decrease the fair value of qualifying cash flow hedges by million and would have no effect for those contracts marked to market in earnings

credit risk is the potential loss resulting from a counterparty s non performance under an agreement 
the company manages credit risk with policies and procedures for  among other things  counterparty analysis  exposure measurement  exposure monitoring and exposure mitigation 
it is possible that extreme volatility in energy commodity prices could cause the company to have credit risk exposures with one or more counterparties 
if such counterparties fail to perform their obligations under one or more agreements  the company could suffer a material financial loss 
however  as of december   approximately of the counterparties comprising the sources of our energy portfolio are rated at least investment grade by the major rating agencies and are either rated below investment grade or are not rated by rating agencies 
the company assesses credit risk internally for counterparties that are not rated 
interest rate risk the company believes its interest rate risk primarily relates to the use of short term debt instruments  variable rate notes and leases and anticipated long term debt financing needed to fund capital requirements 
the company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed rate debt of various maturities 
the company utilizes bank borrowings  commercial paper  line of credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization to meet short term cash requirements 
these short term obligations are commonly refinanced with fixed rate bonds or notes when needed and when interest rates are considered favorable 
the company may enter into swap instruments or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with these debts 
the company did not have any swap instruments outstanding on fixed rate debt as of december  or  however from time to time the company may enter into treasury lock or forward starting swap contracts to hedge interest rate exposure related to anticipated debt issuance 
the carrying amounts and the fair values of the company s debt instruments are dollars in millions carrying amount fair value carrying amount fair value financial liabilities short term debt short term debt owed by pse to puget energy long term debt fixed rate pse s carrying value and fair value of fixed rate long term debt was the same as puget energy s debt in and in the second quarter  the company settled two forward starting swap contracts which originated in may the purpose of the forward starting swap contracts was to hedge a debt offering of million that was completed on june  pse received million from the counterparties when the contracts were settled 
the forward starting swap contracts were designated and documented under sfas no 
criteria as cash flow hedges  with all changes in market value for each reporting period presented net of tax in other comprehensive income 
in the second quarter  the settlement of these instruments resulted in a gain of million after tax  which was recorded in other comprehensive income 
in the third quarter  the company entered into and settled two forward starting swap contracts 
the purpose of the forward starting swap contracts was to hedge a debt offering of million that was priced on september  pse paid million to the counterparties when the contracts were settled 
the forward starting swap contracts were designated and documented under sfas no 
criteria as cash flow hedges  with all changes in market value being presented net of tax in other comprehensive income 
in the third quarter  the settlement of these instruments resulted in a loss of million after tax  which was recorded in other comprehensive income 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the loss will be amortized out of other comprehensive income to current earnings as an increase to interest expense over the life of the new debt issued 
the ending balance in other comprehensive income related to settled swaps contracts at december  was a net loss of million after tax and accumulated amortization 
this compares to a loss of million in other comprehensive income after tax and accumulated amortization at december  all financial hedge contracts of this type are reviewed by senior management and presented to the securities pricing committee of the board of directors and are approved prior to execution
