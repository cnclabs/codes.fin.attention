item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth in the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we believe that we are the leading provider of radiology services to radiology groups and hospitals across the united states 
our team of american board of radiology certified  us state licensed and hospital privileged radiologists uses our proprietary workflow technology to provide radiological interpretations to our customers primarily from centralized reading facilities located in sydney  australia  zurich  switzerland and the united states 
nighthawk radiology services  llc  an idaho limited liability company  was founded in august and began providing off hours emergency radiology services in october on march   our management team  along with entities affiliated with summit partners  consummated a series of related transactions that resulted in the creation and capitalization of nighthawk radiology holdings  inc  a delaware corporation  and its acquisition of all the outstanding membership units of nighthawk radiology services  llc 
these transactions resulted in nighthawk radiology services  llc becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of nighthawk radiology holdings  inc nighthawk radiology holdings  inc conducts its operations primarily through nighthawk radiology services  llc 
on february   a registration statement relating to our initial public offering of our common stock was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission 
under this registration statement  we registered the issuance of  shares of our common stock  and another  shares of our common stock sold by certain selling stockholders 
all  shares of common stock issued pursuant to the registration statement  including the  shares sold by the selling stockholders  were sold at a price to the public of per share 
executive summary and highlights acquisition of teleradiology diagnostic service  inc on february   we acquired teleradiology diagnostic service  inc  or tds 
we regard the acquisition of tds as a strategic acquisition of an off hours teleradiology business that is supplemental to our current business and that expands our presence in california 
we purchased tds for an aggregate price of million dollars  which was paid in cash at the closing of the acquisition 
acquisition of american teleradiology nighthawks  inc on september   we acquired american teleradiology nighthawks  inc  or atn 
we regard the atn acquisition as an acquisition of an off hours teleradiology business that is supplemental to our current business  and an early stage teleradiology business that will continue to focus on partnering with radiologists in order to supplement the services they provide to their hospitals 
the consideration to the atn stockholders in connection with the acquisition was based primarily upon the future financial performance of these two businesses 
specifically  the consideration to the stockholders of atn consists of  shares of our common stock issued on september    was recorded as additional consideration in september  to be issued as an estimated  shares of our common stock to stockholders of atn as of the acquisition date 
the additional 
table of contents consideration was calculated in accordance with the provisions of the purchase agreement as the amount equal to a the quotient obtained by dividing i revenue generated by the off hours teleradiology business from atn customers during the twelve month period ended september  by ii which was the value per share of company common stock on the date of completion of the acquisition as agreed by the parties minus b  which was the number of shares of company common stock issued to the stockholders of atn at the completion of the acquisition 
the contingent consideration ultimately due is subject to agreement by the former stockholders and company management 
additional shares of company common stock that may be issued in an amount equal to the sum of a the quotient obtained by dividing i earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  generated by the hospital business during the twelve month period ending march  by ii  which was the value per share of company common stock on the date of completion of the acquisition as agreed by the parties  plus b the quotient obtained by dividing a three times x the ebitda amount described in clause i by b the fair market value of company common stock  determined on a per share basis  on march  the  shares of common stock that were issued at the completion of the acquisition were recorded at par value as common stock with additional amounts up to fair value recorded as additional paid in capital 
the shares that may be issued as a result of the future financial performance of atn are considered contingent consideration and will be recorded in a similar manner upon resolution of the contingency 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during a fiscal period 
the sec considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations  and if it requires the exercise of significant judgment and the use of estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this report 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate  actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgment and estimates about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation  use of estimates  accounting for redeemable preferred stock  long lived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible assets  and income taxes 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected 
see risk factors for certain matters that may affect our future results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we enter into services contracts with our customers that typically have a one year term  and automatically renew for each successive year unless terminated by the customer or by us 
the amount we charge for our radiology services varies by customer based on a number of factors  including the hours of coverage we provide for the customer  the number of reads we provide to the customer and the technical and administrative services we provide to the customer 
we recognize revenue when we have satisfied all of our significant contractual obligations to our customers and we determine that the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue from services is recognized in the fiscal month in which the radiological interpretation is complete and forwarded to the customer 
we review our historical collection experience on a quarterly basis to determine the necessity of a provision for doubtful accounts 
as of december   we had reserved approximately million for doubtful accounts based on our estimate of the collectibility of outstanding receivables as of that date 
stock based compensation physician stock based compensation 
the company records share based compensation expense in connection with any grant of stock options  restricted stock units  or other issuance of shares of common stock to our affiliated radiologists 
we calculate the share based compensation expense associated with the issuance of stock options to our affiliated radiologists in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r and emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services eitf no 
 by determining the fair value using a black scholes model 
in accordance with eitf no 
 because our radiologists are treated as independent contractors and not as employees  we calculate the fair value of the share based compensation expense in each period 
the expense amount is determined by calculating the fair value of the shares earned in each period and recording that amount as expense during such period 
if the price of our common stock increases over a given period  this accounting treatment results in compensation expense that exceeds the expense we would have recorded if these individuals were employees 
stock based compensation to our affiliated radiologists is included in professional services expense 
non physician stock based compensation 
we also record stock based compensation expense in connection with any grant of stock options  restricted stock units  warrants or other issuance of shares of common stock to employees  directors and non physician contractors 
we calculate the stock based compensation expense associated with the issuance of stock options and warrants to our employees  directors and non physician contractors in accordance with sfas no 
r by determining the fair value using a black scholes model 
we calculate the stock based compensation expense related to the issuance of restricted stock units or shares of our common stock to our employees  directors and non physician contractors based on the fair value of our common stock on the date the restricted stock units or shares are issued 
stock based compensation to employees and non physician contractors is included in sales  general and administrative expense 
determination of fair value of our stock options 
as indicated above  we record stock based compensation expense associated with our stock options in accordance with sfas no 
r and eitf no 
 as applicable  which require us to calculate the expense associated with our stock options by determining the fair value of the options 
to determine the fair value of our stock options  the company uses a black scholes model which takes into account the exercise price of the stock option  the fair value of the common stock underlying the stock option  as measured on the date of grant or at each reporting date for grants to non employees that require future service  and an estimation of the volatility of the common stock underlying the stock option 
use of estimates on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates relating to the items described below 
we generally base our estimates on our historical experience which is limited and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable along with the guidance provided by statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
 accounting for contingencies  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 

table of contents accounts receivable allowance 
we monitor customer payments and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to make required payments 
in estimating the reserve  we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable from a specific customer when we become aware of circumstances that may impair the customer s ability to meet its financial obligations and record an allowance against amounts due 
to date  we have not experienced any material difficulties in collecting payments from our customers and only began maintaining a reserve for customer nonpayment during we believe that the potential aggregate amount of nonpayment by our customers is limited in part by the frequency of our billing cycle and the ease with which we may discontinue service to customers during periods of nonpayment 
however  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates due to our limited experience in establishing reserves for nonpayment  our limited history of non collection  and the difficulty in predicting the future payment practices of a large number of customers 
fair value of redeemable preferred stock conversion feature 
prior to the date of our initial public offering  our estimates of the fair value of our redeemable preferred stock conversion feature were determined by management with the assistance of an independent valuation specialist 
however  because our outstanding redeemable preferred stock converted into common stock at the closing of our initial public offering  we have not and will not record any additional charges associated with the change in fair value of the conversion feature after such date 
as a result  since the closing of our initial public offering  we are no longer required to make these estimates 
loss contingency for medical liability claims 
we record a loss contingency for a medical liability claim in the month in which we deem such liability to be probable 
our determination of the probability of the liability is based upon a review of the claim by our executive staff  legal counsel and insurance carrier 
upon the determination that the liability is probable  we record a loss contingency for the claim up to the amount of the deductible specified in our medical liability insurance policy 
to date  we have not experienced any liabilities for claims that were in excess of our prior loss contingency estimates for such claims 
however  actual future losses from medical liability claims may differ from our estimates to the extent that we suffer an adverse determination for a claim that we did not deem the liability probable  did not record a loss contingency up to the maximum amount of our insurance deductible  or do not have insurance coverage 
incurred but not reported claims 
the company uses actuarial assumptions to estimate and record a liability for incurred but not reported ibnr professional liability claims and engaged an external actuarial firm to assist in the calculation of these estimates 
our estimated ibnr liability is based on long term industry trends and averages  and considers a number of factors  including changes in claim reporting patterns  claim settlement patterns  judicial decisions  and legislation and economic decisions 
our estimated ibnr liability will fluctuate if claims experience changes over time 
accounting for redeemable preferred stock we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we record derivative financial instruments as assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  measured at fair value 
we record the change in fair value of such instruments as non cash gains or losses in our consolidated statements of operations 
we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading purposes 
on march   in connection with the organization and capitalization of nighthawk radiology holdings  inc  we issued  shares of redeemable preferred stock for a total consideration of million 
each share of redeemable preferred stock was convertible  at the option of the holder  into one share of common stock 
the conversion feature of the redeemable preferred stock was considered an embedded derivative under the provisions of sfas no 
 and accordingly was accounted for separately from the redeemable preferred stock 
we determined the fair value of the redeemable preferred stock conversion feature based upon the fair value of the underlying common stock 
on the date of issuance  the estimated fair value of the conversion 
table of contents feature was approximately million which was recorded as a liability on the date of issuance  thus reducing the recorded value of the redeemable preferred stock to approximately million 
at each balance sheet date  we adjusted the carrying value of the embedded derivative to estimated fair value and recognized the change in such estimated value in our consolidated statements of operations 
we also classified the redeemable preferred stock as mezzanine equity 
as such  we accreted the carrying value of such stock to its redemption value using the effective interest method through the redemption period 
in addition  the redeemable preferred stock accrued dividends since the date of issuance 
we recognized these two types of accretion of redeemable preferred stock in our consolidated statement of operations as a decrease in net income available to common stockholders 
at the closing of our initial public offering  all outstanding shares of redeemable preferred stock converted into common stock 
as a result  beginning at the closing of the initial public offering we have not recorded any additional charge associated with the change in fair value of the conversion feature 
effective february   the amount reported as fair value of the redeemable preferred stock conversion feature was reclassified to additional paid in capital in the equity section of the balance sheet 
also  the rights of the holders of redeemable preferred stock to receive accrued dividends or to exercise redemption rights terminated 
as a result  the accretion of redeemable preferred stock also terminated 
these amounts were reclassified to stockholders equity 
long lived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible assets the value of goodwill and intangible assets is stated at the lower of cost or fair value 
goodwill is not subject to amortization  however it is subject to periodic impairment assessments 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to perform at least annually an impairment test and to consider other indicators that may arise throughout the year to re evaluate carrying value 
some factors we consider important  which could trigger an interim impairment review  include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or intangible assets have been impaired  we reduce goodwill and intangible assets by recording an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of operations in an amount equal to the amount that book value exceeds fair value at the date impairment is determined 
we perform our annual impairment test in the last quarter of each fiscal year 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we amortize our acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from seven months to ten years 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires impairment losses to be recognized for long lived assets through operations when indicators of impairment exist and the underlying cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset s carrying value 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that a long lived asset disposal group to be sold that meets certain recognition criteria be classified as held for sale and measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
sfas no 
also requires that a long lived asset subject to closure abandonment before the end of its previously estimated useful life continue to be classified as held and used until disposal  with depreciation estimates revised to reflect the use of the asset over its shortened useful life 
we regularly evaluate the carrying value of intangible and long lived assets for events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or that the remaining estimated useful life should be changed 
potential indicators of impairment can include  but are not limited to history of operating losses or expected future losses  significant adverse change in legal factors  changes in the 
table of contents extent or manner in which the assets are used  current expectations to dispose of the assets by sale or other means  and reductions or expected reductions of cash flow 
if we determine there is an indication of impairment  we compare undiscounted net cash flows to the carrying value of the respective asset 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows  we perform an impairment calculation using discounted cash flows  valuation analyses from independent valuation specialists or comparisons to recent sales or purchase transactions to determine estimated fair value 
income taxes as a limited liability company  or llc  for all periods from inception through march   we were not subject to federal income taxes directly 
rather  the llc members were subject to federal income taxation based on their respective allocation of the llc s net taxable income or loss 
since our recapitalization  we have recognized income taxes under the asset and liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
developing our provision for income taxes  including our effective tax rate and analysis of potential tax exposure items  if any  requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any estimated valuation allowances we deem necessary to value deferred tax assets 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
how we generate revenue we generate substantially all of our revenue from the radiology services that we provide our customers 
we typically provide these services pursuant to one year services contracts that automatically renew for each successive year unless terminated by the customer or by us 
the amount we charge for our radiology services varies by customer based upon a number of factors  including the hours of coverage we provide for the customer  the number of reads we provide to the customer and the technical and administrative services we provide to the customer 
we recognize revenue generated by our services during the month in which services are provided and we bill our customers at the beginning of the following month 
because the invoices are paid directly by our customers  we do not currently depend upon payment by third party payors or patients 
since our first full year of operations  we have experienced significant revenue growth  from million in to million in this growth in service revenue resulted primarily from an increase in our customer base  an increase in utilization of our service by our customers  an expansion of our service hours  a high customer retention rate  and our acquisition of atn in september and dayhawk in november as of december   our affiliated radiologists provided services to customers serving  hospitals 
the total number of hospitals we cover represents approximately of all hospitals in the united states 

table of contents our operating expenses our operating expenses consist primarily of professional services expense  sales  general and administrative expense  interest expense and income tax expense 
we record stock compensation expense in connection with equity issuances to our affiliated radiologists which we refer to as physician stock based compensation and in connection with equity issuances to our employees  directors and non physician contractors which we refer to as non physician stock based compensation 
in our consolidated statement of income  we present our physician stock based compensation expense as part of our professional services expenses and our non physician stock based compensation as part of our sales  general and administrative expense 
professional services expense 
our professional services expense consists primarily of the fees we pay to our affiliated radiologists for their services which we refer to as professional service fees  physician stock based compensation  the premiums we pay for medical liability insurance and medical liability loss contingency expense 
our affiliated radiologists are highly trained professionals and we compensate them accordingly 
as a result  our professional service fees are our most significant expense 
we structure our relationships with our affiliated radiologists such that they have control over the number of hours that they work 
we pay our affiliated radiologists using a formula that is generally based upon the number of hours worked and the workload completed  and we also provide discretionary bonuses 
we recognize professional service fee expense in the month in which the professional services are performed 
malpractice expense 
we recognize expenses associated with medical liability premiums in the month in which the expense is incurred 
the company records reserves for both reported and incurred but not reported ibnr amounts 
reported amounts are reserved based upon the company s best estimate of future probable costs 
ibnr claims are estimated by a third party actuary using historical claims information received by our third party claims administrator and industry indices 
this reserve is intended to cover potential medical claims that might arise related to the radiological interpretations performed by our affiliated radiologists 
physician stock based compensation expense 
as described previously  we record physician stock based compensation expense in connection with any stock options  restricted stock units or other issuance of shares of our common stock to our affiliated radiologists and present this expense in our consolidated statements of operations as part of our professional services expense 
we calculate the stock based compensation expense associated with the issuance of stock options and warrants to affiliated radiologists in accordance with sfas no 
r and eitf no 
sales  general and administrative expense 
sales  general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for all employees and non physician contractors  non physician stock based compensation  information technology and telecommunications expenses  costs associated with licensing and privileging our affiliated radiologists  facilities and office related expenses  sales and marketing expenses and other general and administrative expenses 
non physician stock based compensation expense 
as described previously  we record non physician stock based compensation expense in connection with any grant of stock options  restricted stock units  warrants or other issuance of shares of our common stock to our employees  directors and non physician contractors and present this expense in our consolidated statement of income as part of our sales  general and administrative expense 
we calculate the stock based compensation expense associated with the issuance of stock options and warrants to our employees  directors and non physician contractors in accordance with sfas no 
r 
our non operating expenses in addition to our operating expenses  we record the following non operating expenses 
interest expense 
the interest expense we incur in a given period is directly attributable to the principal amount of debt we have outstanding during such period 

table of contents change in fair value of redeemable preferred stock conversion feature 
we entered into a stockholders agreement with the holders of our series a preferred stock pursuant to which we agreed to repurchase all or any portion of the shares of redeemable preferred stock then held by such holders at any time after seven years from the date of issuance 
the redemption provision in the stockholders agreement  which terminated upon the closing of our initial public offering  provided that the repurchase price for such shares of redeemable preferred stock would be the greater of i the market value of the common stock issuable upon conversion of the redeemable preferred stock or ii the liquidation value of such shares of redeemable preferred stock including all accrued and unpaid dividends 
the conversion feature of the redeemable preferred stock was considered an embedded derivative under the provisions of sfas no 
 and accordingly was accounted for separately from the redeemable preferred stock 
on the date of issuance  the estimated fair value of the conversion feature was million which was recorded as a liability on the balance sheet date on the date of issue thus reducing the recorded value of the redeemable preferred stock to million 
while these shares remained outstanding  on each balance sheet date subsequent to the execution of that agreement  we adjusted the carrying value of the embedded derivative to estimated fair value and recognized the change in such estimated value in our consolidated statements of operations 
at the closing of our initial public offering  all outstanding shares of redeemable preferred stock converted into shares of common stock  and  as a result  we have not recorded any additional expenses associated with the change in fair value of the conversion feature of our redeemable preferred stock after such date 
income tax expense 
we recognize income taxes under the asset and liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
redeemable preferred stock accretion 
shares of our redeemable preferred stock accrued dividends from the date of issuance until their conversion into shares of common stock at the closing of our initial public offering 
the redeemable preferred stock dividends were cumulative and accrued at a rate of per annum based on the sum of the liquidation value of each share of redeemable preferred stock   plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends 
dividends accumulated at the end of each calendar quarter 
in addition to accruing dividends  we also accrued the carrying amount of the redeemable preferred stock to its redemption value using the effective interest method through the redemption period 
we recognized these two types of accretion of redeemable preferred stock in our consolidated statements of operations as a decrease in net income available to common stockholders 
at the closing of our initial public offering  all outstanding shares of redeemable preferred stock converted into shares of common stock and the rights of the holders of redeemable preferred stock to receive accrued dividends or to exercise redemption rights terminated 
as a result  the accretion relating to our redeemable preferred stock also terminated 
these amounts are now reported within stockholders equity 
trends in our business and results of operations revenue trends 
our business has grown rapidly since inception 
this growth has been driven primarily by an increase in our customer base  an increase in utilization of our service by our customers  an expansion of our service hours  a high customer retention rate and the growth in the use of diagnostic imaging technologies and procedures in the healthcare market 
our strategy is to expand on our position as the leading provider of radiology services by expanding our radiology group customers utilization of our services as they implement coverage of additional hospitals  expanding our service offerings to include final and subspecialty interpretations and cardiac imaging services  
table of contents targeting new customers  marketing to our customers the additional available hours of coverage  pursuing strategic acquisitions  and developing markets for our data and technology solutions 
our revenue has increased in absolute dollars each year since inception and our revenue growth rate has been strong 
however  our revenue growth rate declined from to when compared with our growth rate from to and the rate of growth will likely continue to decline as a result of the increased revenue base against which future periods will be compared 
we expect that a number of our customers will implement our new service offerings  continue to implement coverage for additional hospitals as well as continue to use additional hours of our service  resulting in an overall increase in the utilization of our service by those customers 
historically  we have seen an increase in same site volumes during the second and third quarters of each fiscal year  when weather conditions tend to be warmer in much of the united states 
we believe these increases are a result of increased outdoor and transportation activities during summer months 
during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year  when weather conditions are colder for a large portion of the united states  we have historically experienced relatively lower same site volumes than those experienced during the second and third quarters 
we expect this seasonality to continue 
trends in professional service fees 
since inception  our professional service fees have increased in absolute dollars each year  primarily due to the addition of new radiologists to perform an increased workload as our business has grown 
we expect that our professional service fees will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we contract with additional radiologists to meet the increasing demand for our services  as we begin to offer additional services  and as a result of scheduled increases in hourly fees under our existing agreements with our affiliated radiologists 
trends in medical liability expense 
our medical liability expense has also increased in absolute dollars each year since inception  primarily due to increases in our medical liability premiums as our business has grown and our ability to forecast claim experience not yet reported has developed 
we expect our medical liability premiums and our ibnr expense to continue to increase in future periods as our business grows 
in addition  if we have claims in future periods for which we deem a liability to be probable  our medical liability expense may increase 
trends in physician stock based compensation expense 
the amount of physician stock based compensation expense we record in a given period depends primarily on the number of shares subject to outstanding options held by our affiliated radiologists  the amount of hours worked  and the change in the value of our common stock in that period 
because of the accounting treatment required by eitf  if the value of our common stock increases over a given period  we will record a compensation expense that generally exceeds the expense we would have recorded if these individuals were employees because eitf requires us to record the increase in the value of the option during such period as an expense 
as a result  because of the relatively significant increase in value of our common stock during the first quarter of primarily as a result of our initial public offering  we recorded significant physician stock based compensation expense in when compared to our expense in future periods for physician stock based compensation will be driven primarily by new equity based grants we make to our affiliated radiologists  the rate at which those equity awards and the currently outstanding options are earned over such periods  as well as changes  if any  in our stock price during such periods 
trends in sales  general and administrative expense 
our sales  general and administrative expense has increased in absolute dollars each year since inception primarily as a result of increased payroll expenses in connection with the addition of key management personnel  software development professionals and the implementation of executive and employee bonuses 
we expect that these payroll expenses will continue to 
table of contents increase as we continue to increase headcount at all levels as our business continues to grow 
in addition to increased payroll expense  we expect that our general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars due to increases in telecommunications and information technology costs and licensing and privileging costs 
also  we expect that our general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars due to increases in facilities expenses related to our offices in san francisco  california and austin  texas and increases in legal  accounting  consulting  staffing and insurance costs associated with being a public company 
accordingly  we expect sales  general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
trends in non physician stock based compensation expense 
in june  our board of directors agreed to accelerate the vesting of the  shares of common stock held by one of our former directors which resulted in a non physician stock based compensation expense of approximately million  which contributed to a relatively significant non physician stock based compensation expense in although our non physician stock based compensation expense was only of revenue for  as we continue to grant options and restricted stock units to our employees  directors and non physician contractors  we expect our non physician stock based compensation expense to increase in future periods 
trends in interest expense 
for and first quarter of our interest expense was attributable to the principal amount of debt we had outstanding primarily as a result of a loan agreement with comerica bank 
pursuant to this loan agreement  we borrowed an aggregate of million at various times throughout and the first quarter of we used the proceeds from this loan facility in part to repay previously existing debt and in part to fund a special distribution of million to the holders of our then outstanding common stock and redeemable preferred stock 
we repaid all of this indebtedness on february  with a portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering 
trends in interest income 
in february  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock from which we received net proceeds of million after deducting underwriter discounts and commissions and approximately million in offering costs 
of this amount  we invested approximately million in a mix of highly liquid  investment grade securities and cash  primarily consisting of securities issued by us government and federal agencies along with money market accounts and municipal securities 
we expect this amount to decrease in future periods as we utilize a portion of these securities to fund acquisitions and expansion of operations 
trends and treatment of redeemable preferred stock 
upon the closing of our initial public offering  all outstanding shares of redeemable preferred stock converted into shares of common stock and the rights of the holders of redeemable preferred stock to receive accrued dividends or to exercise redemption rights terminated 
as a result  since the date of the closing of our initial public offering  we have not recorded any additional expenses associated with the change in fair value of the conversion feature of our redeemable preferred stock  and the accretion relating to our redeemable preferred stock has terminated

the number of radiology group and hospital customers to which we provided service increased from as of december  to as of december   a increase in 
table of contents customers  and the number of hospital sites to which we provided service increased from as of december  to  as of december   a increase 
the increase in the number of our customers and hospitals served resulted primarily from increased market acceptance of teleradiology as a solution  an increase in the recognition by the marketplace of the quality of our service offerings  the success by our sales professionals in generating new customers  and an improvement in our ability to meet the increased demand for our service  primarily through the addition of affiliated radiologists and the expansion of our hours of service

the changes in our operating assets and liabilities  net of acquisitions  and the associated impacts on our net cash from operations during the fiscal year ended december  as compared to the changes during the fiscal year ended december  are primarily due to the following factors accounts receivable 
accounts receivable increased by million during the twelve months ended december  compared to a million increase during the twelve months ended december  increases in accounts receivable decrease cash from operations 
this change was attributable 
table of contents primarily to increased service revenues during the year ended december   offset by a decrease in our days sales outstanding  or dso  from to we calculate our dso based upon a three month average of accounts receivable and revenue 
the decrease in our dso was primarily due to improved turnaround of invoicing associated with our implementation of an automated billing system 
we completed implementation of this automated billing process in september and believe it  together with an increased focus on the collection process  has enabled us to prepare and deliver invoices more quickly 
accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased by million during the year ended december  compared to a million increase during the year ended december  increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses increase cash from operations 
this increase was primarily due to the expansion of our operations and the recording of additional malpractice reserves 
prepaid expenses and other assets 
our prepaid expense and other assets increased by million during the year ended december  compared to an increase of million during the year ended december  increases in prepaid expenses and other assets decrease cash from operations 
this change was due primarily to an increase in prepaid income taxes and accrued interest receivable 
deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes increased by approximately million during the year ended december  compared to an increase of approximately million during the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to an increase in reserves and non deductible stock compensation expense in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  investments in marketable securities with maturities greater than ninety days are classified as investing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows 
this increase in net cash used in investing activities over this period resulted primarily from the purchase of million in marketable securities from a portion of the net cash proceeds received from our initial public offering 
we also received million as a result of certain of our investments reaching maturity during the year ended december  we also invested approximately million in property and equipment during each of the years ended december  and the majority of these capital expenditures were associated with purchases of equipment and the continued investment in our information technology infrastructure 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  during the first quarter of we completed our initial public offering from which we received net proceeds of million after deducting discounts and commissions paid to our underwriters and approximately million in stock issuance costs paid during the year

table of contents security agreement  the proceeds from which we used to repay all outstanding indebtedness under the promissory notes held by entities affiliated with summit partners and the revolving credit facility with silicon valley bank

we borrowed an aggregate of million under our term facility and distributed the amount as a special dividend to our common and preferred stockholders 
financial condition and liquidity we expect our long term liquidity needs to consist primarily of working capital  capital expenditure requirements and future acquisitions 
we intend to fund these long term liquidity needs from cash generated from operations 
however  our ability to generate cash is subject to our performance  general economic conditions  industry trends and other factors 
many of these factors are beyond our control and cannot be anticipated at this time 
to the extent that funds generated by our initial public offering  together with existing cash and securities and cash from operations  are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
if additional funds are obtained by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
other than our agreement with atn and our recently closed acquisition of teleradiology diagnostic service  inc  we do not currently have any obligations pursuant to any agreement or binding letter of intent with respect to potential investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  services or technologies

because we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange risk  we have not  to date  entered into any hedging contracts 
if a weakening us dollar requires us to increase the amounts we pay to our affiliated radiologists in the future in order to maintain a constant level of compensation denominated in us dollars  our results of operations and cash flows could be affected 
any foreign exchange risks are related to the foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and the australian dollar and between the us dollar and the swiss franc

additionally  we had marketable securities totaling million at december  invested primarily in us government agency securities and municipal securities

we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates
