overview select comfort is the leading developer  manufacturer and marketer of premium quality  adjustable firmness beds 
the air chamber technology of our proprietary sleep number bed allows adjustable firmness on each side of the mattress and provides a sleep surface that is clinically proven to provide better sleep quality and greater relief of back pain compared to traditional mattress products 
in addition  we market and sell accessories and other sleep related products which focus on providing personalized comfort to complement the sleep number bed and provide a better night s sleep to the consumer 
we generate revenue by selling our products through four complementary distribution channels 
three of these channels retail  direct marketing and e commerce  are company controlled and sell directly to consumers 
our wholesale channel sells to leading home furnishings retailers  specialty bedding retailers  the qvc shopping channel and to several end users such as radisson hotels and resorts 
the proportion of our total net sales  by dollar volume  from each of our channels during the last three years is summarized as follows retail direct e commerce wholesale total the components of total sales growth  including comparable store sales increases  are as follows channel increase channel increase channel increase retail comparable store sales new closed stores  net retail total direct e commerce wholesale total sales growth stores are included in the comparable store calculation in the th full month of operation 
stores that have been remodeled or relocated within the same shopping center remains in the comparable store base 

table of contents the number of company operated retail stores during the last three years  and independently owned and operated retail partner stores are summarized as follows company owned retail stores beginning of year opened closed end of year retail partner stores we anticipate opening net new retail stores and to relocate or expand or more stores in we expect the number of stores in our retail partner program to remain at approximately in our growth plans are centered on increasing market by market awareness of our products and stores through expansion of media  increasing distribution primarily through new retail store openings and supplemented with sales through other mattress retailers  and through improvement and expansion of our product lines 
our primary market consists of the sale of products directly to consumers in the us we believe long term opportunities exist for international sales 
in december  we entered the canadian market through a retail partner with locations in major metropolitan markets 
sales growth and a higher gross profit rate enabled us to increase operating income by in historically  the majority of our operating margin improvement has been generated through leverage in selling expenses increased sales through the existing store base and leverage of our existing infrastructure general and administrative expenses 
we expect any future improvements in operating margin to be derived from similar sources 
our long term growth targets are to sustain annual sales growth rates of or more and annual earnings growth rates of or more 
we expect a challenging economic environment in which may affect our ability to achieve these targets in 
table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our results of operations expressed as dollars and percentages of net sales 
figures are in millions except percentages and earnings per share amounts

of net sales of net sales of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative research and development asset impairment charges total operating expenses operating income interest income income before income taxes income tax expense net income net income per share basic diluted weighted average number of common shares basic diluted net sales we recognize revenue when the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and title passes 
we reduce sales at the time revenue is recognized for estimated returns 
this estimate is based on historical return rates  which are reasonably consistent from period to period  and adjusted for any current trends as appropriate 
if actual returns vary from expected rates  revenue in future periods is adjusted 
historically  we have not experienced material adjustments to the financial statements due to changes to estimates of returns 
cost of sales cost of sales includes costs associated with purchasing  manufacturing  shipping  handling and delivering our products to our customers  including related occupancy and depreciation expenses 
cost of sales also includes estimated costs to service warranty claims of customers 
this estimate is based on historical claim rates experienced during the warranty period and adjusted for any current trends as appropriate 
because this estimate covers an extended period of time  a revision of estimated claim rates could result in a significant adjustment of estimated future costs of fulfilling warranty commitments and could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 
we revise our estimates of warranty liabilities to reflect changes in projected claim rates and projected costs of fulfilling warranty claims 
however  these estimate revisions have not historically materially affected our annual results 
gross profit our gross profit margin is dependent on a number of factors and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
these factors include the mix of products sold  the level at which we offer promotional discounts to purchase our products  the cost of materials  delivery and manufacturing and the mix of sales between wholesale and company controlled distribution channels 
sales of products manufactured by third parties  such as accessories and our adjustable foundation  generate lower gross margins 
similarly  sales directly to consumers through company controlled channels typically generate higher gross margins than sales through our wholesale channels because we capture both the manufacturer s and retailer s margin 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses include advertising and media production  other marketing and selling materials such as brochures  videos  customer mailings and in store signage  sales compensation  customer service  store occupancy costs and related depreciation expense 
advertising expense was million in  million in  and million in future advertising expenditures will depend on the effectiveness and efficiency of the advertising in creating awareness of our products and brand names  generating consumer inquiries and driving consumer traffic to our points of sale 
we anticipate that full year advertising expenditures in will increase by approximately 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist of costs associated with management of functional areas  including information technology  human resources  finance  sales and marketing administration  investor relations and risk management 
costs include salaries  bonus and benefits  information hardware  software and maintenance  office facilities  insurance  investor relations costs and other overhead 
research and development expenses research and development r d expenses includes internal labor and benefits  outside consulting services and testing equipment 
r d spending is expected to increase by up to in as we accelerate our innovation  leading with a series of cost and quality enhancements for our products 
asset impairment charges asset impairment charges relate to long lived assets that have been written off when the carrying amount of an asset is not expected to be recoverable from future cash flows 
we evaluate our long lived assets  including leaseholds and fixtures in existing stores  based on estimated future cash flows after considering the potential impact of planned operational improvements  marketing programs  industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
expected cash flows may not be realized  which could cause long lived assets to become impaired in future periods and could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 
quarterly and annual operating results quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including increases or decreases in comparable store sales  the timing  amount and effectiveness of advertising expenditures  any changes in sales return rates or warranty experience  the timing of new store openings and related expenses  net sales contributed by new stores  the timing of promotional offerings  competitive factors  rising commodity costs  any disruptions in supplies or third party services  seasonality of retail sales  timing of qvc shows and wholesale sales  consumer confidence and general economic conditions 
furthermore  a substantial portion of net sales is often realized in the last month of a quarter  due in part to our promotional schedule and commission structure 
as a result  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner and our business  financial condition and operating results may be significantly impacted 
our historical results of operations may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for any future period 
comparison of and net sales net sales in increased to million from million in sales of mattress units increased overall  and the average selling price per bed mattress sales divided by mattress units in our company controlled channels increased to  while sales of other products and services increased by

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  of which million was classified as a current asset compared to million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december   of which million was classified as a current asset 
the million decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities was the result of million of cash provided by operating activities  reduced by million of capital expenditures and million of cash used in financing activities which included million of repurchases of our common stock  net of cash from stock option exercises and related tax benefits 
we generated cash from operations of million in cash from operations for is comprised of net income of million  plus adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities of million  and a decrease in cash from changes in assets and liabilities of million  due primarily to increases in accounts receivable and inventory combined with decreases in customer prepayments and accrued compensation and benefits  partially offset by increases in accounts payable

net cash used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities was principally due to a million increase in capital expenditures 
in both periods  our capital expenditures were primarily related to new and remodeled retail stores and investments in information technology 
in  we opened new stores and remodeled retail stores  while in we opened new stores and remodeled retail stores 
we anticipate increasing our retail store count by net new retail stores during  and relocating or expanding or more stores in we will fund planned capital expenditures with cash on hand and cash generated from operations 
we expect our new stores to be cash flow positive within the first months of operations and  as a result  do not anticipate a negative effect on net cash needs 
our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million  compared to million in the increase in capital expenditures is due to our expected implementation of sap in the first half of fiscal year and leasehold improvement costs necessary to furnish our new corporate headquarters that we plan to move into in the fall of net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to million in the million increase in cash used in financing activities resulted from a million increase in repurchases of our common stock  offset by the change in the classification of the excess tax benefits from stock option exercises of million from operating to financing in accordance with adoption of sfas r in the use of cash for financing activities in both and was principally due to repurchases of our common stock of million in and million in we may make additional purchases of our common stock  subject to market conditions and at prevailing market prices  through open market purchases 
the total outstanding stock repurchase authorization at february  was million 
we may terminate or limit the stock repurchase program at any time 
cash generated from operations should be a sufficient source of liquidity for the short and long term and should provide adequate funding for capital expenditures 
in addition  our business model  which can operate with minimal working capital  does not require significant additional capital to fund operations and organic growth 
in  we obtained a million bank revolving line of credit for general corporate purposes including the funding of any short term cash needs or investment opportunities 
this line of credit is a five year senior unsecured revolving facility expiring june borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a floating rate and may be maintained as base rate loans tied to the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus or as eurocurrency rate loans tied to libor  plus a margin up to depending on our leverage ratio  as defined 
we are subject to certain financial covenants under the agreement  principally consisting of interest coverage and leverage ratios
