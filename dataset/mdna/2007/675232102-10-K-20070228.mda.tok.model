executive overview the table that follows sets out our revenue and profitability for the years ended december   and year ended december  dollars in thousands revenue gross margin gross margin operating income operating income net income 
table of contents we generate of our revenue from our services and products provided to the oil and gas industry 
in  we increased revenue by  led by our subsea products up  rov up and subsea projects up segments 
our subsea products segment revenue increased from sales of multiflex umbilicals and oceaneering intervention engineering specialty subsea products  particularly rov tooling  and clamps from our grayloc products division  which we acquired at the end of june our rov segment increase was primarily a result of an improvement in average pricing and growth in days on hire for our work class fleet 
our subsea projects segment continued to benefit from increased demand  which resulted in improved rates and high utilization for our seven vessels and diving assets 
the million consolidated net income we earned in was the highest in our history 
the million increase in results was attributable to higher profit contributions from all of our oilfield businesses  with each setting annual profit records 
the subsea products and rov improvements reflect our strategic focus on deepwater and subsea completion activity 
our subsea projects increase was due to demand increases for hurricane damage projects and deepwater infrastructure installation and inspection  repair  and maintenance irm work in the gulf of mexico 
our inspection growth was attributable to securing work with higher profit margins and controlling expenses 
including equity income from our investment in medusa spar llc  our mobile offshore production systems segment earned a record pre tax income contribution 
in  we invested in the following major capital projects additions of work class rovs  including placed into service during the year  purchase of equipment to increase capacity at our subsea products manufacturing facilities  purchase of an oil tanker for possible future conversion to a mobile offshore production and storage system in the event we obtain a suitable contract  beginning of construction of a saturation diving system for our subsea projects segment to meet growing demand  and commencement of upgrades of the dynamic positioning system and crane capacity of our vessel  the performer 
for  we expect earnings growth of about  led by increases in operating income in our subsea products and rov segments 
we believe that growth in our subsea products segment will be driven by a rise in the use of subsea completions 
historically  there has been a strong correlation between the number of annual subsea tree orders and the follow on of orders for umbilicals and other subsea specialty products that we provide 
the following table shows industry data and projections for worldwide subsea completion installations by decade 
number of subsea period completions s s s s s industry projection according to publicly available information published by quest offshore resources  inc  the projected global market for subsea tree orders in will be over trees  up from trees in industry wide umbilical orders in are forecast to increase to around  miles  up over from approximately miles in with the start up of our steel tube manufacturing line in our panama city  fl umbilical plant and expansion of our thermoplastic manufacturing capacity at our scotland plant  we are well positioned to secure a share of this work 
we use our rovs in the offshore oil and gas industry to perform a variety of underwater tasks  including drill support  installation and construction support  pipeline inspection and surveys and subsea production facility operation and maintenance 
the largest percentage of our rovs are usually used to provide drill support services 
therefore  
table of contents utilization of floating drilling rigs is a leading market indicator for this business 
the following table shows average floating rig use and our rov utilization 
average number of floating rigs in use rov days on hire in thousands rov utilization critical accounting policies and estimates we have based the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these principles require us to make various estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the periods we present 
we base our estimates on historical experience  available information and other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  however  our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following discussion summarizes the accounting policies we believe require our management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and are the most critical to our reporting of results of operations and financial position 
revenue recognition 
we recognize our revenue according to the type of contract involved 
on a daily basis  we recognize revenue under contracts that provide for specific time  material and equipment charges  which we bill periodically  ranging from weekly to monthly 
we account for significant fixed price contracts  which we enter into mainly in our subsea products and advanced technologies segments  and occasionally in our subsea projects segment  using the percentage of completion method 
in  we accounted for of our revenue using the percentage of completion method 
in determining whether a contract should be accounted for using the percentage of completion method  we consider whether the customer provides specifications for the construction of facilities or production of goods or for the provision of related services  we can reasonably estimate our progress towards completion and our costs  the contract includes provisions as to the enforceable rights regarding the goods or services to be provided  consideration to be received and the manner and terms of payment  the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract  and we can be expected to perform our contractual obligations 
under the percentage of completion method  we recognize estimated contract revenue based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs 
changes in the expected cost of materials and labor  productivity  scheduling and other factors affect the total estimated costs 
additionally  external factors  including weather or other factors outside of our control  may also affect the progress and estimated cost of a project s completion and  therefore  the timing of income and revenue recognition 
we routinely review estimates related to our contracts and reflect revisions to profitability in earnings immediately 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates an ultimate loss on a contract  we recognize the projected loss in full when we determine it 
in prior years  we have recorded adjustments to earnings as a result of revisions to contract estimates 
although we are continually striving to improve our ability to estimate our contract costs and profitability  adjustments to overall contract costs could be significant in future periods 
we recognize the remainder of our revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
long lived assets 
we evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be appropriate 
we base these evaluations on a comparison of the assets carrying values to forecasts of undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets or quoted market prices 
if an impairment has occurred  we recognize a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
our expectations regarding future sales and undiscounted cash flows are highly subjective  cover extended periods of time and depend on a number of factors outside our control  such as changes in general economic conditions  laws and regulations 
accordingly  these expectations could differ significantly from year to year 

table of contents in  we recorded million of additional depreciation in our rov segment 
these provisions related to the retirement of four vehicles and obsolete rov components 
in  our owned cable lay and maintenance joint venture recorded an impairment of million related to some of its equipment 
we also recorded an additional impairment of million of our investment 
after taking into account a deferred gain of million we had generated upon formation of the venture  the two impairments reduced our equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates by million in we expense the costs of repair and maintenance as we incur them  except for drydocking costs associated with our larger vessels 
we estimate and accrue these drydocking costs over a period of time in advance of future drydockings 
these amounts are included in accrued liabilities on our balance sheets 
we recognize differences between the estimates and actual costs incurred in the income statement 
effective january   as required by fasb staff position no 
aug air  accounting for planned major maintenance activities  we will no longer accrue drydock expense in advance  but we will charge drydocking expenses to the income statement as incurred 
while we are currently evaluating the impact of this staff position upon our financial statements  we do not believe there will be a material effect on our financial statements upon its adoption 
loss contingencies 
we self insure for workers compensation  maritime employer s liability and comprehensive general liability claims to levels we consider financially prudent and carry insurance for exposures beyond the self insurance levels  which can be by occurrence or in the aggregate 
we determine the level of accruals by reviewing our historical experience and current year claim activity 
we do not record accruals on a present value basis 
we review each claim with insurance adjusters and establish specific reserves for known liabilities 
we establish an additional reserve for incidents incurred but not reported to us for each year using our estimates and based on prior experience 
we believe we have established adequate accruals for uninsured expected liabilities arising from those obligations 
however  it is possible that future earnings could be affected by changes in our estimates relating to these matters 
we are involved in various claims and actions against us  most of which are covered by insurance 
we believe that our ultimate liability  if any  that may result from these claims and actions will not materially affect our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
income taxes 
our tax provisions are based on our expected taxable income  statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws 
we are at risk that a taxing authority s final determination of our tax liabilities may differ from our interpretation 
our effective tax rate may fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions  the amount of pre tax income fluctuates and our estimates regarding the realizability of items such as foreign tax credits may change 
in and  we recorded reductions of income tax expense of million and million  respectively  resulting from the resolution of tax contingencies related to certain foreign tax liabilities we recorded in prior years 
currently payable income tax expense represents either nonresident withholding taxes or the liabilities expected to be reflected on our income tax returns for the current year  while the net deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities as reported on our balance sheet 
we establish valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future 
while we have considered estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowances  changes in these estimates and assumptions  as well as changes in tax laws  could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets 
these adjustments to the valuation allowance would impact our income tax provision in the period in which such adjustments are identified and recorded

liquidity and capital resources we consider our liquidity and capital resources adequate to support our operations and internally generated growth initiatives 
at december   we had working capital of million  including cash of million 
additionally  we had million available under our revolving credit facility  which was scheduled to expire in january in january  we amended the revolving credit facility to million and to expire in january  thereby increasing our 
table of contents available credit by million and extending the duration of the facility by four years 
at december   our debt to total capitalization ratio was 
we expect our operating cash flow to meet our ongoing annual cash requirements  including debt service  for the foreseeable future 
our net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our capital expenditures  including business acquisitions  for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
our capital expenditures during included million in our rov segment  principally for additions and upgrades to our rov fleet to expand the fleet and replace older units we retired and for facilities infrastructure to support our growing rov fleet size 
we plan to continue adding rovs at levels we determine appropriate to meet market opportunities as they arise 
in  we commenced improvements in our subsea products facilities  including the addition of equipment to increase manufacturing capacity at our umbilical plant in the uk and our subsea valve facility in norway and purchased an oil tanker for possible future conversion to a mobile offshore production and storage system in the event we obtain a suitable contract 
we also began upgrades to a dynamically positioned vessel and began construction of a saturation diving system to meet demand in our subsea projects segment 
our capital expenditures during included the acquisition of grayloc for million and additions to our rov fleet to replace older units we retired and to increase the number of units 
our capital expenditures during included the acquisitions of work class rovs from stolt offshore sa and work class rovs from fugro nv these two acquisitions totaled million 
our other capital expenditures in included million to upgrade our umbilical plants in the us and brazil  other additions to our rov fleet to replace older units we retired and a new diving vessel 
in september  our board of directors approved a plan to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock  subject to a million aggregate purchase price limitation 
under this plan  we repurchased  shares of common stock through the year ended december   at a total cost of million 
through december   we had reissued all of these shares as contributions to our k plan or for exercised stock options under our incentive plans 
for a description of our incentive plans  please read note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have not guaranteed any debt not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
in december  we acquired a interest in medusa spar llc 
at formation  medusa spar llc borrowed million  or approximately of its total capitalization  from a group of banks 
the balance of the bank loan at december  was million  and it requires scheduled quarterly payments through the bank loan is secured by minimum throughput guarantees by the other investors in medusa spar llc 
we expect the minimum throughput guarantees will generate sufficient revenue for medusa spar llc to repay the bank loan 
we are under no obligation to provide medusa spar llc or the banks with additional funds to repay the loan 
the majority of the cash flow generated by medusa spar llc will be used to repay the bank loan until the loan is retired 
after that  the cash flow from medusa spar llc will be available for distribution to the equity holders 
we received million  million and million of cash distributions from medusa spar llc and recognized million  million and million of equity in the earnings of medusa spar llc in  and  respectively 
medusa spar llc is a variable interest entity under financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r fin no 
r 
as we are not the primary beneficiary of medusa spar llc  we are accounting for our investment in medusa spar llc using the equity method of accounting 
at december   our investment in medusa spar llc was million 
our principal source of cash from operating activities is our net income  adjusted for the non cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stock compensation under our restricted stock plan 
in  our million of cash provided from operating activities was net of million of increases in accounts receivable and million of increases in inventory and other current assets 
the increases in accounts receivable was due to an increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of the increases in inventory and other current assets principally related to raw materials and rov parts 
the raw materials increase related to preparations for building items reflected in our subsea products backlog  which increased more than over the level at december  the increase in rov parts inventory related to equipment waiting for assembly into rovs to be placed in service in and an increase in parts to be used for servicing our growing rov fleet 
in  our million of cash provided from operating activities was net of million of increases in accounts receivable and million of increases in inventory and other current assets 
the increase in accounts receivable was due to an increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of the increases in inventory and other current assets principally related to rov spare parts and raw materials 
the increase in rov parts inventory related to equipment waiting for assembly into rovs to be placed in service in and an increase in parts to be used for servicing our growing rov fleet 
the raw 
table of contents materials increase related to preparations for building items reflected in our subsea products backlog  which increased nearly over the level at december  in  we used million in investing activities  including million to modernize and add additional units to our rov fleet and million to add capacity to our subsea products facilities 
in  we used million in investing activities  including million related to business acquisitions  primarily grayloc  and million to modernize and add additional units and equipment to our rov business 
in and  we received million and million  respectively  in cash flow from financing activities as proceeds from the sale of our common stock  primarily pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options 
because of our significant foreign operations  we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange risks 
we generally minimize these risks primarily through matching  to the extent possible  revenue and expense in the various currencies in which we operate 
cumulative translation adjustments as of december  relate primarily to our permanent investments in and loans to our foreign subsidiaries 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk inflation has not had a material effect on our revenue or income from operations in the past three years  and no such effect is expected in the near future 
results of operations information on our business segments is shown in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
oil and gas 
the table that follows sets out revenue and profitability for the business segments within our oil and gas business for the years ended december   and 
table of contents year ended december  dollars in thousands remotely operated vehicles revenue gross margin gross margin operating income operating income utilization subsea products revenue gross margin gross margin operating income operating income subsea projects revenue gross margin gross margin operating income operating income inspection revenue gross margin gross margin operating income operating income mobile offshore production systems revenue gross margin gross margin operating income operating income total oil and gas revenue gross margin gross margin operating income operating income in response to continued increasing demand to support deepwater drilling and identified future construction and production maintenance work  we announced an rov fleet expansion program in  which focuses on building new rovs 
these new vehicles are designed for use around the world in water depths to  feet 
we have added over of these rovs to our fleet since that time 
we added rovs in while retiring six older units 
we plan to continue adding rovs at levels we determine appropriate to meet market opportunities as they arise 
for  our rov revenue increased over from an improvement in average pricing and growth in days on hire for our work class fleet 
operating income increased by over 
margin percentages increased  as included million of additional depreciation associated with the retirement of four older rovs and obsolete rov components 

table of contents for  our rov revenue increased over from higher utilization  a higher number of units available and higher average pricing 
margin percentages remained flat  as we incurred million of additional depreciation associated with the retirement of four older rovs and obsolete rov components 
we anticipate rov operating income to increase million to million in from a higher average fleet size and pricing 
our subsea products revenue in was higher than in  while gross margin and operating income percentages significantly improved 
we achieved higher sales of umbilicals and of our specialty hardware  and segment operating income nearly quadrupled 
during the year  we resolved the mechanical problems we previously experienced at our panama city  fl umbilical facility and we processed a higher workload at all three of our umbilical manufacturing plants 
the increase in sales of specialty hardware came particularly from rov tooling and clamps 
the increase in clamp sales was primarily attributable to the full year of operations from our grayloc division  which we acquired at the end of june our subsea products revenue in was higher than in  while gross margin and operating income percentages were relatively flat 
we achieved higher sales of our specialty hardware  particularly from sales of rov tooling  installation workover and control systems  valves and clamps 
the clamps are associated with our acquisition of grayloc at the end of june we anticipate our subsea products segment operating income will grow million to million in  driven by a continuation of a high level of subsea completion activity  which we expect will result in an improvement in our umbilical sales and a general increase in our specialty hardware sales 
our subsea products backlog increased to million at december  from million at december  in  our subsea projects segment had better results than due to work related to hurricane damage from hurricanes katrina and rita and an escalation in demand for installation projects and our inspection  maintenance and repair services on the deepwater infrastructure in the gulf of mexico 
annual operating income more than doubled as we continued to benefit from rate increases and high utilization for our seven vessels and our diving assets 
in  our subsea projects segment had better results than due to a continuation of inspection and repair work necessitated by hurricane ivan and additional inspection and repair work necessitated by hurricanes katrina and rita 
during the year  as a result of high demand  we benefited from improved pricing 
in addition  we spot chartered three vessels and a barge from which we provided services 
we anticipate our operating income for subsea projects to be about the same as  based on our expectations of continued favorable demand for deepwater installation and inspection  repair and maintenance activities and hurricane damage related projects 
for  our inspection revenue increased and margins improved over this was attributable to our successes in providing more value added services  securing new contracts  and controlling our operating expenses 
our operating income grew by over 
for  our inspection revenue and margins increased over we were able to sell more value added services and raise our margin percentages in  after we incurred expenses in to close and relocate offices as part of our effort to increase operating efficiencies subsequent to our purchase of ois international inspection plc in we expect that our inspection segment operating income will decline in  due to a revenue reduction resulting from the completion of a major pipeline project in and reduced emphasis on providing lower margin manpower services 
our mobile offshore production systems results were fairly consistent for the three periods presented as our three major units continued to work under the same contracts 
the decreases in margins were the result of the anticipated decline in the dayrate of the ocean legend  as per the customer renewal option terms in the existing contract 
we anticipate our mobile offshore production systems operating income in will decline from by approximately as a result of a lower dayrate going into effect in mid may for the use of the ocean legend  as per the customer renewal option terms in the existing contract 

table of contents advanced technologies 
the table that follows sets out revenue and profitability for this segment for the years ended december   and year ended december  dollars in thousands revenue gross margin gross margin operating income operating income our advanced technologies margins for decreased from those of  primarily due to the transfer of the performer to our subsea projects segment in april our revenue was higher than from demand for general engineering services 
our advanced technologies revenue  gross margin and operating margin for decreased from  due to lower demand from the navy for waterfront facility work and general engineering services and a reduction of deepwater search and recovery projects 
we also incurred expenses in relocating our maryland office 
we anticipate our advanced technologies operating income will be slightly higher than from higher us navy demand for general engineering services and submarine repair  maintenance and engineering projects 
unallocated expenses 
our unallocated expenses  ie  those not associated with a specific business segment  within gross margin consist of expenses related to our incentive and deferred compensation plans  including restricted stock and bonuses  as well as other general expenses 
a portion of our restricted stock expense varies with the market price of our common stock 
our unallocated expenses within operating income consist of those within gross margin plus general and administrative expenses related to corporate functions 
the table that follows sets out our unallocated expenses for the years ended december   and year ended december  dollars in thousands gross margin expenses of revenue operating expenses of revenue our unallocated gross margin and operating expenses increased in over  primarily due to compensation related to incentive plans as a result of record results and our higher stock price 
our unallocated operating expenses in and included million and million  respectively  related to post retirement benefits for our current chairman and former chief executive officer 
in november  we entered into an agreement with our chairman the chairman who was also then our chief executive officer 
that agreement was amended in pursuant to the amended agreement  the chairman relinquished his position as chief executive officer in may and began his post employment service period on december  the agreement provides for a specific service period ending no later than august   during which the chairman  acting as an independent contractor  has agreed to serve as nonexecutive chairman of our board of directors for so long as our board of directors desires that he shall continue to serve in that capacity 
the agreement provides the chairman with post employment benefits for ten years following his services to us 
the amendment includes a lump sum cash buyout  to be paid in  of the chairman s entitlement to perquisites and administrative assistance during that ten year period expected to run from to 
as a result  we recorded million of associated expense in the fourth quarter of the agreement also provides for medical coverage on an after tax basis to the chairman  his spouse and children during his service with us and thereafter for their lives 
we are recognizing the net present value of the post employment benefits over the expected service period 
if the service period is terminated for 
table of contents any reason other than the chairman s refusal to continue serving  we will recognize all the previously unaccrued benefits in the period in which that termination occurs 
our gross margin and operating expenses increased in over  primarily due to larger bonus payments to employees as a result of our record financial results 
our selling  general and administrative expenses increased in and principally due to the additional expenses associated with the increased activity levels  expenses related to companies and operations we acquired  increased costs related to sarbanes oxley act compliance and documentation  and expenses related to training and implementation of a new enterprise software system that we began activating in our unallocated expenses in included million related to a terminated acquisition effort

year ended december  dollars in thousands interest income interest expense  net of amounts capitalized equity earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates medusa spar llc cable lay and maintenance canadian rov joint venture other income expense  net provision for income taxes interest expense increased in and  primarily because we used debt to partially finance capital expenditures and acquisitions 
interest rates were also slightly higher 
interest expense is net of capitalized interest of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  we started earning equity income from our investment in medusa spar llc  which we acquired in december medusa spar llc owns of a production spar in the gulf of mexico and earns its revenue from tariffs charged on production processed through the facility 
during and  additional wells were connected to the facility  thereby raising and throughput over the level 
in  we expect a decrease of approximately million in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates from our investment in medusa spar llc due to lower production throughput at the spar 
due to the condition of the telecommunications market  the single vessel used in the cable lay and maintenance venture was marketed for oilfield and other uses commencing in in  we purchased the cable lay and maintenance equipment from the venture  and in  we purchased the vessel from the venture 
our purchase of the vessel effectively ended the operations of the venture 
we subsequently sold the vessel for a small gain 
the venture will be liquidated after collection of outstanding amounts receivable and payment of remaining amounts owed to creditors 
other income expense  net  primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses 
our effective tax rate  including foreign  state and local taxes  was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in each of and  we lowered our effective tax rate  as we resolved tax contingencies of million and million  respectively  related to certain foreign tax liabilities we recorded in prior years 
in  our rate was less than the us statutory rate of because we reversed valuation allowances related to net operating loss carryforwards  as we were able to utilize those carryforwards

table of contents contractual obligations at december   we had payments due under contractual obligations as follows dollars in thousands payments due by period total after long term debt operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations reflected on our balance sheet under gaap total the above schedule takes into account the terms of the january amendment of our revolving credit facility  which extended its maturity to january at december   we had outstanding purchase orders totaling million  including approximately million for specialized steel tubes to be used in our manufacturing of steel tube umbilicals 
due to the current shortage of these specialized materials caused by a general worldwide increase in demand for steel  the lead times between placing the order and delivery have become extended 
we have contracts to build umbilicals that will use over of the orders 
we also have other identified opportunities that could utilize these materials 
however  should we decide not to accept delivery of the steel tubes  we would incur cancellation charges of at least of the amount canceled 
effects of inflation and changing prices our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  using historical us dollar accounting  or historical cost 
statements based on historical cost  however  do not adequately reflect the cumulative effect of increasing costs and changes in the purchasing power of the dollar  especially during times of significant and continued inflation 
in order to minimize the negative impact of inflation on our operations  we attempt to cover the increased cost of anticipated changes in labor  material and service costs  either through an estimate of those changes  which we reflect in the original price  or through price escalation clauses in our contracts 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are currently exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions we have entered into in the normal course of business 
these risks relate to interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we do not believe these risks are material 
we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we manage our exposure to interest rate changes through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of our long term debt agreements  interest rates and maturities 
we believe that significant interest rate changes will not have a material near term impact on our future earnings or cash flows 
because we operate in various oil and gas exploration and production regions in the world  we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the us dollar 
the functional currency for several of our international operations is the applicable local currency 
we manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally through arranging compensation in us dollars or freely convertible currency and  to the extent possible  by limiting compensation received in other currencies to amounts necessary to meet obligations denominated in those currencies 
we use the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date to translate assets and liabilities as to which the functional currency is the local currency  resulting in translation adjustments that we reflect as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheets 
we recorded adjustments of million  million and million to our equity accounts for the years ended december   and  respectively 
positive adjustments reflect the net impact of the strengthening of various foreign currencies against the us dollar for locations where the functional currency is not the us dollar 
conversely  negative adjustments reflect the effect of a strengthening dollar 

table of contents we recorded foreign currency transaction gains losses of million  million and million in our consolidated income statements in  and  respectively  related to our foreign operations 
in and  the majority of our foreign currency losses related to our uk operations 
some of our uk subsidiary s revenue is from us dollar denominated contracts 
if the us dollar weakens against the british pound sterling  we will incur currency losses for the period the related accounts receivable are outstanding
