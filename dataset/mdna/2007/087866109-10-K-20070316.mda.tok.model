item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of beverly hills bancorp inc and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this filing 
references in this filing to beverly hills bancorp inc  bhbc  the company  we  our  and us refer to beverly hills bancorp inc and our subsidiaries  unless the context indicates otherwise 
overview beverly hills bancorp inc is a financial holding company that conducts primarily banking and lending operations in southern california and surrounding states through our bank subsidiary  first bank of beverly hills 
our business strategy is focused on the growth and profitability of the bank through originations and purchases of commercial real estate and multifamily mortgage loans and investments in primarily aaa rated and government sponsored enterprise gse mortgage backed securities 
the bank is a california state chartered commercial bank  and its primary regulator is the california department of financial institutions dfi 
as an insured institution  the bank continues to be regulated by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
our net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the higher earnings per share in  despite the slight decline in net income for the year  was due to our repurchase of million shares of outstanding common stock in august the results for include a pre tax gain of million on the sale of the bank s beverly hills branch in november this sale reflected our efforts to reduce administrative overhead and our intention to operate principally as a wholesale bank 
the gain from the sale of the beverly hills branch was offset in substantial part by a million reduction in net interest income 
this decline was due primarily to a decrease in our net interest margin  as the interest rate cost of our interest bearing liabilities increased faster than the yields on our interest earning assets 
the year results also reflect a million decline in other operating income and a million increase in the provision for loan losses 
our stockholders equity declined by million for the year ended december  to million  or book value per diluted share  despite our net income of million 
this decrease was due primarily to the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for a total price of million and cash dividends of million 
these decreases were partially offset by net after tax unrealized gains of million on the portfolio of available for sale securities and a million increase in paid in capital representing stock based compensation expense 
critical accounting policies and estimates the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this form k  are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the estimates used  including  but not limited to  those related to allowances for loan losses  other than temporary impairment in the market values of investment securities  the realizability of deferred tax assets  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements mortgage backed and other investment securities available for sale 
the company s mortgage backed and other investment securities available for sale are reported at their current fair market value 
in determining current fair value when quotes from third parties are not available  we estimate the present value of the anticipated cash flows of the securities based on certain assumptions  including the amount and timing of future repayments  the discount rate to be used  and default rates and expected losses on the loans underlying the securities 
if the change in market value is considered temporary  the unrealized holding gains and losses are reported net of tax  when applicable  as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
in the event of a decline in market value  management must evaluate whether the decline is temporary in nature or other than temporary 
in making this evaluation  management must consider certain factors  including a whether the company has the ability and intent to hold the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient for the recovery of the fair value up to or beyond the cost of the investment  and b whether evidence indicating that the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary 
declines that are considered other than temporary are reflected as market valuation losses and impairments in the consolidated statements of operations and not as a direct reduction to stockholders equity 
the company s portfolio of mortgage backed and other investment securities available for sale represented more than of consolidated total assets as of december  consequently  fluctuations in the securities values can have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for loan losses 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level believed adequate by management to absorb estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolios 
the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses charged against operations  recoveries of previously charged off loans  and allocations of discounts on purchased loans  and is decreased by loan charge offs 
loans are charged off when they are deemed to be uncollectible 
the company uses its internal asset review system to evaluate its loan portfolio and to classify loans as pass  special mention  substandard  substandard well secured  doubtful or loss 
these terms correspond to varying degrees of risk that the loans will not be collected in part or in full 
the frequency at which a specific loan is subjected to internal asset review depends on the type and size of the loan and the presence or absence of other risk factors  such as delinquency and changes in collateral values 
the allowance for loan losses consists of general valuation allowances gvas  which are derived primarily from the company s loss migration factors 
specific valuation allowances svas are established for impaired loans  and are equal to the excess of the unpaid principal balance over the fair value of the collateral for all impaired loans 
for all loans except discounted loans  the svas are charged off at the end of the month in which they are established 
gvas are based on loss migration factors that are updated each quarter 
gvas also include a qualitative adjustment  which represents management s evaluation after consideration of certain credit risk characteristics 
these risk characteristics include  but are not limited to  the following the institution s historical and recent loss experience in its portfolios  the volume  severity and trend of non performing assets  the extent to which refinances or loan modifications are made to maintain loans in a current status  known deterioration in credit concentrations or certain classes of loans  loan to value ratios of real estate secured loans  risks associated with specific types of collateral  the quality and effectiveness of the lending policy  loan purchase policy  internal asset review policy  charge off  collection and recovery policies  current and anticipated conditions in the general and local economies which might affect the collectability of the institution s asset  anticipated changes in the composition or volume of the loan portfolio  and reasonableness standards in accordance with regulatory agency policies 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these risk characteristics is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio components 
apart from a qualitative adjustment  management currently maintains a risk modeling reserve in the range of to of the total estimated allowance for loan losses  due to the inherent risk associated with the imprecision in estimating the allowance 
to assess the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses  the portfolio is segmented into three components impaired loans  homogeneous loans  and non homogeneous loans 
in determining which loans are impaired  the company applies statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the company s impaired loans include all loan types classified as substandard  doubtful or loss including loans which may have been upgraded but which are troubled debt restructurings 
svas are measured on a loan by loan basis utilizing either the discounted cash flow or fair market value approaches  as defined under sfas no 
homogeneous loans have been defined as loans secured by one to four single family residences  mobile home loans and consumer loans  and are analyzed for impairment collectively by their respective loan group 
gva loss estimates are measured utilizing the company s loss migration factors 
non homogeneous loans include the following loan types multifamily  commercial real estate  bridge loans  construction loans  land loans and commercial unsecured 
the non homogeneous loans are analyzed individually for impairment 
gva loss estimates are measured utilizing the company s loss migration factors 
a loss horizon of seven years has been developed with the objective of achieving loss data to capture a full business cycle 
when the company increases the allowance for loan losses related to loans  it records a corresponding increase to the provision for loan losses in the statement of operations 
the dfi and fdic  as part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for losses and the carrying values of its assets 
there can be no assurance that the dfi or fdic will not require additional reserves following future examinations 
income taxes 
at december  we had a total gross deferred tax asset of million 
this asset represents the tax effect of future deductible or taxable amounts and is attributable to net operating loss carryforwards and also to temporary differences between amounts that have been recognized in the financial statements and amounts that have been recognized in the company s income tax returns 
in accounting for the deferred tax assets  we apply sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires  among other things  that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as of december   we evaluated the positive and negative evidence regarding the future realization of the deferred tax assets 
pursuant to this evaluation  we concluded that the available objective positive evidence regarding our ability to generate future federal taxable income substantially outweighed the available objective negative evidence regarding future federal taxable income 
we also concluded that the objective negative evidence regarding the ability to generate certain future state taxable income outweighed the available objective positive evidence regarding certain future state taxable income  due primarily to the curtailment of our operations in the state of oregon following the sale of wcc 
as a result  we believe it is more likely than not that a substantial amount of our deferred tax asset will be realized in future years 
consequently  we believe that as of december   that the only valuation allowance required is approximately million related to net operating loss carryforwards in oregon and certain other states 
as portions of the deferred tax asset are realized and the valuation allowance is reduced  the related benefits  to the extent they related to our post reorganizational period  are recorded as a deferred tax benefit in our consolidated statements of operations 
as benefits relating to our pre reorganizational period are realized  they are recorded as a direct increase to stockholders equity 
the net deferred tax asset of million is reported as an asset in our consolidated statement of financial condition as of december  however  there can be no assurance that the amount  if any  that we ultimately realize will not differ materially from our assessment 
results of operations compared to interest income a significant portion of our consolidated earnings arises from net interest income  which is the difference between interest income received and interest expense paid 
net interest income is affected by the relative amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the degree of mismatch in the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  information regarding the total amount of our income from interest earning assets and the resulting average yields  the interest expense associated with interest bearing liabilities  expressed in dollars and rates  and the net interest spread and net interest margin 
the interest income and expense amounts in the table below are consolidated  but reflect primarily the results of our banking operations 
information is based on monthly balances during the indicated periods

net interest spread represents the weighted average yield on interest earning assets minus the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income divided by total average interest earning assets 
the following table describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and expense during the periods indicated 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to i changes in volume change in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes in rate change in rate multiplied by prior volume and iii total change in rate and volume 
changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate

as a result  our weighted average cost of interest bearing liabilities increased by basis points to for the year ended december   compared with for the year ended december  in contrast  our yield on interest earning assets increased by only basis points  to for compared with for we anticipate that the net interest margin may narrow further in future periods if the treasury yield remains relatively flat 
in addition  the sale of the beverly hills branch may cause a reduction in the net interest margin  due to our reduced retail presence and our increasing reliance on higher costing brokered deposits 
interest income on mortgage backed securities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in reflects both an increase in yields and a higher average earning asset balance 
the higher yields  which were precipitated by rising market interest rates  extended the expected lives of the securities and reduced the amortization of premiums 
as a result  our yield on mortgage backed securities increased by basis points  from for to for the increase in the average investment balance from to reflects our purchase of million in mortgage backed securities in the second quarter of  in addition to an increase in mortgage backed securities throughout interest income on loans was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to a basis point increase in the weighted average yield on our loans  from for to for  reflecting the continuing increase in market interest rates 
our adjustable rate loans including loans with an initial fixed rate for or years which subsequently convert to adjustable rate have comprised between of our total loans for the past year  and therefore our portfolio is highly sensitive to interest rate fluctuations 
the higher yield in was also a result of our expansion into construction loans  which had a weighted average yield of for the year 
to a lesser extent  the increase in loan interest income was due to a million increase in the average balance of loans from to this increase in average loan volume reflects the moderate growth in our loan portfolio throughout the effects of which are realized in future periods and loan portfolio acquisitions in the second and fourth quarters of interest expense on deposits was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  this increase was due to both a basis point increase in the average cost of our interest bearing deposits from for to for and a significant increase in the average balance of deposits during the year 
the higher average cost of funds in was largely due to the continuing increase in market interest rates  which raised the cost of deposits as maturing certificates of deposit cds were replaced with higher costing cds 
in addition  the proportion of cds to total deposits increased to an average of for  compared with an average of for we have increasingly utilized deposits as our primary funding source in and raised a significant volume of wholesale cds  resulting in a million increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits over interest expense on repurchase agreements and fhlb advances totaled million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  this increase was due to the higher market interest rates in as a result  the cost of our repurchase agreements increased by basis points  from in to in  and the cost of our fhlb advances increased by basis points  from to over the same periods 
the effects of the higher rates more than offset a decline in the average balance of borrowings 
the average volume or repurchase agreements and fhlb advances declined by million and million  respectively  from to  as we increasingly utilized cds as our primary funding source in interest expense on our junior subordinated notes payable was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  this increase reflects both higher average borrowing balances and higher rates in in may we issued million in junior subordinated notes payable to fund our anticipated stock repurchase  and in december we issued an additional million 
this new debt increased the average liability balance for by million over the average balance for these new notes and our earlier notes  issued in july  bear interest at a premium over libor  and therefore generate higher interest expense in periods of rising rates 
consequently  the average cost of our junior subordinated notes payable increased by basis points from to provision for loan losses provisions for losses on loans are charged to operations to maintain an allowance for losses on the loan portfolio at a level that we believe is adequate based on an evaluation of the inherent risks in the portfolio 
our evaluation is based on an analysis of the loan portfolio  historical loss experience  credit concentrations  current economic conditions and trends  the effects of interest rate changes on collateral values  and other relevant factors 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these factors is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio components 
we currently intend to maintain an unallocated allowance in the range of to of the total estimated allowance for loan losses  due to the inherent risk associated with the imprecision in estimating the allowance 
we recorded a provision for loan losses of  for the year ended december   compared with net recaptures of loan loss reserves of  for the year ended december  the increase in the provision for was due primarily to a change in the composition of our loan portfolio 
in  we expanded our product line to include construction loans  and also saw a substantial increase in our loans secured by land 
because these categories of loans carry more risk than commercial and multifamily real estate loans  we increased our reserves accordingly to provide for possible estimated losses 
the credit quality of our assets is affected by many factors beyond our control  including local and national economic conditions  and the possible existence of facts which are not known to us which adversely affect the likelihood of repayment of various loans in our loan portfolio and realization of the collateral upon a default 
accordingly  we can give no assurance that we will not sustain loan losses materially in excess of the allowance for loan losses 
other income our other income was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in was due to the million pre tax gain on the sale of our beverly hills branch in the fourth quarter 
in addition  other income for includes the initial payment of  received from a former officer for reimbursement of legal fees the company paid on his behalf in prior years 
see item and note to the consolidated financial statements 
payments received pursuant to our settlement agreement with the former officer will be recorded as other income when received 
partially offsetting these increases in other income was a million decline in our real estate income  reflecting a provision for loss on a multifamily property which was acquired through foreclosure 
in addition  our other income for included a one time gain of  resulting from our payoff of a participation liability to a co investor  which previously shared in the returns generated by certain loan portfolios 
other expenses compensation and employee benefits expense totaled million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to a  increase in bonus expense in these higher bonuses include incentive bonuses paid to our chief executive officer pursuant to our stock repurchase and sale of the beverly hills branch and a signing bonus paid to our new executive vice president and chief lending officer 
our legal expenses declined by  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  this decrease was due to the reversal of  in expenses previously accrued on behalf of a former officer after we received a favorable ruling from an arbitrator in may we continue to incur litigation related costs in connection with our disputes with our former loan servicing subsidiary  wilshire credit corporation  and its parent company  merrill lynch 
this litigation is expected to be resolved in other professional fees increased by  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  this increase was largely due to  in consulting fees relating to our repurchase of common stock in august in addition  on an ongoing basis we incur consulting fees in connection with our information systems  which we began outsourcing in the fourth quarter of regulatory assessments were  for the year ended december   compared with  for the year ended december  the decrease in was due to the bank s conversion to a state charter in september because the dfi assesses its annual fee effective july  the bank did not incur such fees in until the third quarter 
our regulatory assessments in included fees paid to the bank s former regulator  the office of thrift supervision  for the first three quarters of the year 
we no longer incur amortization expense related to our core deposit intangible because this asset had been amortized in full as of june  we recorded amortization expense of  on this asset through the first six months of our directors expenses declined by  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  these decreases were due primarily to the reduction in the size of our board of directors from ten members to seven in august in addition  the chairman of our board of directors was hired as our chief executive officer in august  and as a result did not receive any director fees in the company anticipates that the sale of the beverly hills branch in november will result in annual savings of approximately million in compensation  employee benefits and lease expenses in future years 
results of operations compared to our net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the net interest spread increased by basis points  from for to for  and the net interest margin increased from to for the same periods 
the increase in net interest income was due primarily to a higher loan volume in  reflecting the bank s significant loan originations and purchases throughout our average balance of interest earning assets for the year ended december  was more than billion  an increase of million over the average for the year ended december  in addition  interest income for included million in loan prepayment fees  compared with million of such fees in we previously included loan prepayment fees in other income  but reclassified them to interest income in due to the bank s conversion to a state bank charter 
the prior year results have been adjusted to conform to the current year classification 
these increases in interest income more than offset a substantial increase in our interest expense  which resulted from both a higher average balance of interest bearing liabilities and an increase in cost of funds 
the basis point increase in net interest margin from to was the result of the million increase in loan prepayment fees  partially offset by accelerated premium amortization  in excluding the effects of these loan prepayments  we experienced a compression in our net interest margin in due to the continuing rise in market interest rates and the flattening of the yield curve 
our overall cost of funds increased by basis points  from in to in  as maturing deposits and borrowings were replaced with higher costing funds 
interest income on mortgage backed securities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in reflects a million increase in the average balance of mortgage backed securities  primarily as a result of the our purchases of million of mortgage backed securities in the increase also was due to an increase in yield of basis points  from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the higher average yield in resulted from the increase in market interest rates  which extended the expected lives of the securities and reduced the amortization of premiums 
interest income on loans was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in was due primarily to a million increase in the average balance of loans  reflecting the bank s significant loan originations and purchases throughout the bank s loan fundings slowed during  primarily due to the increase in interest rates  which reduced the number of refinancings  and also as a result of increasing competitiveness in loan pricing 
consequently  the bank focused in on increasing its loan acquisition activity  and purchased an aggregate of million unpaid principal balance of multifamily and commercial loans during the year 
these purchases included one multifamily loan portfolio consisting of loans with a total unpaid principal balance of million  and another portfolio of four loans totaling million 
at december   the bank s pipeline of loans in process totaled million 
our increase in loan interest income also reflects a basis point increase in yield  from for to for this increase was due to primarily to the rise in interest rates during the year but also reflects the increase in prepayment fees  net of accelerated premium amortization  in over interest expense on deposits  consisting primarily of certificates of deposit  was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase was due to higher market interest rates in this increase in rates raised the cost of interest bearing deposits by basis points  from for to for interest expense on repurchase agreements and fhlb advances totaled million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  these increases were due primarily to a significant increase in the average balance of outstanding borrowings 
in the latter half of we began to utilize our debt facilities in lieu of certificates of deposit to finance our asset growth 
the increase in interest on borrowings also reflects the recent increases in market interest rates  which raised the average cost of repurchase agreements by basis points from to similarly  the cost of fhlb advances increased by basis points  from an average of for to for provision for loan losses in  we recorded  in net recaptures of loan loss provisions previously taken  compared with a loan loss provision of  for the year ended december  on our discounted loans  we recorded a net loan loss provision of  for the year ended december   compared with net recaptures of  for the year ended december  gain on sale of securities we realized a net gain of  on sales of million in mortgage backed securities for the year ended december  there was no such sales activity during net gains on sales of securities are generated primarily in declining interest rate environments 
accordingly  gains or losses from sales of securities may fluctuate significantly from period to period  and the results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be attained in future periods 
other expenses compensation and employee benefits expense totaled million for the years ended december  and our base employee compensation  primarily salaries and wages  increased by million from to  due to an increase in our lending staff and the opening of the bank s new calabasas branch 
this increase was offset by a million decline in incentive compensation  as a result of a decline in loan fundings in as compared with our legal expenses included in professional fees in the statement of operations increased by million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to expenses related to various ongoing issues with respect to a former officer see item legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements 
other professional fees  particularly audit and consulting expenses  were higher in primarily as a result of expenses related to the implementation of sarbanes oxley section occupancy expense increased slightly from to as a result of the renewal of the lease at our calabasas offices  effective in august the decline in fdic insurance premiums in reflects an overall decline in our deposits from mid  when we began to utilize borrowings as our primary funding source  to the third quarter of our amortization expense represents the amortization recorded on our core deposit intangible asset  which we acquired in connection with our purchase of the beverly hills branch in june as of june   the core deposit intangible asset had been amortized in full and no longer had a book value 
our directors expense declined from to  primarily due to the reduction in the size of our board of directors from ten members to seven in august provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes was million for  compared with income taxes on continuing operations of million for the unusually low tax expense for was due to the elimination of nearly all of the valuation allowance against the company s deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of a portion of the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets primarily net operating losses that were generated in the company s post reorganizational period  and the related benefit was recorded as a deferred tax benefit in our statement of operations 
the majority of the deferred tax assets that were realized were generated in our pre reorganizational period  and the related tax benefits were realized by recording a direct increase to stockholders equity 
our tax provision primarily reflects the statutory income tax rates 
however  approximately million of this expense is not expected to be currently payable in cash due to the utilization of our net operating loss carryforward 
changes in financial condition general at december   our total assets were billion  an increase of million  or  from total assets at december  this increase was due primarily to acquisitions of mortgage backed securities and new loan originations and purchases  which were funded primarily by new certificates of deposit 
the following discussion summarizes the significant changes in our financial condition for the year ended december  mortgage backed and other securities available for sale our portfolio of mortgage backed securities available for sale increased by million during the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to purchases of securities of million  partially offset by principal repayments of million 
in  we substantially increased our investment activity to maintain our overall asset growth during periods of slowing demand for loans 
our purchases included million in gse mortgage backed securities with a weighted average yield of and million in aaa rated mortgage backed securities with a weighted average yield of 
in the third and fourth quarters of  our mortgage backed securities recovered approximately million of their previously recorded unrealized holding losses 
this increase in market value was a result of the decline in longer term treasury yields in the latter half of the year 
while the portfolio s aggregate market value is still less than its amortized cost  its results for the year reflect net holding gains of million 
the balance of our other investment securities available for sale consisting of trust preferred securities and mutual funds declined by million during the year ended december   primarily as a result of repayments 
loans our portfolio of loans  net of discounts and allowances  increased by million for the year ended december  to a total of billion at year end 
this increase was due to loan originations and purchases totaling million  partially offset by repayments of million and a loan loss provision of million 
our loan origination activity continued to be impeded by higher interest rates  which have reduced the number of refinancings  and also by increased competitiveness in loan pricing 
however  in we expanded our product line to include construction loans  and originated and purchased a total of million in loans for the construction of commercial and multifamily residential properties during the year 
at december   we had outstanding commitments to fund million in new construction  commercial and multifamily loans 
our asset quality remains strong  as the unpaid principal balance of nonperforming loans represented approximately of our total loans as of december  real estate owned real estate owned increased by  for the year ended december  this increase was due to acquisitions of million in new properties through foreclosure  including one multifamily property of million 
we subsequently recorded write downs of million on this property and are actively marketing it for sale 
deposits deposits increased by million during the year ended december   despite the elimination of million in deposits as part of the sale of the beverly hills branch 
this increase was due to a significant increase in wholesale cds  which we used as our primary funding source 
the weighted average interest cost of our deposits was at december   compared with at december  the increase in cost was due to both the increase in market interest rates over the prior year and the issuance of higher costing wholesale cds during the year 
at december   our cds comprised of our total deposits  compared with at december  short term borrowings at december   we had million outstanding under a revolving line of credit agreement with another financial institution which we obtained in november this borrowing bears interest at the month libor rate  plus at december   adjusting quarterly 
the proceeds from this debt facility will be used for working capital purposes 
the line of credit is due and payable in full in november repurchase agreements repurchase agreements decreased by million for the year ended december   due to million in maturities with a weighted average cost of  partially offset by a renewal of million bearing interest at 
our outstanding repurchase agreements had a weighted average cost of at december   compared with at december  we did not enter into any additional repurchase agreements during  as our funding requirements were met with new wholesale cds 
fhlb advances fhlb advances decreased by million during the year ended december  this decrease reflects million in maturities  partially offset by million in new advances 
the significant activity in fhlb advances in was largely due to the sale of our beverly hills branch 
at the close of the sale in november  we borrowed million in short term fhlb advances to replace the deposits transferred in the sale 
as these new advances matured  we replaced the funds with brokered cds in order to maintain sufficient unused borrowing capacity 
the fhlb has authorized a borrowing limit for total fhlb advances of of the bank s total assets as of the previous quarter end 
junior subordinated notes payable to trusts our total junior subordinated notes payable to trusts increased from million at december  to million at december  this increase was due to two issuances of these borrowings during the year 
in may we issued million in junior subordinated notes payable bearing interest at over the month libor rate to finance our anticipated stock repurchase  and in december we issued an additional million  bearing interest at over the month libor 
the trusts purchased these notes using the proceeds from private placements of trust preferred securities to unaffiliated third parties and from the issuance of common securities to the company 
stockholders equity our stockholders equity declined by million for the year ended december  to million  or book value per diluted share  despite our net income of million 
this decrease was due primarily to the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for a total price of million and cash dividends of million 
these decreases were partially offset by net after tax unrealized gains of million on the portfolio of available for sale securities and a million increase in paid in capital representing stock based compensation expense 
off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business 
these financial instruments include debt obligations and commitments to extend credit and involve  to varying degrees  elements of risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
at december   we had outstanding commitments to extend credit of million 
these commitments expose us to credit risk in excess of amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
we receive collateral to support loans and commitments to extend credit for which collateral is deemed necessary 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the measurement of an entity s ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  originate loans  fund investments  purchase pools of loans  and make payments for general business purposes 
our sources of liquidity include wholesale and retail deposits  fhlb advances up to of the bank s total assets as of the previous quarter end  repurchase agreements  repayments of loans and mortgage backed securities  and net interest income 
we manage our liquidity on a daily basis  and our board of directors periodically reviews our liquidity 
this process is intended to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet our operating needs 
based on our current and expected asset size  capital levels  and organizational infrastructure  we believe there will be sufficient available liquidity to meet our operating needs 
at december   we had million of cds 
scheduled maturities of cds during the months ending december  and thereafter amounted to million and million  respectively 
wholesale deposits generally are more responsive to changes in interest rates than core deposits  and thus are more likely to be withdrawn by the investor upon maturity as changes in interest rates and other factors are perceived by investors to make other investments more attractive

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk managing risk is an essential part of successfully operating a financial services company 
the most prominent risk exposures are credit quality  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity 
credit quality risk is the risk of not collecting interest and or the principal balance of a loan or investment when it is due 
interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income as the result of changes in interest rates 
rate movements can affect the repricing of assets and liabilities differently  as well as their market values  and also can affect the ability of the borrower to repay 
liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to depositors  investors and borrowers 
asset and liability management it is our objective to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  management s strategy is to limit our exposure to earnings volatility and variations in the value of assets and liabilities as interest rates change over time 
our asset and liability management strategy is formulated and monitored by the asset and liability committees of the company and of the board of directors collectively  alco which reviews  among other things  the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses including those attributable to hedging transactions  purchase activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
alco establishes rate sensitivity tolerances within regulatory guidelines which are approved by our board of directors  and coordinates with our board with respect to overall asset and liability composition 
alco is authorized to utilize off balance sheet financial techniques to assist in the management of interest rate risk 
these techniques include interest rate swap agreements  pursuant to which the parties exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest payments on a specified principal amount referred to as the notional amount for a specified period without the exchange of the underlying principal amount 
we continually monitor the interest rate sensitivity of our portfolios of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in conjunction with the current interest rate environment 
when new pools of loans or securities are acquired  we will assess the incremental change in our sensitivity to interest rates  and determine accordingly whether or not to hedge 
in addition  alco also regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on the interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value npv  which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
alco further evaluates such impacts against the maximum tolerable change in interest income that is authorized by our board of directors 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in the company s net portfolio value at december   should interest rates increase or decrease by to basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value net portfolio value npv as of assets amount change change npv ratio change dollars in thousands change in rates bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp bp   bp bp  bp bp   bp in determining net portfolio value  we make various assumptions  including  but not limited to  prepayment speeds on the company s assets and the discount rates to be used 
we review our assumptions regularly and adjust them when it is deemed appropriate based on current and future expected market conditions 
we believe that the assumptions including prepayment assumptions we use to evaluate the vulnerability of our operations to changes in interest rates approximate actual experience and consider them reasonable 
however  the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities and the estimated effects of changes in interest rates on npv could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual experience differs from the historical experience on which they are based 
another tool used to identify and manage our interest rate risk profile is the static gap analysis 
interest sensitivity gap analysis measures the difference between the assets and liabilities repricing or maturing within specific time periods 
the following table summarizes the scheduled maturities or repricing of the bank s assets and liabilities based on their contractual terms as of december  within twelve months more than one year to three years more than three years to five years over five years total dollars in thousands assets cash and due from banks mortgage backed and other investment securities single family residential loans multifamily residential loans commercial real estate loans construction loans consumer and other loans other assets total assets liabilities demand deposits now and money market accounts savings accounts certificates of deposit short term borrowings repurchase agreements fhlb advances junior subordinated notes payable to trusts other liabilities total liabilities deficiency excess of assets over liabilities cumulative deficiency excess cumulative deficiency excess as a percent of total assets includes unamortized premium on loans and allowance for loan losses
