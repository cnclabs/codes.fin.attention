item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
all intercompany transactions have been eliminated 
overview we are a leading provider of contract land drilling services in the united states with a fleet  at february   of rigs  all of which were marketed 
our customers include independent producers and major oil and natural gas companies 
we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries in the ark la tex  gulf coast  mississippi alabama  south texas  mid continent and rocky mountain drilling markets 
our drilling contracts generally provide compensation on a daywork  turnkey or footage basis see item business contracts 
our business is cyclical and our financial results depend upon several factors 
these factors include the overall demand for land drilling services  the dayrates we receive for our services  the level of demand for turnkey and footage services and our success drilling turnkey and footage wells 
new rig purchases and reactivations during  we entered into agreements to purchase six new  horsepower rigs for a total of million 
as of february   three of these rigs are working 
one of the remaining three new rigs is scheduled for delivery later in the first quarter of  one in the second quarter  and the last rig is expected by the end of the third quarter 
after deployment of these rigs our rig fleet will total rigs 
these new rigs are designed to enhance safety  increase the efficiency of rig moves  and maximize performance for our customers 
our ongoing strategy is to add to capacity only with the support of term contracts 
all six of the new rigs as well as the refurbishments completed over the last several years were supported by long term contracts  whereby the company fully expects to recover the cost of the capital expended during the original contract term 
rig activity historically  strong commodity prices have benefited the land drilling industry 
the land rig count at february  per the baker hughes rotary rig count  is over  rigs 
our average rigs working have also escalated because of the demand for our services  including the addition of the new rigs 
however  there is currently some excess capacity in the land drilling market with the addition of new rigs during the last year and additional new and refurbished rigs are expected to enter the market 
for the week ended february   we had an average of rigs working 
the table below shows the average number of land rigs working in the united states according to the baker hughes rotary rig count and the average number of our rigs working 
domestic land rig full full to count q q q q year q q q q year baker hughes grey wolf term contracts as of february  we had  rig days contracted for under term contracts  as compared with  rig days under term contract at september   and  rig days under term contract at february  our rig days under contract at february  is approximately equivalent to an average of rigs working under term contracts for and an average of rigs working for at february  we had rigs working under term contracts  representing of our total rig fleet 
these term contracts are expected to provide revenue of approximately million in and million in over the last several months  the rate at which we have been able to sign new term contracts has slowed significantly 
our term contracts typically range in length from one to three years and include a per rig day cancellation fee approximately equal to the dayrate under the contract less estimated operating expenses for the unexpired term 
table of contents of the contract 
in addition  we are able to pass the cost of any labor increases on to our customers through our dayrates on all daywork contracts  including term contracts 
drilling contract rates improvements in the level of land drilling in the united states over the last three years have positively impacted the dayrates we are receiving for our rigs 
we experienced an average increase in dayrates of  per day from to  which represented a improvement 
this was the primary factor in our increase in earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda per rig day from  in to  in a rig day is defined as a twenty four hour period in which a rig is under contract and should be earning revenue 
a january  report published by rigdata showed that newly built or refurbished rigs are expected to enter the domestic land drilling market in as a result of the newly built and refurbished rigs that have come to market in recent months  there is currently some excess capacity of land drilling rigs  and this may increase as additional rigs enter the market 
over the last several months  we and some of our competitors have experienced and may continue to experience some rigs becoming idle which could affect future utilization of our rigs 
late in the fourth quarter of  we began to see a weakening in spot market dayrates in connection with the excess supply of land drilling rigs 
in addition  since that time we have experienced between a to average decline in the dayrates we use in bidding on drilling contracts 
however  we have a significant number of existing term contracts at fixed dayrates that have buffered our exposure to the recent erosion in spot market dayrates and the effects of extra capacity 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  we had several term contracts that renewed at higher dayrates 
the dayrates on these rollovers increased as dayrates were significantly lower at the time we entered into the contract  which was up to two years prior 
as a result of these rollovers and our term contract exposure  the average dayrates we expect to realize during the first quarter of are not expected to be negatively impacted 
we may experience some decline in our overall dayrates beginning in the second quarter of as some of our spot and term contracts come up for renewal at the lower rates 
however  if demand for land drilling rigs were to trend upward before the end of the second quarter  we may see no effect of the recent reductions in spot market dayrates 
in addition to our fleet of drilling rigs  we owned top drives at february   for which our rates are  per rig day at that date 
rates for our top drives are in addition to the above stated rates for our rigs 
turnkey and footage contract activity turnkey and footage work is an important part of our business and operating strategy and produced record results during our engineering and operating expertise allow us to provide this service to our customers and has historically provided higher revenues and ebitda per rig day worked than under daywork contracts 
however  we are typically required to bear additional operating costs such as drill bits and risk such as loss of hole that would otherwise be assumed by the customer under daywork contracts 
in  our turnkey and footage ebitda per rig day was  compared to a daywork ebitda per rig day of  and our turnkey and footage revenue was  per rig day compared to  per rig day for daywork 
in  our turnkey and footage ebitda per rig day was  compared to a daywork ebitda per rig day of  and our turnkey and footage revenue was  per rig day compared to  per rig day for daywork 
for the year ended december   turnkey and footage work represented of total rig days worked compared to of total rig days worked in although turnkey ebitda per rig day for the fourth quarter of was lower compared to the previous quarter  our turnkey business added million  or  of total company ebitda for and outpaced daywork ebitda per rig day by for the year 
ebitda generated on turnkey and footage contracts can vary widely based upon a number of factors  including the location of the contracted work  the depth and level of complexity of the wells drilled and the ultimate success of drilling the well 
the demand for drilling services under turnkey and footage contracts has historically been lower during periods of overall higher rig demand 
overall rig demand has been higher as evidenced by the increase in rig count  and the demand for turnkey services has remained relatively constant in the past few years 
however  we do expect a slight decline in the number of rigs working under turnkey contracts in the first quarter of results and first quarter outlook we set record levels of revenue  net income  and ebitda in for the second straight year 
year over year our net income rose by and revenues increased by 
ebitda for totaled million  up 
table of contents from we also improved our year over year safety recordable incident rate by at the same time the man hours worked increased by almost 
during the first quarter of  we expect to average to rigs working with six to eight of these rigs performing turnkey services 
in addition  average daywork revenue per rig day is expected to increase by to with little or no change in average daywork operating expenses per day as our new rigs enter the market and the effect of the higher term contract dayrates from the fourth quarter term contract renewals is realized 
depreciation expense of approximately million  interest expense of approximately million and an effective tax rate of approximately are expected for the first quarter of based upon the remaining payments for the new rig purchases and rig activity  capital expenditures for the full year are projected to be million to million 
these projections are forward looking statements and while we believe our estimates are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations or the assumptions that underlie such assumptions will prove to be correct 
additionally  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the current level of activity or the financial results we have historically derived from turnkey and footage contracts 
see item business forward looking statements for important factors that could cause actual results to be different materially from our expectations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements require our management to make subjective estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
however  these estimates  judgments and assumptions concern matters that are inherently uncertain 
accordingly  actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the accounting policies that we believe are critical are property and equipment  impairment of long lived assets  goodwill  revenue recognition  insurance accruals  and income taxes 
property and equipment 
property and equipment  including betterments and improvements are stated at cost with depreciation calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we make estimates with respect to the useful lives that we believe are reasonable 
however  the cyclical nature of our business or the introduction of new technology in the industry  could cause us to change our estimates  thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation 
when any asset is tested for recoverability  we also review the remaining useful life of the asset 
any changes to the estimated useful life resulting from that review are made prospectively 
we expense our maintenance and repair costs as incurred 
we estimate the useful lives of our assets are between three and years 
impairment of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of our long lived assets under statement of financial accounting standards board sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such indicators include changes in our business plans  a change in the physical condition of a long lived asset or the extent or manner in which it is being used  or a severe or sustained downturn in the oil and natural gas industry 
if we determine that a triggering event  such as those described previously  has occurred we perform a review of our rig and rig equipment 
our review is performed by comparing the carrying value of each rig plus the estimated cost to refurbish or reactivate to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows for that rig 
if the carrying value plus estimated refurbishment and reactivation cost of any rig is more than the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the rig  a write down of the rig to estimated fair market value must be made 
the estimated fair market value is the amount at which an asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
quoted market prices in active markets are the best estimate of fair market value  however  quoted market prices are generally not available 
as a result  fair value must be determined based upon other valuation techniques 
this could include appraisals or present value calculations 
the calculation of undiscounted future net cash flows and fair market value is based on our estimates and projections 
the demand for land drilling services is cyclical and has historically resulted in fluctuations in rig utilization 
we believe the contract drilling industry will continue to be cyclical and rig utilization will fluctuate 
the likelihood of an asset impairment increases during extended periods of rig inactivity 
each year we evaluate our rigs available for refurbishment and determine our intentions for their future use 
at december   we had no rigs available for refurbishment as all rigs were working 
this evaluation takes into consideration  among other 
table of contents things  the physical condition and marketability of the rig  and projected reactivation or refurbishment cost 
to the extent that our estimates of refurbishment and reactivation cost  undiscounted future net cash flows or fair market value change or there is a deterioration in the physical condition of the rigs available for refurbishment  we could be required under sfas no 
to record an impairment charge 
in and  no impairment of our long lived assets was recorded 
goodwill 
during the second quarter of  we completed the acquisition of new patriot drilling corp 
patriot  which was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
in conjunction with the purchase price allocation of the patriot acquisition we recorded goodwill of million 
goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of assets of the business acquired 
none of the goodwill resulting from this acquisition is deductible for tax purposes 
we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
no impairment of our goodwill was recorded during and revenue recognition 
revenues are earned under daywork  turnkey and footage contracts 
revenue from daywork and footage contracts is recognized when it is realized or realizable and earned 
on daywork contracts  revenue is recognized based on the number of days completed at fixed rates stipulated by the contract 
on footage contracts  revenue is recognized based on the number of feet that have been drilled at fixed rates stipulated by the contract 
revenue from turnkey drilling contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method based upon costs incurred to date compared to our estimate of the total contract costs 
under percentage of completion  we make estimates of the total contract costs to be incurred  and to the extent these estimates change  the amount of revenue recognized could be affected 
the significance of the accrued turnkey revenue varies from period to period depending on the overall level of demand for our services and the portion of that demand that is for turnkey services 
at december   there were three turnkey wells in progress versus nine wells at december   with accrued revenue of million and million  respectively at such dates 
anticipated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts are recorded at the time our estimated costs exceed the contract revenue 
insurance accruals 
we maintain insurance coverage related to workers compensation and general liability claims up to million per occurrence with an aggregate of million for general liability claims 
these policies include deductibles of  per occurrence for workers compensation coverage and  per occurrence for general liability coverage 
if losses should exceed the workers compensation and general liability policy amounts  we have excess liability coverage up to a maximum of million 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  accrued for losses incurred within the deductible amounts for workers compensation and general liability claims and for uninsured claims 
the amount accrued for the provision for losses incurred varies depending on the number and nature of the claims outstanding at the balance sheet dates 
in addition  the accrual includes management s estimate of the future cost to settle each claim such as future changes in the severity of the claim and increases in medical costs 
we use third parties to assist us in developing our estimate of the ultimate costs to settle each claim  which is based upon historical experience associated with the type of each claim and specific information related to each claim 
the specific circumstances of each claim may change over time prior to settlement and as a result  our estimates made as of the balance sheet dates may change 
income taxes 
we are subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which we operate 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required because a income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of our annual accounting period  b tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle  and c future events often impact the timing of when we recognize income tax expenses and benefits 
we have deferred tax assets mostly relating to workers compensation liabilities and our long term incentive plans 
we routinely evaluate all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance as of december  and  respectively 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax 
table of contents position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin and we do not believe it will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
financial condition and liquidity the following table summarizes our financial position as of december  and december  december  december  dollars in thousands amount amount working capital property and equipment  net goodwill other noncurrent assets  net total long term debt other long term liabilities shareholders equity total significant changes in financial condition the significant changes in our financial position from december  to december  are an increase in working capital of million  an increase in net property and equipment of million  and an increase in shareholders equity of million 
the increase in working capital is primarily the result of higher balances in cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents is due to more rigs working at higher dayrates as well as the proceeds from the sale of five of our rigs previously held for refurbishment during the first quarter of also contributing to the increase were insurance proceeds received during the second quarter of in connection with the casualty loss of one of our rigs and top drives 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents is partially offset by repurchases we made of our common stock during the increase in accounts receivable is due to more rigs working and increased dayrates while accounts payable is higher because of higher rig activity and increased prices for goods and services 
the increase in working capital was also offset by higher current taxes payable because of increased net income and larger liabilities for our employee retention programs 
the increase in net property and equipment is due to capital expenditures during  partially offset by the write off of one of our rigs and top drives due to total loss in march and by depreciation 
capital expenditures of million in included the costs to reactivate five rigs that were held for refurbishment  to replace our rig that was lost to fire in march  and to purchase two new rigs 
in addition  capital expenditures in included costs incurred for drill pipe purchases  betterments and improvements to our rigs  and the purchase of top drives and other capital items 
the increase in shareholders equity is primarily due to the net income for the period offset by repurchases of common stock 
notes the notes bear interest at per annum and mature on may  the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock  upon the occurrence of certain events  at a conversion price of per share  which is equal to a conversion rate of approximately shares per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment 
we will pay contingent interest at a rate equal to per annum during any six month period  with the initial six month period commencing may   if the average trading price of the notes per  principal amount for the five day trading period ending on the third day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month period equals  or more

one of the triggering events permitting note holders to convert their notes into shares of our common stock was met at various times during the years ended december  and that triggering event is if  during any calendar quarter  the closing price per share of our common stock for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter preceding the quarter in which the conversion occurs  is more than of the conversion price per share per share on that th trading day  then the notes become convertible at the note holders option 
during the periods in which the notes were convertible  none of the note holders exercised their right to convert them into shares of our common stock 
as of december  and for the first quarter of  the notes did not meet any of the criteria for convertibility 
floating rate notes on march   we issued million aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes in a private offering that yielded net proceeds of approximately million 
on april   one of the initial purchasers in our private offering of floating rate notes exercised its option to purchase an additional million aggregate principal amount of the floating rate notes with the same terms 
this yielded net proceeds of million 
the floating rate notes bear interest at a per annum rate equal to month libor  adjusted quarterly  minus a spread of but will never be less than zero or more than

cit facility our subsidiary grey wolf drilling company lp has a million credit facility with the cit group business credit  inc the cit facility which expires december  the cit facility  as amended  provides us with the ability to borrow up to the lesser of million or of the orderly liquidation value as defined in the agreement of certain drilling rig equipment located in the contiguous states of the united states of america 
the cit facility is a revolving facility with automatic renewals after expiration unless terminated by the lender on any subsequent anniversary date and then only upon days prior notice 
periodic interest payments are due at a floating rate based upon our debt service coverage ratio within a range of either libor plus to or prime plus to 
the cit facility provides up to million available for letters of credit 
we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee of to per annum on the unused portion of the cit facility 
letters of credit accrue a fee of per annum 
the cit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants and we are in compliance with these covenants 
substantially all of our assets  including our drilling equipment  are pledged as collateral under the cit facility which is also secured by a guarantee of grey wolf  inc and guarantees of certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
we  however  retain the option  subject to a minimum appraisal value  under the cit facility to extract million of the equipment out of the collateral pool in connection with the sale or exchange of such collateral or relocation of equipment outside the contiguous states of the united states of america 
among the various covenants that we must satisfy under the cit facility are the following two covenants as defined in the cit facility which apply whenever our liquidity  defined as the sum of cash  cash equivalents and availability under the cit facility  falls below million to ebitda coverage of debt service  tested monthly on a trailing month basis  and minimum tangible net worth as defined in the cit facility at the end of each quarter will be at least the prior year tangible net worth less non cash write downs since the prior year end and less fixed amounts for each quarter end for which the test is calculated 
at december   our liquidity as defined above was million 
additionally  if the total amount outstanding under the cit facility including outstanding letters of credit exceeds of the orderly liquidation value of our domestic rigs  we are required to make a prepayment in the amount of the excess 
also  if the average 
table of contents rig utilization rate falls below for two consecutive months  the lender will have the option to request one additional appraisal per year to aid in determining the current orderly liquidation value of the drilling equipment 
average rig utilization is defined as the total number of rigs owned which are operating under drilling contracts in the contiguous states of the united states of america divided by the total number of rigs owned  excluding rigs not capable of working without substantial capital investment 
events of default under the cit facility include  in addition to non payment of amounts due  misrepresentations and breach of loan covenants and certain other events including default with respect to other indebtedness in excess of  legal judgments in excess of  or a change in control which means that we cease to own of our two principal subsidiaries  some person or group has either acquired beneficial ownership of or more of the company or obtained the power to elect a majority of our board of directors  or our board of directors ceases to consist of a majority of continuing directors as defined by the cit facility 
the cit facility allows us to repurchase shares of our common stock  pay dividends to our shareholders  and make prepayments on the notes and the floating rate notes 
however  all of the following conditions must be met to enable us to make payments for any of the above mentioned reasons i payments may not exceed million in the aggregate  ii no default or event of default shall exist at the time of any such payments  iii at least million of availability availability under the cit facility plus cash on hand exists immediately after any such payments  and iv we must provide cit group business credit  inc three business days prior written notice of any such payments 
capitalized terms used in the preceding sentence but not defined herein are defined in the cit facility 
as of the date of this report  we did not have an outstanding balance under the cit facility and had million of undrawn  standby letters of credit 
these standby letters of credit are for the benefit of various insurance companies as collateral for premiums and losses which may become payable under the terms of the underlying insurance contracts 
outstanding letters of credit reduce the amount available for borrowing under the cit facility 
cash flow the net cash provided by or used in our operating  investing and financing activities is summarized below amounts in thousands years ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase in cash our cash flows from operating activities are affected by a number of factors including the number of rigs working under contract  whether the contracts are daywork  footage or turnkey  and the rate received for these services 
our cash flow generated from operating activities during the year ended december  was million compared to million during the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to an increase in net income as a result of higher dayrates and rig activity 
our higher activity and dayrates also caused an increase in accounts receivable which partially offset the higher cash flow generated from more net income 
our cash flow generated from operating activities during the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is due to an increase in net income as a result of higher dayrates and rig activity 
cash flow used in investing activities for the year ended december  consisted of million of capital expenditures and million in deposits for new rig purchases  partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of equipment and million in proceeds from an insurance claim on the loss of one rig and top drive 
capital expenditures in included costs for the reactivation of five rigs  replacement of a rig lost to fire and the purchase of two new rigs 
for the year ended december  
table of contents  cash flow used in investing activities consisted of capital expenditures of million  including costs for the reactivation of rigs available for refurbishment 
for the year ended december   cash flow used in investing activities consisted primarily of million of cash paid in the patriot acquisition and million in capital expenditures 
capital expenditures for  and included betterments and improvements to our rigs  the acquisition of drill pipe and drill collars  the purchase of top drives  and other capital items 
cash flow used in financing activities for the year ended december   consisted primarily of million in repurchases of our common stock 
cash flow provided by financing activities for the year ended december   consisted of proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options 
cash flow provided by financing activities for primarily consisted of the net proceeds of million from the issuance of the floating rate notes  partially offset by million for the redemption of the previously outstanding notes

table of contents our cit facility provides up to million for the issuance of letters of credit 
if letters of credit which we cause to be issued are drawn upon by the holders of those letters of credit  then we will become obligated to repay those amounts along with any accrued interest and fees 
letters of credit issued reduce the amount available for borrowing under the cit facility and  as a result  we had borrowing capacity of million at december  the following table illustrates the undrawn outstanding standby letters of credit at december  and the potential maturities if drawn upon by the holders amounts in thousands payments due by period potential total less than over contractual obligation committed year years years years standby letters of credit total assumes no acceleration of maturity date due to breach of  or default under  the potential contractual obligation 
projected cash sources and uses we expect to use cash generated from operations to cover cash requirements  including debt service on the notes and floating rate notes  capital expenditures in  tax payments  and common stock repurchases 
we will make quarterly interest payments on the floating rate notes on january  april  july and october of each year and semi annual interest payments of million on the notes on may and november of each year through the dates of maturity 
to the extent that we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations  we would be required to use cash on hand or draw on our cit facility 
capital expenditures for are projected to be between million and million 
we expect to spend approximately million  net of million of deposits made in  to purchase four new  horsepower drilling rigs 
we have taken delivery of one of these rigs and the other three will be delivered at various times during we have obtained long term contracts on each of these rigs which  in the aggregate  are expected to generate revenue of approximately million over the term of the contracts 
we believe that this revenue will be sufficient to recover  after operating expenses  the purchase price of these rigs 
in addition  our projected capital expenditures for include costs for betterments and improvements to our rigs  the acquisition of drill pipe and drill collars  the purchase of top drives  and other capital items 
results of operations our drilling contracts generally provide compensation on either a daywork  turnkey or footage basis 
successfully completed turnkey and footage contracts generally result in higher revenues per rig day worked than under daywork contracts 
ebitda per rig day worked on successful turnkey and footage jobs are also generally greater than under daywork contracts  although we are typically required to bear additional operating costs such as drill bits that would typically be paid by the customer under daywork contracts 
contract drilling revenues and ebitda on turnkey and footage contracts are affected by a number of variables which include the depth of the well  geological complexities and the actual difficulties encountered in drilling the well 
in the following discussion of the results of our operations and elsewhere in our filings  we use ebitda and ebitda per rig day 
ebitda is a non gaap financial measure under the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec 
we believe that our disclosure of ebitda per rig day as a measure of rig operating performance allows investors to make a direct comparison between us and our competitors  without regard to differences in capital structure or to differences in the cost basis of our rigs and those of our competitors 
investors should be aware  however  that there are limitations inherent in using this performance measure as a measure of overall company profitability because it excludes significant expense items such as depreciation expense and interest expense 
an improving trend in ebitda per rig day may not be indicative of an improvement in our overall profitability 
to compensate for the limitations in utilizing ebitda per rig day as an operating measure  our management also uses gaap measures of performance including operating income and net income to evaluate performance but only with respect to the company as a whole and not on a per rig basis 
in accordance with sec rules  we have included below a reconciliation of ebitda to net income applicable to common shares  which is the nearest comparable financial gaap measure 

table of contents years ended december  earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization interest expense total income tax expense net income applicable to common shares the following tables highlight rig days worked  contract drilling revenues and ebitda for our daywork and turnkey operations for the years ended december   and for the year ended december  daywork turnkey operations operations total dollars in thousands  except averages per rig day worked rig days worked contract drilling revenues drilling operations expenses general and administrative expense interest income gain on sale of assets gain on insurance proceeds ebitda averages per rig day worked contract drilling revenues ebitda for the year ended december  daywork turnkey operations operations total dollars in thousands  except averages per rig day worked rig days worked contract drilling revenues drilling operations expenses general and administrative expense interest income gain on sale of assets ebitda averages per rig day worked contract drilling revenues ebitda 
table of contents for the year ended december  daywork turnkey operations operations total dollars in thousands  except averages per rig day worked rig days worked contract drilling revenues drilling operations expenses general and administrative expense interest income gain on sale of assets ebitda averages per rig day worked contract drilling revenues ebitda turnkey operations include the results from turnkey and footage contracts 
these income and expense items are not contract related and are allocated between daywork and turnkey based upon operating rig days 
comparison of fiscal years ended december  and our ebitda increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted from a million increase in ebitda from daywork operations and a million increase in ebitda from turnkey operations 
on a per rig day basis  our total ebitda increased by  or to  in from  in this increase included a  per rig day increase from daywork operations and a  per rig day increase from turnkey operations 
total general and administrative expenses increased by million  due primarily to the expensing of stock options and restricted stock in  as well as to higher payroll and short term incentive costs  and employee retention plans but as a percentage of annual contract drilling revenues  remained essentially unchanged at 
total interest income increased by million due to higher cash balances and higher interest rates in compared to the gain on sale of assets increased by million due mostly to the sale of five rigs held for refurbishment in january the gain on insurance proceeds of million in relates to the proceeds received from the loss of one of our rigs and top drives 
daywork operations the increase in ebitda discussed above was due in part to an increase of  or  rig days worked on daywork contracts during compared to this increase in days was due primarily to overall higher demand for our services and deployment of five rigs previously held for refurbishment 
higher dayrates  however  contributed more significantly to the increase in ebitda with contract drilling revenue per rig day increasing  or 
the increase in dayrates includes the effect of a per rig day wage increase effective may  which was passed on to our customers in the form of higher dayrates 
drilling operations expenses increased overall  and on a per rig day basis  due to higher activity levels  as well as several other factors 
those factors include increases in labor costs due to the above mentioned wage increase  general inflationary cost increases on good and services  higher maintenance and repair costs  and the employee retention program implemented in november of to retain experienced personnel but as a percentage of dayrate contract drilling revenues  dayrate drilling operations expenses decreased to in from in unlike wage increases  we have not passed the cost of our retention bonus program on to our customers as an increase in dayrates 
turnkey operations turnkey ebitda was higher for the year ended december  due to higher revenue in total and on a per rig day basis 
contract drilling revenue per rig day increased  or  with a small portion of this increase on a per rig day basis resulting from the may  wage increase that was passed on to our customers in the form of higher dayrates 
increasing daywork dayrates are considered in our turnkey bid process and resulted in price increases for our turnkey operations 
these price increases resulted in higher revenue 
the increase in 
table of contents ebitda was also impacted by an increase in rig days worked 
rig days worked increased by rig days  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in also  differences in the complexity and success of the wells drilled are a contributing factor to ebitda fluctuations 
during the third and fourth quarter of  we encountered difficulties on certain turnkey contracts  generating losses  which partially offset the increase in ebitda for the year ended december  other depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in depreciation and amortization expense is higher due to capital expenditures made during and  primarily including the cost for rig refurbishments  betterments and improvements to our rigs  the acquisition of drill pipe and rill collars  the purchase of new top drives and other capital items 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in this increase is due primarily to a higher interest rate on our floating rate notes during as compared to our average interest rate was for the year ended as compared to for the year ended there was no change in our debt balance during the year ended december  our income taxes increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase is due to the higher level of income 
we also utilized the majority of our remaining net operating loss carryforwards in for federal tax purposes which has caused a significant increase in current tax expense versus deferred tax expense 
comparison of fiscal years ended december  and our ebitda increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted from a million increase in ebitda from daywork operations and a million increase in ebitda from turnkey operations

total interest income increased by million due to higher cash balances and higher interest rates in compared to daywork operations the increase in ebitda discussed above was due in part to an increase of  or  rig days worked on daywork contracts during compared to this increase in days was due primarily to overall higher demand for our services 
higher dayrates contributed significantly to the increase in ebitda with contract drilling revenue per rig day increasing  or  however  this increase includes approximately average per rig day related to a wage increase effective june  that was passed on to our customers in the form of higher dayrates 
drilling operations expenses increased overall  and on a per rig day basis  due to higher activity levels  as well as several other factors 
those factors include the above mentioned wage increase  crews being kept on the payroll during unanticipated maintenance  the employee retention program implemented in november of and increases in other labor costs

contract drilling revenue per rig day increased  or primarily resulting from higher daywork dayrates  which are considered in our turnkey bidding process 
also  
table of contents differences in the complexity and success of the wells drilled between the two periods contributed to the increased ebitda 
other depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense is higher due to the acquisition of patriot during the second quarter of  and capital expenditures during and for the reactivation of rigs available for refurbishment  betterments and improvements to our rigs  the acquisition of drill pipe and drill collars  and other capital items 
interest expense decreased by million  or  to million for from million for the decrease is due to the issuance of the floating rate notes and subsequent redemption of our notes 
this refinancing resulted in substantial interest savings given the lower interest rate debt outstanding 
in addition  the first half of included a million redemption premium and accelerated amortization of million of deferred financing costs on the notes 
our income tax expense increased by million to million in  from million in the increase is due to the level of income and is also affected by the annual amortization of million in permanent differences related to differences between the financial accounting and tax basis of assets that were purchased in capital stock acquisitions 
the permanent difference will be reduced as these assets are depreciated for financial accounting purposes on a straight line basis over their remaining useful lives of approximately seven years 
as the amortization of these permanent differences is a fixed amount  our book effective tax rate decreased from in to in based upon the level of income 
inflation and changing prices contract drilling revenues do not necessarily track the changes in general inflation as they tend to respond to the level of activity of the oil and natural gas industry in combination with the supply of equipment and the number of competing companies 
capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and natural gas industry  demand for drilling services and to a lesser extent by changes in general inflation 
our daywork contracts generally allow us to pass wage increases  the most significant component of our operating costs  on to our customers in the form of higher dayrates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on the floating rate notes and the cit facility 
the floating rate notes bear interest at a per annum rate which is equal to month libor  adjusted quarterly  minus a spread of 
we had million of the floating rate notes outstanding at december  a change in the interest rate on the floating rate notes would change our interest expense by million on an annual basis 
however  the annual interest on the floating rate notes will never be below zero or more than  which could yield interest expense ranging from zero to million on an annual basis 
interest on borrowings under the cit facility accrues at a variable rate  using either the prime rate plus to or libor plus to  depending upon our debt service coverage ratio for the trailing month period 
we have no outstanding balance under the cit facility at february  and as such have no exposure under this facility to a change in interest rates
