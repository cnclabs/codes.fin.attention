all reportable segments contributed to the sales volume increase  with the most significant increases being realized by the utility support structures  engineered support structures and irrigation segments 
the improvement in gross profit margin gross profit as a percent of sales in over was mainly due to stronger gross profit margins in the coatings segment 
the utility support structures and irrigation segments also recorded slightly higher gross profit margins 
selling  general and administrative sg a spending in increased over levels  mainly as a result of higher employee incentives related to improved operating performance approximately million  increased salary and employee benefit costs approximately million  higher sales commissions associated with the increased sales volumes approximately million and expense related to stock options approximately million that was required to be recorded under the provisions of sfas no 
r  which we adopted during the first quarter of we also incurred million more bad debt expense in  as compared with of this increase  million related to a reversal of bad debt provision for an international irrigation receivable in all reportable segments contributed to the increased operating income in  as compared with the decrease in net interest expense in  as compared with  was primarily due to lower average borrowing levels this year 
average borrowing levels in were approximately million lower than  which resulted from operating cash inflows that were used to pay down our interest bearing debt 
the impact of lower borrowing levels on interest expense were somewhat offset by higher interest rates on our variable rate debt 
the lower effective tax rate in  as compared with  was due in part to million in taxes incurred in due to repatriation of foreign earnings 
we realized approximately million in certain income tax benefits related to credits from prior tax years taken on our income tax returns in we had previously determined it was not probable that these tax benefits would be realized and therefore had not recognized these benefits in prior years 
in addition  we realized an increase in the amount of our pre tax earnings derived from foreign locations in  as compared with these foreign locations generally have lower statutory income tax rates than the us  contributing to the overall lower effective income tax rate in  as compared with miscellaneous income in was higher than  due mainly to a million settlement associated with a retirement plan of a former subsidiary in the first quarter of we realized a loss in our nonconsolidated subsidiaries in  due principally to losses in our owned structures operation in mexico 
the mexican loss mainly related to adjustment of receivable and inventory valuations in the third quarter of  which reduced our share of earnings from this nonconsolidated subsidiary by million after tax 
in the fourth quarter of  we purchased the remaining of this subsidiary for million net of cash acquired  plus approximately million in interest bearing debt and certain amounts due to the majority owner 
all of the million in assumed debts were repaid at the closing of the transaction 
our cash flows provided by operations were million in  as compared with million in the lower operating cash flows in resulted from increased working capital required by the increased net sales realized in and a larger share of our income tax expense that was payable in cash  as opposed to being deferred to later periods 
the operating cash flow realized in in part was related to a significant inventory increase in  which was related to widespread shortages in steel in steel availability improved in  which resulted in reduced inventory and  accordingly  improved operating cash flow in  as compared with engineered support structures ess segment general the sales increase in the ess segment in  as compared with  was due to higher sales in all geographic regions 
on a product line basis  the sales increase mainly resulted from stronger sales demand in the lighting and traffic and specialty product lines 
the increased gross profit of the ess segment in  as compared with  was mainly related to the stronger sales and operating performance in china  due to a combination of higher sales of communication structures in china and stronger shipments of utility structures into export markets 
improved sales and gross profit margins in the north american and european lighting markets also contributed to the improvement in operating income 
operational difficulties in our north american locations that are dedicated to specialty structures negatively affected ess segment operating income 
in  we incurred an aggregate of approximately million in expenses in this product line associated with warranty claims on sign structures in north america  receivable and inventory valuation provisions and the writeoff of the sigma trade name 
in addition  segment profitability was negatively affected by approximately million related to production equipment disposals and employee severance costs in europe 
the main reasons for the increase in sg a expense in  as compared with were increased salary and employee benefit cost expenses million  commissions related to higher sales volumes million  increased international management expenses million and the writeoff of the sigma trade name million in lighting and traffic products in north america  lighting and traffic structure sales in improved modestly over in the transportation market  while sales were essentially flat as compared with  higher sales order levels achieved after the passage of us highway funding legislation in the third quarter of have resulted in an increased backlog as of december  commercial lighting sales volumes in were higher than  as improvements in the residential and commercial construction markets resulted in higher demand for street and area lighting structures 
the improvement in commercial lighting structure sales was also due to increased demand for decorative lighting structures and expanded relationships with lighting fixture manufacturers 
in europe  lighting sales in were higher than  mainly due to new tramway and decorative lighting structures developed for the european market and improvement in economic conditions in our main market areas 
specialty products in the specialty structures product line  the increase in sales  as compared with  was mainly due to increased sales in wireless communication structures outside of north america 
sales of wireless communication structures and components in north america in were comparable to sign structure sales in were slightly lower than sales of wireless communication structures in china were higher in  as compared with a relatively weak the chinese wireless communication carriers are continuing their investment in structures as part of their plans to improve their coverage and increase services provided to their customers 
utility products this product line includes sales of utility structures for markets outside of north america 
in  the sales increase as compared with was mainly due to export sales of utility structures 
our chinese operations are an important factor in our efforts to compete effectively in these export markets 
in addition  we believe china will continue to increase its investment in basic infrastructure  including electrical energy generation  transmission and distribution 
accordingly  we believe that future demand for our steel structures for these applications will grow 
utility support structures segment in the utility support structures segment  the sales increase in as compared with was due to improved demand for steel and concrete electrical transmission  substation and distribution pole structures 
throughout and into  our order rates for structures from utility companies and independent power producers were relatively strong  as increased emphasis on improving the electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure in the us has resulted in increased demand for structures for those applications 
we also believe that incentives in energy legislation enacted in have encouraged utility companies to invest in their transmission and distribution systems 
all of these factors resulted in substantially improved sales orders  shipments and backlogs in  as compared with gross profit increased at a slightly higher rate than sales in  as compared with due to the strong sales growth in this segment  we were able to realize improved factory productivity to effectively leverage our fixed factory cost structure  although gross profit margins were dampened somewhat by rising material costs applied to certain fixed price sales contracts 
the growth in operating income in  as compared with  related mainly to the growth in sales and leverage of our fixed sg a cost structure 
the main reasons for the increased sg a spending in  as compared with  were increased salary and employee benefit costs million and commission expenses related to higher sales million 
effective november   we acquired the remaining of the shares of our steel pole manufacturing joint venture located in monterrey  mexico 
this operation was not consolidated in our financial statements until november and did not have a significant impact on segment sales and operating income in coatings segment the increase in coatings segment sales in  as compared with  was due to higher sales prices associated with higher zinc costs 
sales volume measured in physical volume of materials processed was up modestly from in  zinc prices were volatile and increased to record levels during the year  especially early in we believe we were successful in recovering our increased zinc costs in the form of higher sales prices 
the increase in operating income in  as compared with  was principally due to improved production efficiencies related to zinc and facility utilization 
gross profit and operating income in also included a million gain associated with the sale of one of our production facilities 
this facility represented excess capacity for us and this sale should not affect our ability to serve our markets 
the increase in sg a spending in  as compared with  was primarily related to higher employee incentives associated with improved operating income 
irrigation segment the sales in the irrigation segment rebounded from a weak the sales increase was due to a combination of higher sales volumes and increased selling prices to recover increased raw material costs 
in north america  improving farm commodity prices and relatively dry growing conditions contributed to modestly improved demand for irrigation machines in  as compared with we believe the increase in year to date sales of irrigation machines and service parts in over levels also resulted from an increase of equipment damaged in winter storms in late international sales in increased approximately over  mainly due to sales in newly developed international markets and generally improved market conditions in africa and latin america over the increase in operating income in over was the result of improved sales volumes and effective control of sg a spending 
the increase in sg a expense from to was mainly attributable to increased employee incentives associated with improved operational performance million and increased bad debts provisions of million in over the increased bad debts provision included a million reversal of an international accounts receivable provision that was realized in the second quarter of tubing segment the increase in tubing sales in  as compared with  was due to improved demand for tubing products 
despite higher sales volumes  gross profit in was essentially unchanged from  due to a competitive pricing environment for certain commodity type tubing products 
sg a spending in was lower than  due to reduced employee incentives related to less operating income improvement this year 
other this segment includes our industrial fastener business  our machine tool accessories operation in france and the development costs associated with our wind energy structure initiative 
the main reason for the improvement in operating income this year was approximately million in improved profitability of our machine tool accessory business 
our expenses related to the development of a structure for the wind energy industry in were lower than by approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of  we made the decision to suspend our efforts in this area 
the main reasons for this decision was that projected economic returns for us were not sufficient to warrant further development at this time 
as a result  we recorded a million charge to operating income in the fourth quarter of  related mainly to inventory valuation adjustments associated with this decision 
net corporate expense the increase in net corporate expenses in  as compared with  was mainly related to increased employee incentives due to improved earnings this year approximately million  increased occupancy cost related to our corporate headquarters facility million and stock option expense recognized in of million 
approximately million of the occupancy cost increase was related to the termination of our synthetic lease on the corporate headquarters building and release of the related residual value guarantee 
fiscal compared with fiscal overview the fiscal year ended december  included weeks of operations  as compared with fiscal  which was weeks 
this was the result of our fiscal year end being on the last saturday in december 
accordingly  all fiscal operational figures were higher than had fiscal been weeks in length 
the estimated impact on our net sales and net earnings due to the extra week of fiscal was approximately million and million  respectively 
in  we completed the acquisitions of newmark international  inc newmark  a manufacturer of concrete and steel pole structures mainly for the north america utility industry  wj whatley  inc whatley  a manufacturer of fiberglass poles principally for outdoor lighting applications and the assets of sigma industries  inc sigma  a manufacturer of overhead sign structures mainly serving the eastern united states 
newmark is reported as part of the utility support structures segment and whatley and sigma are reported as part of the engineered support structures ess segment 
the results of these operations were included in our consolidated results starting on the closing dates of the acquisitions 
the newmark and whatley acquisitions were completed in the second quarter of and the sigma acquisition was completed in the third quarter of consolidated net sales increased as compared with due to a full year impact of acquisitions completed in million and higher selling prices associated with the rapid increase of steel costs throughout much of these net sales increases were offset somewhat by decreased sales volumes in the irrigation segment in  as compared with gross profit as a percent of sales increased  mainly resulting from the impact of higher selling prices 
in  our gross profit as a percent of net sales fell in our engineered support structures ess and utility support structures segments  as pricing actions taken in response to higher steel costs lagged steel cost increases 
in  gross profit percentages in these segments recovered to more historical levels  as steel costs were more stable in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased in over levels  mainly due to the full year impact of the acquisitions completed in million  increased employee incentives of million due to increased profitability in  increased sales commissions associated with higher sales million and additional personnel costs related to the preparation of our new ess segment operation in china approximately million 
this plant is scheduled to begin production in the second quarter of net interest expense increased in mainly due to higher interest rates on our variable rate debt  as compared with approximately million 
higher average borrowing levels in as compared to  due to the million of debt incurred to fund the acquisitions completed in also contributed to the increase in net interest expense 
the effective tax rate increased in due to million in taxes due to repatriation of foreign earnings 
on october   the american jobs creation act ajca was signed into law  which included a deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the ajca 
we elected to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in fiscal the cash dividends received in net of taxes paid was approximately million 
otherwise  our effective tax rate in was essentially unchanged from minority interest expenses were lower in than mainly due to lower earnings in our irrigation segment operations in brazil and south africa 
in addition  we increased our ownership interest in the brazil operation from to in  which contributed to lower minority interest expenses as compared with net earnings increased in due in part to a million pre tax expense in approximately million after taxes associated with the restructuring of our long term debt in earnings per share increased at a lower percentage than net earnings in from due to more fully diluted shares outstanding 
engineered support structures ess segment general the sales increase in as compared with was due to price increases related to steel cost increases and the full year impact in from the acquisitions million 
the improvement in gross profit mainly related to sales price increases 
in  we raised sales prices as our steel costs increased 
however  the impact of sales price increases generally lagged our cost increases  resulting in lower gross profit margins in sales prices lagged cost increases due to the backlog nature of our business and existing orders could not be re priced 
in  steel costs were more stable  which enabled our gross profit margins to improve to more traditional levels 
increased sg a spending principally resulted from the full year impact of higher employee incentives attributable to improved operating income in  as compared with million  the acquisitions million  and increased compensation costs in china to prepare for the start up of our second plant approximately million 
this plant is scheduled to begin production in the second quarter of all regions contributed to the improved operating income for the segment 
in europe  earnings improved by million as compared with due to increased volumes and cost structure reductions implemented in china s earnings improved million which was attributable to higher sales volumes and improved product pricing 
lighting and traffic products the increase in north american lighting and traffic structure sales in was partly due to the effect of a full year of activity from the acquisitions of whatley million and the full year impact of price increases implemented in in response to higher steel costs 
north american volumes were slightly down in as compared with we believe delays in the enactment of the highway bill in the us resulted in postponement of lighting projects and reduced demand in the transportation market 
the commercial lighting market remained stable in in europe  lighting sales were higher than due to a combination of higher selling prices to offset higher steel costs and an approximate volume increase due to improvement in economic conditions in our main market areas and sales of new products developed this year 
specialty products sales of specialty products were up from  mainly due to the full year of the acquisition of sigma approximately million 
wireless communication structures and components remained fairly stable in as compared to  reflecting relatively stable market conditions 
sales of wireless communication poles in china were down slightly from a very strong utility products this product line includes sales of utility structures for markets outside of north america 
sales improved in as compared with due to introduction of new utility structure products for the chinese market and export sales of utility structures outside of china 
we believe as china develops its electrical infrastructure  there will be a solid demand in the future for steel transmission  substation and distribution structures to help transport and distribute electrical power to users 
furthermore  we believe that china will continue to be a key part of our efforts to penetrate export utility structure markets 
utility support structures segment this segment includes the operations of newmark since its acquisition on april  and the north american utility structure operations that were previously part of the ess segment 
the increase in sales from to includes approximately million related to the full year impact of the newmark acquisition and the effect of increased selling prices to offset higher steel costs incurred in while sales volumes were comparable to  order rates were well above levels 
increased investment in the electrical transmission grid by utility companies and independent power producers resulted in higher order rates and backlogs in  as compared with gross profit improved in over  as margins returned to more traditional levels through increased pricing  while volumes were comparable to increased sg a expense in resulted from the full year impact of newmark million  increased incentives of million due to increased segment earnings and increased commissions of million due to increased segment sales in coatings segment coatings segment sales were slightly down in from mainly due to lower volumes  but favorably offset by higher prices due in part to increased zinc and natural gas costs that were passed on to the marketplace as price increases or surcharges 
gross profit improved mainly through increased factory productivity and lower workers compensation costs in  as compared with  of approximately million in our california operations 
improved safety procedures and changes in california workers compensation laws contributed to decreased workers compensation costs in irrigation segment sales were down in as compared to due to lower sales volumes in both domestic and international markets  partially offset by higher sales prices 
in north america  irrigation machine sales volumes were down approximately in  as compared with we believe relatively low farm commodity prices and higher input costs energy  fuel and fertilizer contributed to reduced demand for irrigation machines in most of our key markets around the world 
additionally  a weak us dollar also contributed to reduced sales demand in our international markets 
on a regional basis  sales decreases in south america and south africa were somewhat offset by improved sales in the asia pacific region 
gross profit decreased more than sales in  as compared with  due to decreased factory productivity associated with the decreased sales volumes 
the impact of lower factory productivity on gross profit was approximately million in in  sg a expenses decreased from due to reduced employee incentives associated with decreased operating income approximately million and to a bad debt reversal of million for a receivable that was recovered in tubing segment tubing segment sales increased in due to improved demand  partially offset by lower pricing  in certain markets 
gross profit was comparable to  despite the increase in sales volume 
gross profit margins were hampered in  as compared with  due to lower pricing and an unfavorable sales mix  partially offset by improved factory performance approximately million 
sg a expense was down in  due to decreased employee incentives resulting from lower growth in segment earnings 
other our other businesses include our machine tool accessory business in france  our industrial fastener business in the us  and wind energy development 
operating income decreased mainly due to increased research and development spending to develop a structure for the wind energy industry 
our spending on the wind energy initiative was million in  as compared with million in net corporate expense the most significant items that resulted in the increase in net corporate expense in as compared with were increased employee incentives of million related to improved net earnings in and approximately million related to the acquisition of a new corporate aircraft and the sale of our existing aircraft in liquidity and capital resources cash flows working capital and operating cash flows net working capital was million at fiscal year end  as compared with million at fiscal year end the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was as of december  as compared with at december  operating cash flow was million in  as compared with million in and million in the lower operating cash flows in resulted from increased working capital required by the increased net sales realized in and a larger amount of our income tax expense that was payable in cash  as opposed to being deferred to later periods 
investing cash flows capital spending was million in  as compared with million in  and million in the most significant capital spending projects in related to our new structures manufacturing plant in china million  business system investments in the ess segment million  molds for the manufacture of concrete utility structures million and investment in new galvanizing equipment million 
the most significant capital expenditure in was the purchase of a corporate aircraft for million  which replaced an aircraft that was sold for approximately million in cash 
our depreciation and amortization expenses for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
throughout much of the s our capital spending was relatively high as we added manufacturing capacity in a number of areas  most notably our irrigation segment factory in mccook  nebraska and our utility support structures factory in jasper  tennessee 
we have not made any substantial capacity additions in the past three years  except for a new ess segment manufacturing facility in southern china 
in addition  we made a number of acquisitions from through that added capacity and allowed us to expand our market coverage 
due mainly to the large growth in the utility support structures segment  we will be investing in additional manufacturing capacity for large steel poles to meet the market demand in this segment 
accordingly  our capital expenditures are estimated to be between and million 
we also made other investments and acquisitions over the past three years 
in  we invested a total of million in our mexican pole manufacturing joint venture  including million net of cash acquired for the remaining ownership in this entity 
the most significant investing cash flow item in was the million expended net of cash acquired related to the newmark  whatley and sigma acquisitions 
financing cash flows total interest bearing debt decreased from million in to million as of december  most of this decrease related to scheduled debt repayments of our existing debt  offset to a degree by increased short term borrowing to fund working capital needs in china and to finance the acquisition of the remaining of the shares of our mexican pole structures manufacturing joint venture 
the increase in interest bearing debt in was due to our acquisitions  which totaled million including million in debt that was assumed as part of the acquisitions 
sources of financing and capital we have historically funded our growth  capital spending and acquisitions through a combination of operating cash flows and debt financing 
we have an internal long term objective to maintain long term debt as a percent of capital at or below 
at december   our long term debt to invested capital ratio was  as compared with at the end of fiscal this internal objective is exceeded from time to time in order to take advantage of opportunities to grow and improve our businesses 
we believe the acquisitions described above were appropriate opportunities to expand our market coverage and product offerings and generate earnings growth 
while our long term debt to capital ratio exceeded our objective as a result of the newmark acquisition in april  our cash flows enabled us to reduce our long term debt levels to under of invested capital by september dependent on our level of acquisition activity and steel industry availability and pricing issues  we expect our long term debt to invested capital ratio to remain below in our priorities in use of future cash flows are as follows fund internal growth initiatives in core businesses pay down interest bearing debt invest in acquisitions clearly connected to our core businesses or an existing competency return money to our shareholders through increased dividends or common stock repurchases at appropriate share prices our debt financing at december  consisted mainly of long term debt 
we also maintain certain short term bank lines of credit totaling million  million of which was unused at december  our long term debt principally consists of million of senior subordinated notes that bear interest at per annum and are due in may we may repurchase the notes starting in may at specified prepayment premiums 
these notes are guaranteed by certain of our us subsidiaries 
million revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that accrues interest at our option at a the higher of the prime lending rate and the federal funds rate plus basis points or b an interest rate spread over the libor of to basis points inclusive of facility fees  depending on our ratio of debt to earnings before taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
in addition  this agreement provides that another million may be added to the total credit agreement at our request at any time prior to may   subject to the group of banks increasing their current commitment 
at december  and december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement has a termination date of may  and contains certain financial covenants that limit our additional borrowing capability under the agreement 
at december   we had the ability to borrow an additional million under this facility 
term loan with a group of banks that accrues interest at our option at a the higher of the prime lending rate and the federal funds rate plus basis points or b libor plus a spread of to basis points  depending on our debt to ebitda ratio and had an outstanding balance of million at december  this loan requires quarterly principal payments through the annualized principal payments beginning in in millions are   and the effective interest rate on this loan was per annum at december  under these debt agreements  we are obligated by covenants that require us to maintain certain coverage ratios and may limit us with respect to certain business activities  including capital expenditures 
our key debt covenants are that interest bearing debt is not to exceed x ebitda of the prior four quarters and that our ebitda over our prior four quarters must be at least x our interest expense over the same period 
at december  we were in compliance with all covenants related to these debt agreements 
based on our available credit facilities and our history of positive cash flows from operations  we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our needs 
financial obligations and financial commitments we have future financial obligations related to payment of principal and interest on interest bearing debt  including capital lease obligations  various operating leases and purchase obligations 
these obligations as of december  are summarized as follows  in millions of dollars contractual obligations total after long term debt capital leases unconditional purchase obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations long term debt principally consists of the million of senior subordinated notes and the bank term loan million was outstanding at december  
we had no outstanding balance on our revolving credit agreement at december  obligations under these agreements could be accelerated in event of non compliance with covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
capital leases relate principally to a production facility in france and office equipment 
operating leases relate mainly to various production and office facilities and are in the normal course of business 
as of december  interest obligations associated with our long term debt and capital leases were as follows in millions of dollars after unconditional purchase obligations relate to purchase orders for zinc  aluminum and steel  most of which will be used in we believe the quantities under contract are reasonable in light of normal fluctuations in business levels and we expect to use the commodities under contract during the contract period 
off balance sheet arrangements we have operating lease obligations to unaffiliated parties on leases of certain production and office facilities and equipment 
these leases are in the normal course of business and generally contain no substantial obligations for us at the end of the lease contracts 
we also have certain commercial commitments related to contingent events that could create a financial obligation for us 
our commitments at december  were as follows in millions of dollars commitment expiration period other commercial commitments total amounts committed thereafter standby letters of credit total commercial commitments the above commitments are loan guarantees of a non consolidated subsidiary in argentina that is accompanied by a guarantee from the majority owner to us 
we also maintain standby letters of credit for contract performance on certain sales contracts 
market risk changes in prices certain key materials we use are commodities traded in worldwide markets and are subject to fluctuations in price 
the most significant materials are steel  aluminum  zinc and natural gas 
over the last several years  prices for these commodities have been volatile 
in  prices for hot rolled steel products rose dramatically throughout much of the year 
the volatility in these prices was due to such factors as fluctuations in supply  government tariffs and the costs of steel making inputs 
we have also experienced volatility in natural gas prices in the past several years  especially in and  zinc prices rose rapidly throughout the year  reaching record high prices in our main strategies in managing these risks are a combination of fixed price purchase contracts with our vendors to reduce the volatility in our purchase prices and sales price increases where possible 
we use natural gas swap contracts to mitigate the impact of rising gas prices on our operating income 
in  our strategies as they pertain to steel were not as effective as in the past  as suppliers discontinued fixed price contracts and consignment programs 
risk management market risk the principal market risks affecting us are exposure to interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and natural gas 
we normally do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge these exposures except as described below  nor do we use derivatives for trading purposes 
interest rates our interest bearing debt is a mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
assuming average interest rates and borrowings on variable rate debt  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have an impact on interest expense of approximately million in and million in foreign exchange exposures to transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity s functional currency are not material  and therefore the potential exchange losses in future earnings  fair value and cash flows from these transactions are immaterial 
much of our cash in non us entities is denominated in foreign currencies  where fluctuations in exchange rates will impact cash balances in us dollar terms 
a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar would impact our reported cash balance by approximately million in and million in we manage our investment risk in foreign operations by borrowing in the functional currencies of the foreign entities where appropriate 
the following table indicates the change in the recorded value of our investments at year end assuming a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar 
in millions europe asia south america mexico south africa commodity risk natural gas is a significant commodity used in our factories  especially in our coatings segment galvanizing operations  where natural gas is used to heat tanks that enable the hot dipped galvanizing process 
natural gas prices are volatile and we mitigate some of this volatility through the use of derivative commodity instruments 
our current policy is to manage this commodity price risk for of our us natural gas requirements for the upcoming months through the purchase of natural gas swaps based on nymex futures prices for delivery in the month being hedged 
the objective of this policy is to mitigate the impact on our earnings of sudden  significant increases in the price of natural gas 
annual us gas requirements are approximately  mmbtu 
we have purchased swaps totaling approximately of our expected us requirements through february the fair value of these instruments is based on quoted market prices from the nymex 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in price 
as of december  our market risk exposure related to future natural gas requirements being hedged was approximately million based on a sensitivity analysis 
changes in the market value of these derivative instruments have a high correlation to changes in the spot price of natural gas 
since we forward price only a portion of our natural gas requirements  this hypothetical adverse impact on natural gas derivative instruments would be more than offset by lower costs for all natural gas we purchase 
critical accounting policies the following accounting policies involve judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
there is a substantial amount of management judgment used in preparing financial statements 
we must make estimates on a number of items  such as provisions for bad debts  warranties  contingencies  impairments of long lived assets  and inventory obsolescence 
we base our estimates on our experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
further  we re evaluate our estimates from time to time and as circumstances change 
actual results may differ under different assumptions or conditions 
the selection and application of our critical accounting policies are discussed annually with our audit committee 
allowance for doubtful accounts in determining an allowance for accounts receivable that will not ultimately be collected in full  we consider age of the accounts receivable customer credit history customer financial information reasons for non payment product  service or billing issues 
if our customers financial condition was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
warranties all of our businesses must meet certain product quality and performance criteria 
we rely on historical product claims data to estimate the cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
in determining the accrual for the estimated cost of warranty claims  we consider our experience with costs to correct the product problem in the field  including labor costs costs for replacement parts other direct costs associated with warranty claims the number of product units subject to warranty claims in addition to known claims or warranty issues  we estimate future claims on recent sales 
the key assumption in our estimate is the rate we apply to those recent sales  which is based on historical claims experience 
if this estimated rate changed by  the impact on operating income would be approximately million 
if our cost to repair a product or the number of products subject to warranty claims is greater than we estimated  then we would have to increase our accrued cost for warranty claims 
inventories we use the last in first out lifo method to determine the value of the majority of our inventory 
approximately of inventory is valued at the lower of cost  determined by the lifo method 
the remaining of our inventory is valued on a first in first out fifo basis 
in periods of rising costs to produce inventory  the lifo method will result in lower profits than fifo  because higher more recent costs are recorded to cost of goods sold than under the fifo method 
conversely  in periods of falling costs to produce inventory  the lifo method will result in higher profits than the fifo method 
in and  we experienced substantially higher costs to produce inventory than in the prior respective years  due mainly to higher costs for steel  steel related products and zinc 
this resulted in higher cost of goods sold and lower operating income in and of approximately million and million  respectively  than had our entire inventory been valued on the fifo method 
the prices decreased modestly and operating income would have decreased by approximately million had our entire inventory been valued on the fifo method 
we write down slow moving and obsolete inventory by the difference between the value of the inventory and our estimate of the reduced value based on potential future uses  the likelihood that overstocked inventory will be sold and the expected selling prices of the inventory 
if our ability to realize value on slow moving or obsolete inventory is less favorable than assumed  additional write downs of the inventory may be required 
depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets that were acquired in business acquisitions 
we have assigned useful lives to our property  plant and equipment and certain intangible assets ranging from to years 
we annually evaluate our reporting units for goodwill impairment during the third fiscal quarter  which coincides with our strategic planning process 
we value our reporting units using after tax cash flows from operations less capital expenditures discounted to present value 
the key assumptions are the discount rate and the annual free cash flow 
we also use sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of changes in discount rates and cash flow forecasts on the valuation of the reporting units 
as allowed for under sfas no 
 we rely on our previous valuations for the annual impairment testing provided that the following criteria for each reporting unit are met the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting unit have not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination and the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin 
in the case of most of our reporting units  the above criteria have been met and no further evaluation was required 
if our assumptions about intangible assets change as a result of events or circumstances  and we believe the assets may have declined in value  then we may record impairment charges  resulting in lower profits 
our indefinite lived intangible assets consist of trade names and their values are separately assessed from goodwill as part of the annual impairment testing 
this assessment is made using the relief from royalty method  under which the value of a trade name is determined based on a royalty that could be charged to a third party for using the trade name in question 
the royalty  which is based on a reasonable rate applied against forecasted sales  is tax effected and discounted to present value 
the most significant assumptions in this evaluation include estimated future sales  the royalty rate and the after tax discount rate 
for our evaluation purposes  the royalty rates used vary between and of sales and the after tax discount rate of  which we estimate to be our after tax cost of capital 
stock options our employees are periodically granted stock options by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
in fiscal  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  the compensation cost of all employee stock based compensation awards is measured based on the grant date fair value of those awards and that cost is recorded as compensation expense over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award generally over the vesting period of the award 
the valuation of stock option awards is complex in that there are a number of variables included in the calculation of the value of a stock option award volatility of our stock price expected term of the option expected dividend yield risk free interest rate over the expected term expected number of options that will not vest we have elected to use a binomial pricing model in the valuation of our stock options because we believe it provides a more accurate measure of the value of employee stock options 
the assumptions used in our valuation of stock options were as follows in and volatility expected term from vesting date yrs yrs 
risk free interest rate dividend yield these variables are developed using a combination of our internal data with respect to stock price volatility and exercise behavior of option holders and information from outside sources 
the development of each of these variables requires a significant amount of judgment 
changes in the values of the above variables will result in different option valuations and  therefore  different amounts of compensation cost 
the per share value of options granted in was higher using the assumptions  than if the assumptions had been used 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
future taxable income expectations and tax planning strategies are considered in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if a deferred tax asset is estimated to be not fully realizable in the future  a valuation allowance to decrease the amount of the deferred tax asset would decrease net income in the period the determination was made 
likewise  if we subsequently determine that we would be able to realize all or part of a net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment reducing the valuation allowance would increase net earnings in the period such determination was made 
at december   we had approximately million in deferred tax assets related mainly to operating and tax credit carryforwards  with a valuation allowance of million 
in  we removed million of prior valuation allowances and  accordingly  reduced our income tax expense  because we determined that  based on facts and circumstances  the realization of these deferred tax assets was more likely than not 
if these circumstances change in the future  we may be required to increase or decrease the valuation allowance on these assets  resulting in an increase or decrease in income tax expense and a reduction or increase in net income 
at december   we had deferred tax assets of million related to nonconsolidated subsidiaries 
these deferred tax assets relate to operating loss carryforwards 
we do not believe that the future earnings prospects of these entities will be adequate on a more likely than not basis to utilize these carryforwards before they expire 
accordingly  these deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation adjustment 
we are subject to examination by taxing authorities in the various countries in which we operate 
the tax years subject to examination vary by jurisdiction 
we regularly consider the likelihood of additional income tax assessments in each of these taxing jurisdictions based on our experiences related to prior audits and our understanding of the facts and circumstances of the related tax issues 
we include in current income tax expense any changes to accruals for potential tax deficiencies 
if our judgments related to tax deficiencies are different than actual experience  our income tax expense could increase or decrease in a given fiscal period 
recently issued accounting pronouncements fin in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes guidance regarding the recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return 
the recognition threshold will require us to determine whether it is more likely than not that a given tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority 
if the tax position in question meets the recognition threshold  the position is measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement of a tax position 
the interpretation is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of upon adoption  we anticipate that the total amount of accrued tax liabilities will increase by up to million 
this change will be a reduction to the january  balance of retained earnings 
these estimates include accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits 
sfas in september  the fasb issued statement sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
while sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements  it may change the application of fair value measurements embodied in other accounting standards 
sfas no 
will be effective at the beginning of our fiscal year 
we are currently assessing the effect of this pronouncement on the consolidated financial statements
