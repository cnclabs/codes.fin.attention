general 
westfield financial s consolidated results of operations are comprised of earnings on investments and the net income recorded by its principal operating subsidiary  westfield bank 
westfield bank s consolidated results of operations depend primarily on net interest and dividend income 
net interest and dividend income is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
interest earning assets consist primarily of commercial real estate loans  commercial and industrial loans  residential real estate loans  consumer loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities 
interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of certificates of deposit and money market account  now account and savings account deposits and borrowings from the federal home loan bank of boston 
the consolidated results of operations also depend on provision for loan losses  noninterest income  and noninterest expense 
noninterest expense includes salaries and employee benefits  occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses 
noninterest income includes service fees and charges  income on bank owned life insurance  and gains losses on sales of securities and securities writedowns 
critical accounting policies 
westfield financial s accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
given westfield financial s current business strategy and asset liability structure  the more critical policies are accounting for nonperforming loans  the allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses  the classification of securities as either held to maturity or available for sale  other than temporary impairment of securities  and discount rate assumptions used for benefit liabilities 
in addition to the informational disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  westfield financial s policy on each of these accounting policies is described in detail in the applicable sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the related disclosures with the audit committee of westfield financial s board of directors 
on a quarterly basis  westfield financial reviews available for sale investment securities with unrealized depreciation on a judgmental basis to assess whether the decline in fair value is temporary or other than temporary 
declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  management considers the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability of westfield financial to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
securities  including mortgage backed securities  which management has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
securities  including mortgage backed securities  that have been identified as assets for which there is not a positive intent to hold to maturity are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of income taxes  reported as a separate component of equity 
accordingly  a misclassification would have a direct effect on stockholders equity 
sales or reclassification as available for sale except for certain permitted reasons of held to maturity securities may result in the reclassification of all such securities to available for sale 
westfield financial has never sold held to maturity securities or reclassified such securities to available for sale other than in specifically permitted circumstances 
westfield financial does not acquire securities or mortgage backed securities for purposes of engaging in trading activities 
westfield financial s general policy is to discontinue the accrual of interest when principal or interest payments are delinquent days or more  or earlier if the loan is considered impaired 
any unpaid amounts previously accrued on these loans are reversed from income 
subsequent cash receipts are applied to the outstanding principal balance or to interest income if  in the judgment of management  collection of principal balance is not in question 
loans are returned to accrual status when they become current as to both principal and interest and when subsequent performance reduces the concern as to the collectibility of principal and interest 
loan fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred  and the net fee or cost is recognized as an adjustment to interest income over the estimated average lives of the related loans 
the process of evaluating the loan portfolio  classifying loans and determining the allowance and provision is described in detail in business of westfield financial and westfield bank lending activities allowance for loan losses 
westfield financial s methodology for assessing the allocation of the allowance consists of two key components  which are a specific allowance for identified problems or impaired loans and a formula allowance for the remainder of the portfolio 
measurement of impairment can be based on present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change 
the allocation of the allowance is also reviewed by management based upon its evaluation of then existing economic and business conditions affecting westfield financial s key lending areas and other conditions  such as new loan products  credit quality trends including trends in nonperforming loans expected to result from existing conditions  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  specific industry conditions within portfolio segments that existed as of the balance sheet date and the impact that such conditions were believed to have had on the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
although management believes it has established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels  future adjustments may be necessary if economic  real estate and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment

westfield financial does not anticipate any material capital expenditures during calendar year  nor do we have any balloon or other payments due on any long term obligations or any off balance sheet items other than the commitments and unused lines of credit noted above

management of market risk as a financial institution  westfield financial s primary market risk is interest rate risk since substantially all transactions are denominated in us dollars with no direct foreign exchange or changes in commodity price exposure 
fluctuations in interest rates will affect both our level of income and expense on a large portion of our assets and liabilities 
fluctuations in interest rates will also affect the market value of all interest earning assets 
the primary goal of westfield financial s interest rate management strategy is to limit fluctuations in net interest income as interest rates vary up or down and control variations in the market value of assets  liabilities and net worth as interest rates vary 
westfield financial seeks to coordinate asset and liability decisions so that  under changing interest rate scenarios  net interest income will remain within an acceptable range 
to achieve the objectives of managing interest rate risk  westfield bank s asset and liability management committee meets monthly to discuss and monitor the market interest rate environment relative to interest rates that are offered on its products 
the asset and liability management committee presents periodic reports to the board of directors of westfield bank and westfield financial  inc at their regular meetings 
in recent years  westfield bank s lending activities have emphasized commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans 
commercial real estate loans have grown million or since december  commercial and industrial loans have grown million or since december  consumer loans decreased million  or  since december  management curtailed its indirect lending beginning in fiscal year and in the fourth quarter of the program was discontinued 
management believes that westfield bank s increased emphasis on commercial lending has allowed it to diversify its loan portfolio while continuing to meet the needs of the businesses and individuals that it serves 
westfield bank s primary source of funds has been deposits  consisting primarily of time deposits  money market accounts  savings accounts  demand accounts and now accounts  which have shorter terms to maturity than the loan portfolio 
several strategies have been employed to manage the interest rate risk inherent in the asset liability mix  including but not limited to o maintaining the diversity of westfield bank s existing loan portfolio through the origination of commercial loans and commercial real estate loans which typically have variable rates and shorter terms than residential mortgages  and o emphasizing investments with an expected average duration of five years or less 
in addition  emphasis on commercial loans has reduced the average maturity of westfield bank s loan portfolio 
moreover  the actual amount of time before loans are repaid can be significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
prepayment rates will also vary due to a number of other factors  including the regional economy in the area where the loans were originated  seasonal factors  demographic variables and the assumability of the loans 
however  the major factors affecting prepayment rates are prevailing interest rates  related financing opportunities and competition 
westfield financial monitors interest rate sensitivity so that it can adjust its asset and liability mix in a timely manner and minimize the negative effects of changing rates 
each of westfield bank s sources of liquidity is vulnerable to various uncertainties beyond the control of westfield bank 
scheduled loan and security payments are a relatively stable source of funds  while loan and security prepayments and calls  and deposit flows vary widely in reaction to market conditions  primarily prevailing interest rates 
asset sales are influenced by pledging activities  general market interest rates and unforeseen market conditions 
westfield bank s financial condition is affected by its ability to borrow at attractive rates  retain deposits at market rates and other market conditions 
management considers westfield bank s sources of liquidity to be adequate to meet expected funding needs and also to be responsive to changing interest rate markets net interest and dividend income simulation 
we use a simulation model to monitor interest rate risk 
this model reports the net interest income at risk primarily under seven different interest rate environments 
specifically  net interest income is measured in one scenario that assumes no change in interest rates  and six scenarios where interest rates increase  and and decrease  and basis points  respectively  from current rates over the one year time period following the current consolidated financial statements 
the changes in interest income and interest expense due to changes in interest rates reflect the rate sensitivity of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
for example  in a rising interest rate environment  the interest income from an adjustable rate loan is likely to increase depending on its repricing characteristics while the interest income from a fixed rate loan would not increase until the funds were repaid and loaned out at a higher interest rate 
the tables below set forth as of december  the estimated changes in net interest and dividend income that would result from incremental changes in interest rates over the applicable twelve month period 
for the twelve months ending december  dollars in thousands changes in net interest interest rates basis and dividend points income change  market rates were assumed to increase  and basis points and decrease  and basis points  in even increments over the twelve month period 
the repricing and or new rates of assets and liabilities moved in tandem with market rates 
however  in certain deposit products  the use of data from a historical analysis indicated that the rates on these products would move only a fraction of the rate change amount 
management believes that a percentage of the growth in core deposits over the last three years was due to the low rate environment  ie no incentive for customers to lock up funds in time deposits 
management believes that in a rising rate environment  westfield bank will experience a shift  by some customers  out of core deposits and back into term deposits 
based upon analysis  management has estimated what is believed to be the rate sensitive portion of the funds currently in core deposits 
in scenarios that assume a rising rate environment of basis points or more  this shift is incorporated into the balance sheet forecasts 
we have developed consolidated balance sheet growth projections for the twelve month period 
the same product mix and growth strategy was used for all rate change simulations  except for the shift into term deposits in certain scenarios as described in the previous paragraph 
income from tax exempt assets is calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
pertinent data from each loan account  deposit account and investment security was used to calculate future cash flows 
the data included such items as maturity date  payment amount  next repricing date  repricing frequency  repricing index and spread 
prepayment speed assumptions were based upon the difference between the account rate and the current market rate 
the income simulation analysis was based upon a variety of assumptions 
these assumptions include but are not limited to balance sheet growth  asset mix  prepayment speeds  the timing and level of interest rates  and the shape of the yield curve 
as market conditions vary from the assumptions in the income simulation analysis  actual results will differ 
as a result  the income simulation analysis does not serve as a forecast of net interest income  nor do the calculations represent any actions that management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
recent accounting pronouncements on january  westfield financial adopted sfas r  share based payment sfas r or the statement  which requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
the effect of sfas r is that entities are required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock options based on the grant date fair value of the award  and to recognize the cost over the period the employee is required to provide services for the award 
sfas r permits entities to use any option pricing model that meets the fair value objective in the statement 
westfield financial uses the binomial model for its adoption of the statement 
westfield financial adopted sfas r on january  using the modified prospective method 
under this method  awards that are granted  modified  or settled after december   are measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas r 
also under this method  expense is recognized for awards that were granted prior to january  but vest after january   based on the fair value determined at the grant date under sfas  accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  westfield financial accounted for stock compensation under the intrinsic value method permitted by accounting principles board opinion no

 accounting for servicing of financial assets  which amends fasb statement no 
this statement requires that all separately recognized servicing rights be initially measured at fair value  if practicable 
for each class of separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities  this statement permits an entity to choose either of the following subsequent measurement methods amortize servicing assets or liabilities in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income or net servicing loss  or report servicing assets or liabilities at fair value at each reporting date and report changes in fair value in earnings in the period in which the changes occur the fair value method 
this statement also requires additional disclosures for all separately recognized servicing rights and is effective for new transactions occurring and for subsequent measurement at the beginning of westfield financial s calendar year 
as management does not plan to adopt the fair value method of accounting for its servicing rights  this statement is not expected to have a material impact on westfield financial s consolidated financial statements

  and r 
this statement improves financial reporting by requiring employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income or a business entity or changes in unrestricted net assets of a not for profit organization

in september  the fasb ratified eitf  accounting for deferred compensation and postretirement benefit aspects of endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangements 
this issue addresses accounting for split dollar life insurance arrangements whereby the employer purchases a policy to insure the life of an employee  and separately enters into an agreement to split the policy benefits between the employer and the employee 
this eitf states that an obligation arises as a result of a substantive agreement with an employee to provide future postretirement benefits 
under eitf  the obligation is not settled upon entering into an insurance arrangement 
since the obligation is not settled  a liability should be recognized in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  westfield financial is in the process of evaluating the potential impacts of adopting eitf on its consolidated financial statements 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab no 
provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a potential current year misstatement 
prior to sab  companies might evaluate the materiality of financial statement misstatements using either the income statement or balance approach  with the income statement approach focusing on new misstatements added in the current year  and the balance sheet approach focusing on the cumulative amount of misstatement present in a company s balance sheet 
misstatements that would be material under one approach could be viewed as immaterial under another approach  and not be corrected 
sab now requires that companies view financial statement misstatements as material if they are material according to either the income statement or balance sheet approach 
sab is applicable to all financial statements issued by westfield financial for the year ended december  in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
this statement provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the standard s objective is to reduce both the complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
sfas also established presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year beginning after november  early adoption is permitted if the company makes the choice in the first days of that fiscal year and also elects to apply the provisions of sfas westfield financial does not expect sfas to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of westfield financial have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
gaap generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of westfield financial s operations 
unlike industrial companies  westfield financial s assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation
