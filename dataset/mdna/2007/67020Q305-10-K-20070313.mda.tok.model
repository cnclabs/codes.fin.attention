you should read the following discussion of our financial condition in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
for additional information regarding some of these risks and uncertainties that affect our business and the industry in which we operate  please see risk factors and forward looking statements elsewhere in this report 
overview for purposes of this discussion relative to the financial and operational results and cash flows for the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december   we have combined the financial and operational results and cash flows for the period january  to may  of ntelos inc with our financial and operational results and cash flows for the period may  to december  we had no operating activities prior to the completion of our acquisition of ntelos inc on may  we believe this comparison provides the most practical way to comment on the results of operations and cash flows 
we are a leading provider of wireless and wireline communications services to consumers and businesses primarily in virginia and west virginia under the ntelos brand name 
our wireless operations are composed of an ntelos branded retail business and a wholesale business that we operate under an exclusive contract with sprint spectrum lp we believe our regional focus and contiguous service area provide us with a differentiated competitive position relative to our primary wireless competitors  all of whom are national providers 
our wireless revenues have experienced a compound annual growth rate from to and accounted for of our total revenues in we hold digital pcs licenses to operate in basic trading areas with a licensed population of approximately million  and we have deployed a network using code division multiple access technology  or cdma  in basic trading areas which currently covers a total population of approximately million potential subscribers 
as of december   our wireless retail business had approximately  ntelos branded subscribers  representing a penetration of our total covered population 

table of contents we made significant investments in our network in and  adding new wireless cell sites  including new wireless cell sites placed in service in the fourth quarter of  and increasing our total cell sites to at the end of these investments and other initiatives  including the introduction of national rate plans and enhanced data service offerings  contributed to a increase in subscribers  a increase in arpu  and an reduction in churn during we also have an agreement with sprint spectrum lp to act as their exclusive wholesale provider of network services through july  under this arrangement  which we refer to as the strategic network alliance  we are the exclusive pcs network service provider for all sprint nextel wireless customers in our western virginia and west virginia service area 
for the year ended december   we realized wholesale revenues of million  primarily related to the strategic network alliance  representing an increase of over the same period in founded in  our wireline incumbent local exchange carrier business is conducted through two subsidiaries that qualify as rural telephone companies  or rlecs  under the telecommunications act 
these two rlecs provide wireline communications services to residential and business customers in the western virginia communities of waynesboro  covington  clifton forge and portions of botetourt and augusta counties 
as of december   we operated  rlec telephone access lines 
we also own a  mile regional fiber optic network which directly connects our networks with many of the largest markets in the mid atlantic region 
we leverage our wireline network infrastructure to offer competitive voice and data communication services in virginia and west virginia outside our rlec coverage area 
within our competitive segment  we market and sell local and long distance  voice and data services almost exclusively to business customers through our competitive local exchange carrier  or clec  and internet service provider  or isp  operation 
as of december   we served customers with  clec access line connections 
we also offer dsl services in of our rlec service area and as of december  we operated  broadband access connections in our markets  representing an increase of in in and  our wireline operating income margins were and  respectively 
we were formed in january by the cvc entities and the quadrangle entities for the purpose of acquiring ntelos inc on january   we entered into a transaction agreement with ntelos inc and certain of its shareholders to acquire ntelos inc in accordance with this agreement  we acquired of the ntelos inc common stock and stock warrants on february  we completed our acquisition of all of ntelos inc s remaining common stock  warrants and vested options by means of a cash merger on may  in connection with our acquisition of ntelos inc  we assumed approximately million in debt including million of the ntelos inc senior secured credit facilities and million of capital lease obligations 
following the merger transaction  ntelos inc became our wholly owned subsidiary 
accordingly  we began consolidating the results of ntelos inc into our financial statements on may  during the first quarter of  we completed an initial public offering the ipo of  shares of our common stock at an offering price of per share 
the offering consisted of  shares of common stock sold on february  and  shares of common stock sold on march  pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
we received proceeds from the offering of approximately million  net of million in underwriting fees 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds to terminate our advisory agreements with cvc and quadrangle and million to redeem our floating rate senior notes in full including unpaid accrued interest of million on april  the remaining proceeds  combined with available cash  were used to pay a million dividend on our  shares of class b common stock on june  the payment of the dividend represented the payment in full of the million class b distribution preference provided for in our restated certificate of incorporation 
subsequent to this distribution  all of the  shares of the class b common stock were converted into shares of common stock  increasing the shares of common stock outstanding to approximately  at december   inclusive of approximately  shares of common stock issued from the exercise of stock options during the period and approximately  shares of common stock issued through the employee stock purchase plan 

table of contents effects of being a public company upon completion of the initial public offering  we became subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and the other rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission  or sec 
we also are subject to various other regulatory requirements  including the sarbanes oxley act of sox 
in addition  we are subject to the rules of the nasdaq global market 
we are working with our independent legal  accounting and financial advisors to identify those areas in which changes should be made to our financial and management control systems to manage our growth and our obligations as a public company 
these areas include corporate governance  corporate control  internal audit  disclosure controls and procedures and financial reporting and accounting systems 
we have made  and will continue to make  changes in these and other areas  including our internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  compliance with reporting and other requirements applicable to public companies creates additional costs for us and will require the time and attention of management 
we incurred approximately million of incremental operating expenses in  our first year of being a public company 
the majority of these costs are associated with increased director and officer insurance costs and external consulting fees incurred to prepare for sarbanes oxley act compliance 
we are required to be in compliance by december  accordingly  we anticipate that we will incur additional incremental costs next year 
at this time  we project that the total incremental operating expenses of being a public company will be approximately million in the incremental costs are estimates  and actual incremental expenses could be materially different from these estimates 
other overview discussion to supplement our financial statements presented under generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  throughout this document we reference non gaap measures  such as average monthly revenues per handset unit in service  or arpu  to measure operating performance for which our operating managers are responsible and upon which we evaluate their performance 

table of contents arpu is a telecommunications industry metric that measures service revenues per period divided by the weighted average number of handsets in service during that period 
arpu as defined below may not be similar to arpu measures of other companies  is not a measurement under gaap and should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  the information contained in our consolidated statements of operations 
we closely monitor the effects of new rate plans and service offerings on arpu in order to determine their effectiveness 
we believe arpu provides management useful information concerning the appeal of our rate plans and service offerings and our performance in attracting and retaining high value customers 
the table below provides a reconciliation of subscriber revenues used to calculate arpu to wireless communications revenues shown in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and year ended december  dollars in thousands  other than arpu data wireless communications revenues less equipment revenues from sales to new customers less equipment revenues from sales to existing customers less wholesale revenues plus less other revenues and adjustments wireless gross subscriber revenues less paid in advance and prepay subscriber revenues less plus adjustments wireless gross postpay subscriber revenues average subscribers arpu average postpay subscribers postpay arpu wireless gross subscriber revenues less wireless voice and other features revenues wireless data revenues average subscribers total data arpu operating revenues our revenues are generated from the following categories wireless pcs  consisting of retail revenues from network access  data services  equipment revenues and feature services  and wholesale revenues from the strategic network alliance and roaming from other carriers  wireline communications  including rlec service revenues and competitive service revenues  including revenues from our key strategic products local  broadband voice and data services  and high capacity network access and transport services  long distance and dial up internet services  and other communications services revenues  including primarily revenues from paging and revenue from leasing excess building space 

table of contents operating expenses our operating expenses are incurred from the following categories cost of wireless sales  including digital pcs handset equipment costs which  in keeping with industry practice  we sell to our customers at a price below our cost  and usage based access charges  including long distance  roaming charges  and other direct costs incurred in accessing other telecommunications providers networks in order to provide wireless services to our end use customers  maintenance and support expenses  including costs related to specific property  plant and equipment  as well as indirect costs such as engineering and general administration of property  plant and equipment  leased facility expenses for connection to other carriers  cell sites and switch locations  customer operations expenses  including marketing  product management  product advertising  selling  billing  publication of regional telephone directories  customer care  directory services and bad debt expenses  corporate operations expenses  including taxes other than income  executive  accounting  legal  purchasing  information technology  human resources and other general and administrative expenses  including non cash compensation expense related to the original class a common stock and option instruments held by certain members of corporate management  depreciation and amortization  including depreciable long lived property  plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets where applicable  accretion of asset retirement obligations  or aro  capital restructuring charges associated with our acquisition of ntelos inc  and termination of advisory agreements 
other income expenses our other income expenses are generated incurred from interest expense on debt instruments  including changes in fair value of our interest rate swap instrument  our equity share of the net loss of ntelos inc from our investment in ntelos inc 
for the period february  through may   other income  which includes interest income and gain on sale of investment 
income taxes our income tax liability or benefit and effective tax rate increases or decreases based upon changes in a number of factors  including our pre tax income or loss  net operating losses and related carryforwards  valuation allowances  alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards  state minimum tax assessments  gain or loss on the sale of assets and investments  write down of assets and investments  non deductible expenses and other tax deductible amounts 
minority interests in losses earnings of subsidiaries our minority interest relates to a rlec segment investment in a partnership that owns certain signaling equipment and provides service to a number of small rlecs and to verisign 
we also have a majority interest in the virginia pcs alliance lc  or the va alliance  that provides pcs services to a million populated area in central and western virginia 
the va alliance has incurred significant cumulative operating losses since it initiated pcs services in we recognize a minority interest credit adjustment only to the extent of capital contributions from the minority owners 
no such contributions were made during the year ended december   and amounts related to the rlec segment minority interest were not material for all periods presented 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  overview operating revenues increased million  or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  wireless pcs accounted for of this increase  with growth occurring from both subscriber revenues and wholesale revenues 
wireline contributed the remaining revenue increase primarily from minute driven increases in access revenues and increases in key strategic products from the competitive segment  partially offset by declines in revenues of other competitive segment products 
operating income increased million over the comparative years  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  net income decreased million from net income of million for the year ended december  to a net loss of million for the year ended december  included in the net loss for the year ended december  was a charge of million for the termination of advisory agreements and an increase in interest expense of million  primarily due to transaction related charges of million  million of interest on our floating rate notes  which were paid off in april  and significantly lower interest during prior to the refinancing and merger transactions in late february included in net income for the period ended december  was a gain on the interest rate swap instrument of million 
in addition  non cash compensation charges were million in and million in finally  income tax expense was million and million for the year ended december  and december   respectively 
operating revenues the following tables identify our operating revenues on a business segment basis for the years ended december  and december   inclusive of ntelos inc s revenues on a business segment basis for the period january  through may  year ended december  operating revenues dollars in thousands variance variance wireless pcs wireline rlec competitive wireline total wireline other total wireless communications revenues wireless communications revenues increased million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  due to an increase in our ntelos branded net subscriber revenue of million  or  a million  or  increase in wholesale and roaming revenues  and a million  or  increase in equipment sales revenues 
subscriber revenues reflected subscriber growth of over the comparative years  or  subscribers  from  subscribers as of december  to  subscribers as of december  as of december   postpay subscribers represented of total subscribers  a decline of from as of december  
table of contents for the comparative years  subscriber revenues reflected the subscriber growth described above and an increase in arpu of  from to for the year ended december  and december   respectively 
the increase in arpu was driven in part by increased data revenue per subscriber which increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  additionally  arpu increased due to the continued increase in higher service rate plans including the national plans 
other subscriber revenue increased related in large part to growth in data services including data bundle packages introduced during the second quarter of gross subscriber additions were higher for  at  than gross subscriber additions of  this increase in gross adds combined with the introduction of more feature rich handsets sold in the period as compared to the period led to an increase in equipment sales revenue of million  or  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  total subscriber churn decreased  from for  subscribers to for  subscribers  due to year over year improvement in both postpay and prepay churn due primarily to an increased take rate of the national plans and other program improvements in the increase in wholesale revenues for the comparative periods was driven by increased voice and data usage under the strategic network alliance 
wholesale revenues grew  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  pricing reductions went into effect on july  and july  relating to travel minutes of use minutes from sprint nextel customers from outside our region and july  relating to data usage in accordance with the annual pricing reset provisions of this wholesale agreement 
similar to this past year  the impact of the july pricing reductions was more than offset by increased usage 
our wholesale revenues are derived primarily from the voice usage or home minutes of use by sprint nextel customers who live in the strategic network alliance service area  those customers of sprint nextel who use our voice services travel minutes of use while traveling through the strategic network alliance service area and data usage by sprint nextel customers who live in or travel through the strategic network alliance service area 
in addition to volume increases experienced on existing cell sites  we have added cell sites within this wholesale service area since december during the fourth quarter of  improving existing service and extending this coverage area 
based on notification from sprint nextel of its retail yield for voice usage and data usage for  pursuant to the terms of our strategic network agreement  further pricing reductions are expected to go into effect on july  relating to travel minutes of use and  for the first time since entering into the contract in  for home minutes of use 
sprint nextel s proposed data revenue yield is significantly lower than the comparable rate for the prior year 
we have experienced significant growth in data usage in and expect continued growth in our discussions with sprint nextel as to the appropriate voice and data rates to commence on july  continue at this time 
we expect continued growth in voice and data usage which should result in continued growth in wholesale revenue for compared to we entered into a seven year exclusive wholesale agreement with sprint spectrum lp in while the merger of sprint and nextel has not had a negative impact on us to date  the ultimate impact of this merger is not known at this time 
further  sprint nextel acquired controlling ownership interest in nextel partners inc  a wireless affiliate of sprint nextel  in and the potential impact of any such consolidation is unknown 
see risk factors contained in item a 
of this annual report on form k for the year ended december  wireline communications revenues wireline communications revenues increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  rlec revenues 
rlec revenues  which include local service  access and toll service  directory advertising and calling feature revenues from our rlec customers increased over the comparative years despite a access line decrease  with lines totaling  as of december  compared to  as of december  revenues for the comparative years increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the 
table of contents year ended december  this increase was due primarily to an increase in access revenues of million  or  over the respective periods driven by an increase in carrier access minutes of from to due primarily to growth in usage by wireless carriers  coupled with a million lump sum cash receipt in september from the universal service administrative company usac pursuant to an fcc order related to our safety net support dispute for the period january through september our interstate access rates will be subject to a biennial reset reduction on july  the access line loss noted above is reflective primarily of a reduction in centrex lines  a loss of second lines due to migration away from dial up internet access  wireless substitution and the loss of pri lines serving our own and other isp operations within the rlec service area 
these line losses  to date  do not reflect the introduction of competitive voice service offerings  such as from cable companies or clecs  in our markets 
while still uncertain  we do anticipate cable competition from comcast to commence in we have estimated that our access line losses may be between and in  assuming cable competition does occur which would impact rlec revenues  principally from residential consumers 
competitive wireline revenues 
competitive wireline total operating revenues  including revenues from local and long distance  voice and data  internet access and network access and transport services increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  revenues from our key strategic products in the competitive wireline segment grew million  or  over the comparative years  offset by declines in other competitive revenues 
local access and pri revenues increased million  or  due to an increase in pri and local access lines of  from  lines as of december  to  lines as of december   partially offset by increased sales of business advantage bundle packages and longer term contracts which are sold at prices below our current overall blended average 
revenue from broadband and integrated access services increased million  or  from to due primarily to customer growth of with the broadband products 
revenue from private line  cap and transport increased million  or  over the comparative years from new circuit additions with carriers 
long distance revenue increased million  or  from to customers due to an increase in customers of over the comparable periods  from  as of december  to  as of december   partially offset by a decrease in arpu 
offsetting this were declines in internet  switched access and reciprocal compensation revenues 
dial up revenue declined million from continued customer erosion  with  fewer customers  or  from  at december  to  at december  in addition  switched access and reciprocal compensation revenues declined million due to rate and volume reductions  offset by an increase in wireless transport revenues of million 
other communications services revenues other communications services revenue decreased million due to continued decline in our paging business  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  
table of contents operating expenses the following tables identify our operating expenses on a business segment basis  consistent with the tables presenting operating revenues above  for the years ended december  and december   inclusive of ntelos inc s operating expenses on a business segment basis for the period january  through may  year ended december  operating expenses dollars in thousands variance variance wireless pcs wireline rlec competitive wireline total wireline other operating expenses  before depreciation and amortization  gain on sale of assets  accretion of asset retirement obligations  termination of advisory agreements  non cash compensation and capital restructuring charges depreciation and amortization gain on sale of assets   n m accretion of asset retirement obligations termination of advisory agreements non cash compensation capital restructuring charges   n m total operating expenses the following describes our operating expenses on an aggregate basis and on a basis consistent with our financial statement presentation

increased cost of sales  particularly roaming costs  handsets  handset insurance and features  accounted for million of the increase 
excluding cost of sales  the remaining increase of million  or  over the comparative years was primarily due to increased retention costs of the larger subscriber base  an increase in agent commissions due to increased sales and an increase in cell site expense related to a increase in the number of cell sites and the increased subscriber base 
these increases were offset by improvement in bad debt expense of million  or  over the comparative years due to improved collections experience 
wireline operating expenses before depreciation and amortization  accretion of asset retirement obligations  termination of advisory agreements  non cash compensation charges and capital restructuring charges increased 
table of contents million  or  over the comparative years 
this increase was largely related to increased access expense  repairs and maintenance expense  long distance wholesale expense  sales commissions and increased salary  wage and benefit expense due primarily to increased average headcount year over year 
other operating expenses  before depreciation and amortization  accretion of asset retirement obligations  termination of advisory agreements  non cash compensation and capital restructuring charges from the other communication service businesses decreased million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  due primarily to a decrease of million in advisory fees 
these costs were eliminated during the first quarter of as a result of the termination of our advisory agreement with cvc management llc and quadrangle advisors llc the advisors in february absent the decrease in advisory fees  these operating expenses increased million over the comparative years 
this increase was primarily due to increased unallocated corporate costs associated with the company becoming a publicly traded company in cost of wireless sales cost of wireless sales increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  equipment cost of sales  or cos  increased million in compared to primarily due to  more wireless gross customer additions over the comparative years and sales of feature rich  more expensive handsets 
roaming costs related to increased sales for national plans and other plans which contain more package roaming minutes increased million over the twelve month comparative periods 
subscribers with a national plan represented and of the subscriber base at december  and  respectively 
the company expects continued growth in roaming costs from sales of national plans which commenced in late september other feature cost of sales increased million in compared to  driven primarily by a million increase in the cost of handset insurance and a million increase in the cost of advanced data features and the related take rates 
these increases were primarily offset by a million decrease in toll cost of sales for compared to due to long distance rate reductions partially offset by higher usage 
maintenance and support expenses maintenance and support expenses increased million  or  from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cell site costs for wireless increased million over the comparative years as a result of the larger subscriber base and a increase in cell sites placed in service between december  and december  in connection with planned network expansion and enhancements  we are planning an additional to increase in the number of cell sites in accordingly  when these and future cell sites are placed in service  we expect these costs to increase 
the increase in maintenance and support is also attributable to transport and access expense which increased million over the comparative years due to the wireless pcs growth and growth of the strategic wireline competitive services and clec access line charge increases 
repairs and maintenance expense increased million from to due to new equipment maintenance contracts and required maintenance on existing routes 
long distance wholesale expense increased million due to long distance subscriber growth of 
in addition to these increases  we recorded million of non cash compensation charges during and million during related to the original class a common stock and option instruments held by certain members of operations and engineering management 
the remaining increase is primarily attributable to increased compensation expenses related to an increased workforce year over year 
customer operations expenses customer operations expenses increased million  or  from million for to million for during the years ended december  and  we recorded million and million of non cash compensation charges  respectively  related to the original class a common stock and option instruments held by certain members of sales  marketing and customer care executive management 
the remainder of the increase is primarily related to the direct costs associated with an increased wireless pcs customer base and the rapidly changing competitive environment in wireless during the comparative periods  including a million increase in customer retention costs and a million increase in employee and agent sales commissions and other selling expenses due to volume and incentives 
compensation 
table of contents and other customer operation expenses increased million  or  over the comparative periods related primarily to the growth in wireless subscribers 
these increases were primarily offset by an improvement in bad debt expense of million over the comparative years 
corporate operations expenses for the comparative periods  corporate operations expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase primarily relates to an increase of million of non cash compensation charges and a million increase in certain insurance expenses and wireless regulatory fees 
these increases were primarily offset by a decrease in advisory fee charges of million  a million decrease in compensation related expenses due primarily to lower bonus and medical claims expenses and a million decrease related to favorable settlements of operating tax matters and favorable developments resulting in reductions to other operating tax reserve 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as of the may  merger date  the company revalued its long lived assets 
as a result  depreciable fixed assets decreased million and other intangibles increased million 
the increase in other intangibles resulted in a monthly increase in amortization expense of approximately million for the periods after may  as compared to amortization of other intangibles for the period ended may  and before  and it accounts for million of the total increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the comparative years 
depreciation expense related to fixed asset additions was more than offset by assets that became fully depreciated during a period subsequent to december  and by accelerated depreciation related to the g xrtt network upgrade which commenced in and was completed during the second quarter of gain on sale of assets for the year ended december   we recognized a gain of approximately million on the sale of certain inactive pcs licenses covering populations in pennsylvania 
accretion of asset retirement obligations accretion of asset retirement obligations is recorded in order to accrete the estimated asset retirement obligation over the life of the related asset up to its future expected settlement cost 
this charge increased million over the comparative years  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  capital restructuring charges capital restructuring charges of million were recorded in for legal  financial and consulting costs  accelerated payment of certain retirement obligations and employee retention related costs  all of which are directly attributable to the refinancing merger transactions  the initial closing of which occurred on february  with ntelos inc borrowing million from the new million senior secured credit facilities and using these proceeds to refinance substantially all of its existing indebtedness and repurchase  pursuant to a tender offer for million  or approximately of its existing common stock  warrants and options 
on may   we acquired all of ntelos inc s remaining common shares  warrants and options by means of a merger 
termination of advisory agreement the company through ntelos inc entered into advisory agreements with the advisors  whereby the advisors would provide advisory and other services to the company for a period of ten years for a combined annual advisory fee of million payable quarterly at the beginning of each quarter 
under certain conditions set forth in these agreements  the company could terminate these agreements prior to expiration 
on february   commensurate with its ipo  the company terminated the advisory agreements  paying a million termination fee on that date 
other income expenses interest expense on debt instruments for the comparative years increased million  or  from million to million due primarily to the low interest expense during the period prior to the 
table of contents merger and refinancing transactions in february when the company added million of debt 
interest during this period was approximately million lower than it would have been if the transactions had occurred on january  in the second quarter of  we incurred million and million of interest charges related to the write off of the high yield floating rate notes deferred issuance costs and discount  respectively  when the notes were repaid 
additionally  we incurred a million prepayment penalty recorded as an interest charge related to the second lien term loan repayment 
we also incurred interest on the high yield floating rate notes  which were originally issued during the fourth quarter of and repaid on april   of million in million of interest was recognized in the fourth quarter of prior to the repayment 
this increase was offset by decreased interest rates associated with the debt refinancing in june where the million second lien credit facility which bore interest at above the eurodollar rate was refinanced with a new first lien credit facility bearing interest at above the eurodollar rate 
the blended rate improvement realized from this refinancing is approximately  or a million annual savings at the current level of senior debt 
the change in fair value of interest rate swap instrument was a loss of million for the year ended december  compared with a gain of million for the year ended december  our swap agreement  entered into in connection with the february  financing transactions  was not designated as an interest rate hedge instrument for accounting purposes and therefore the changes in the fair value of the swap agreement are recorded as a charge or credit to loss gain on interest rate swap 
for the period january  through february   we had a swap agreement with a notional amount of million  million less than our current swap agreement 
the fair value of the current interest rate swap agreement at december  has been recorded as deferred asset interest rate swap of million 
the interest rate swap agreement matures in february other income primarily relates to interest income from cash and cash equivalents 
other income totaled million for the year ended december   million higher than the prior year due to an increase in cash  due primarily to cash proceeds from the ipo and cash generated from operations in we also realized interest rate improvements between the comparable periods 
we recorded gains on sale of investments totaling million for the year ended december  related to the redemption of the rtb stock for which we received the cash in april see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii
