comparison of with net sales net sales for the year ended december  decreased 
million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  the slight decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to an reduction in our fleet sales 
an industry wide reduction in truck purchases contributed to lower fleet sales but this was offset by increases in our core dry freight product line and our startrans bus division which increased and  respectively 
we partially attribute the increased retail demand of our dry freight product line to customers buying chassis to avoid the higher cost of chassis 
new  more stringent diesel engine emission standards became effective for engines produced beginning january  though difficult to predict with certainty  we believe this revenue acceleration which benefited could  and most likely will have an adverse impact on our retail dry freight truck product line and possibly other products in however  because of our broad and diverse product line  we are hopeful of mitigating the effect on second half revenues 
the increased startrans bus division revenues were the result of a strong demand for mid size buses and a new cycle of transit authority purchasing 
our total sales backlog was million at december  compared to million at december  on february   we acquired the business operations and assets of pony xpress  inc pony xpress  a manufacturer of highly specialized vehicles 
though a relatively small acquisition  it provides us with the platform for our newly formed silver crown operations 
silver crown has unique manufacturing expertise that will enable our entry into additional highly specialized vehicle markets including homeland security

is primarily due to our growing startrans bus division and our newly acquired silver crown division  which have a higher material content and accounted for a larger portion of our total sales volume in additionally  the company experienced escalating steel and aluminum raw material costs throughout but was able to offset most of these increases with price increases on a majority of its truck division products effective in late april and august of we continue to closely monitor and manage our major commodity costs through close communication and negotiation with key suppliers  utilizing cost monitoring tools and developing strategies to mitigate cost and availability issues 
the company also continually strives to reduce the cost of its product offerings through the development and use of innovative materials  robotics and improved processes 
historically  the company has experienced and recorded both favorable and unfavorable physical inventory adjustments 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  the company recorded a million favorable inventory adjustment compared to a million unfavorable adjustment recorded in the third quarter of fiscal year due to our product diversity  complexity  customization and on line engineering  inventory relief using standard bills of material does not provide full relief of our inventory 
therefore  the company records an additional cost relief adjustment based on various factors 
beginning in late and throughout  the company intensified its bills of material accuracy initiatives and cost relief systems and methods in conjunction with performing additional interim physical inventories and recording any adjustments relating thereto 
in  the company improved its bills of materials accuracy without changing its cost relief adjustment to account for these improvements  resulting in the favorable inventory adjustment 
the more frequent physical inventories and the continued improvements from the process improvement initiatives should enable the company to continue to reduce the magnitude of physical inventory adjustments 
direct labor direct labor as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in the direct labor percentage increase was the result of a delay in oem supplied chassis in the first quarter that caused the company to temporarily shut down production lines  thereby negatively affecting labor and overhead absorption

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in management s opinion  the company s critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  excess and obsolete inventories  inventory relief  accrued insurance and accrued warranty 
revenue recognition the company generally recognizes revenue when the unit is shipped to the customer 
revenue on certain customer requested bill and hold transactions is recognized subsequent to when the customer is notified that the product s have been completed according to customer specifications  have passed all of the company s quality control inspections  and are ready for delivery based on established delivery terms 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would affect our future operating results 
excess and obsolete inventories the company must make estimates regarding the future use of raw materials and finished products and provides a provision for obsolete or slow moving inventories 
if actual product life cycles  product demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required which would affect future operating results 
inventory relief for monthly and quarterly financial reporting  cost of sales is recorded and inventories are relieved by the use of gross profit percentage method  standard bills of material  adjusted for scrap and other estimated factors affecting inventory relief 
because of the customized nature of the company s products  it is difficult to place full reliance on the bills of material for accurate relief of inventories 
although the company continues to refine the process of creating accurate bills of materials  manual adjustments  which are based on estimates  are necessary in an effort to assure correct relief of inventories for products sold 
the estimate calculations consider the customized nature of products  historical inventory relief percentages  scrap variances and other factors which could impact inventory relief 
the accuracy of the inventory relief is not known until interim and or annual physical inventories are conducted at each of the company s plant locations 
during  the company s annual physical inventories resulted in a net unfavorable adjustment of million which was recorded in the third quarter of subsequent to the third quarter adverse inventory adjustments  management dedicated significant in house resources to refining bills of materials  improving cost accounting functions and instituting new inventory policies and procedures 
in addition  management implemented more frequent physical inventories at certain locations 
the third quarter of was favorably impacted by million of inventory adjustments resulting from physical inventories 
these inventories were conducted during june  july and august at all the company s plant locations  with most of the adjustment attributable to inventory quantity adjustments 
because the company does not have perpetual inventory systems to track inventory quantities for raw materials and work in progress and it is not always practical or cost beneficial to cease production to conduct physical inventories  the company has continued to be dependent on physical inventory procedures and such favorable or unfavorable adjustments are historically material to the quarterly period in which such adjustments are recorded 
further  it is not possible to determine the impact of physical inventory adjustments on prior interim periods  since data on interim inventory quantities is not available 
accrued insurance the company has a self insured retention against product liability claims with insurance coverage over and above the retention 
the company is also self insured for a portion of its employee medical benefits and workers compensation 
product liability claims are routinely reviewed by the company s insurance carrier and management routinely reviews other self insurance risks for purposes of establishing ultimate loss estimates 
in addition  management must determine estimated liability for claims incurred but not reported 
such estimates and any subsequent changes in estimates may result in adjustments to our operating results in the future 
effective january   the company began utilizing its newly formed and wholly owned small captive insurance company to insure certain of its business risks 
certain risks  previously self insured by the company and its subsidiaries  are now insured by the captive insurance subsidiary 
in addition  certain business risks not previously insured are now insured by the captive insurance subsidiary 
since the captive insurance company has not reinsured any of its coverages  the company s overall self insurance risk has not changed 
the captive insurance subsidiary is expected to help the company manage its risk exposures and under the internal revenue code the net underwriting income of a small captive  as defined  is not taxable 
accrued warranty the company provides limited warranties for periods of up to five years from the date of retail sale 
estimated warranty costs are provided at the time of sale and are based upon historical experience

such forward looking statements are based on assumptions made by  and information currently available to  management 
although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  and it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such expectations include  without limitation  limitations on the availability of chassis on which the company s product is dependent  availability of raw materials  raw material cost increases and severe interest rate increases 
furthermore  the company can provide no assurance that such raw material cost increases can be passed on to its customers through implementation of price increases for the company s products

the company assumes no obligation to update the forward looking statements or to update the reasons actual results could differ from those contemplated by such forward looking statements 
control risks while the company believes its control systems are effective  there are inherent limitations in all control systems  and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
the company continues to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls  disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
in addition  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within the company have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
further  controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more persons  or by management override of the controls 
the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
over time  a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
because of inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  operations of the company are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
these fluctuations can vary the cost of investing  financing and operating 
the company s primary risk exposure results from changes in short term interest rates 
in an effort to manage risk exposures  the company strives to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions 
the company s revolving line of credit is floating rate debt and bears interest at the bank s prime rate or libor plus certain basis points depending on the pricing option selected and the company s leverage ratio 
at december   the company was party to an interest rate swap agreement dated july  the interest rate swap agreement is a contract to exchange floating rate for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the interest rate swap agreement and is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the amount of exposure of credit loss 
the differential paid or received under the interest rate swap agreement is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
the following is a summary of the interest rate swap agreement outstanding at december  notional amount fixed rate maturity july  based on the company s overall interest rate exposure at december   a hypothetical percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the financial instruments as of december   would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values of interest rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period
