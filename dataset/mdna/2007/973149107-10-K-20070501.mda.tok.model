key operating and financial metrics members of our senior management team regularly review key operating and financial metrics such as net revenues  earnings per share  operating cash flows and net change in deferred revenues 
these metrics allow management to monitor the robustness and profitability of our business and to evaluate any necessary areas for investment or  in contrast  for improved efficiencies and effectiveness 
how we earn our revenues we earn our revenues from the license and sale of our products and from providing services related to our products 
our software products are licensed to our customers for their development use under either a subscription license or a perpetual license 
customers who purchase a subscription license  also referred to as an enterprise license  are charged per term  typically  an annual fee  renewable at the election of the customer 
customers who purchase a perpetual license are generally charged a one time  up front fee 
once development is completed  whether under a subscription license or a perpetual license  we also generally charge our customers a production license fee for every copy of our product included in the final  manufactured device 
customers either report their usage on a quarterly basis or purchase a block of production licenses in advance of use 
we also earn revenue for support and maintenance services for our products  which includes telephone support and provision of updates 
for products licensed under a perpetual license  support and maintenance may be purchased for a separate fee 
for products licensed under a subscription license  support and maintenance is included in the per term fee  and includes upgrades 
in addition  we also charge customers for other services related to our products  such as training and professional services 
our training services are generally purchased for a fixed fee  while our professional services are available on both a time and materials and fixed price contract basis 
our professional services are designed to assist our customers with the design and development of a completed device or application 
our product revenues are comprised of revenues from perpetual licenses  the revenues that we receive for all production licenses  whether related to development under a perpetual license or a subscription license  and hardware revenues 
our subscription revenues are derived from revenues from our subscription licenses  not related to production fees  and includes support and maintenance provided to these customers 
our services revenues are derived from our professional services revenues and training  as well as revenues for support and maintenance of our products under perpetual licenses

table of contents our licensing models we license our software using two primary licensing models  subscription based enterprise licensing and project based perpetual licensing 
our wind river platforms and workbench integrated development suite are primarily licensed under enterprise licensing 
our subscription based enterprise license model has been offered to customers since november this model includes subscription based development licenses that are typically one year in duration  although some licenses extend to periods greater than one year 
subscription based enterprise licenses eliminate the more traditional project and site restrictions on the use of our products 
at the end of the subscription period  the customer s right to develop using wind river platforms or tools expires unless renewed 
most subscription based enterprise licenses i have an initial duration of one year  with optional annual renewals  ii include payment terms for the full cost of the annual subscription within days after entering into the enterprise license agreement and iii include production license reporting once a customer makes a commercial release of a device that incorporates our products 
during fiscal  and  some customers entered into multi year license agreements with us 
these agreements generally included payment terms for the full cost of the multi year subscription within days after entering into the enterprise licensing agreement 
we also license our software under project based perpetual licenses 
under this model  our customers pay an up front  development license fee together with an annual maintenance fee that is based on a fixed percentage of the total licensing fees 
for device software products  the customer typically also pays an additional per unit  per project production license fee based on the number of copies of our operating system software that are included in final manufactured devices 
the terms of the perpetual license for our software restrict the customer s use to a specific project  such as a line of printers or digital cameras and  as a result  any software licenses or prepaid production license fees can generally only be used on that specific project 
under our perpetual license model  we sell our products at the specific project level and are dealing primarily with the engineers leading and making decisions for individual projects 
the strategy for our wind river platform products is to seek enterprise wide adoption 
as a result  the customer s decision to adopt our products is more strategic  leading to longer sales lead times and ultimately more complex and time consuming negotiations 
our success is therefore dependent upon our ability to first educate our current and potential customers of the value associated with our wind river platform products and services and  secondly  our ability to negotiate and close such transactions with these customers on terms which are mutually agreeable 
due to the fact that a significant portion of our business is sold under the subscription based enterprise licensing model  our reported revenue in a given quarter does not necessarily reflect our level of business activity 
under the subscription based enterprise license model  revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period 
by contrast  under applicable accounting rules for a perpetual license  the majority of license revenue is required to be recognized in the quarter in which the products are delivered and a much smaller amount relating to the fair value of maintenance to be deferred and recognized subsequently over the maintenance period 
therefore  an order for an enterprise license will result in lower current quarter revenue than an equal sized order for a perpetual license  but will result in increased deferred revenue compared to the perpetual license 
we expect customers to continue to migrate from perpetual licensing to enterprise licensing in the current year and this may impact the timing of our reported revenues 
the mix of enterprise licensing orders and perpetual orders in any given quarter can vary and may consequently also have an impact on that quarter s reported revenues 
recent operating results during fiscal  we continued to grow revenue and deferred revenue while improving our cash flow from operations 
growth in revenue and deferred revenue was primarily driven by an increase in our subscription based enterprise licensing business arising from additional focus on our device software optimization strategy and an improvement in the overall economy 

table of contents our total revenues were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million or and increased by million or in fiscal over revenues of million in fiscal our net income was  or per fully diluted share in fiscal our net income in fiscal was million or per fully diluted share and our net income in fiscal was million  or per fully diluted share 
our total deferred revenue has increased by to million at january  from million at january   and by at january  from million at january   primarily as a result of continued increases in sales of our subscription based enterprise license products 
short term deferred revenues have increased by to million at january  from million at january  of the total deferred revenue balance at january   million relates to deferred revenue classified as long term 
this deferred revenue relates to the portion of multi year contracts that is due to be recognized as revenue in a time period greater than one year from the balance sheet date 
we generated cash flows from operations of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal during fiscal  we settled the million remaining balance of our convertible subordinated notes on the maturity date using existing cash  cash equivalents and investment funds 
in fiscal  we also repurchased million shares of our common stock for an aggregate market price of million 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r beginning february  accordingly  during the fiscal year  we recorded stock based compensation expense for awards granted prior to  but not yet vested  as of february   as if the fair value method required for pro forma disclosure under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  were in effect for expense recognition purposes  adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
for stock based awards granted after february   we have recognized compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value method using the black scholes valuation model 
for all awards  we have continued to recognize compensation expense using a straight line amortization method 
as sfas r requires that stock based compensation expense be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest  stock based compensation for fiscal year has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
when estimating forfeitures  we consider historic termination behavior 
we calculated the fair value of each option award on the date of grant under the black scholes option pricing model using certain assumptions 
the computation of expected volatility for fiscal year is based on a combination of historical and market based implied volatility from traded options on our common stock 
prior to fiscal year  the computation of expected volatility was based on historical volatility 
the computation of expected lives for fiscal year  and was determined based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
the ranges provided for fiscal year result from the behavior patterns of separate groups of employees that have similar historical experience 
the interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant

impact of stock option review in may  the audit committee of the board of directors commenced a voluntary review of our historical stock option granting practices and the related accounting 
subsequently  in september  the board of directors appointed a special committee  comprised of a subset of the audit committee  which engaged independent legal counsel and accounting consultants to assist the special committee in its review 
the review covered the timing and pricing of all stock option grants made under our stock option plans since our initial public offering in based on the results of its review  the special committee concluded that we did not engage in intentional misrepresentation of consolidated financial statements or fraudulent misconduct in the granting of stock options 
however  due to certain errors identified in the course of the review  the accounting measurement dates for certain historical stock option grants differed from the actual grant dates 
as a result of revising the accounting measurement dates for these stock option grants  we identified errors totaling approximately million  net of tax benefits of million  related to stock based compensation expenses incurred primarily in fiscal year through fiscal year the impact of these errors  net of tax was       million  million   and  for fiscal year through fiscal year  respectively 
while these errors were not material to any previously filed financial statements  we concluded that correcting the aggregate error of approximately million would be material to our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal year  and accordingly  prior period accumulated deficit and additional paid in capital have been restated to record the cumulative non cash stock based compensation expense in this form k 
additional paid in capital and accumulated deficit were adjusted as of january   and as follows in thousands january  january  january  as reported as restated as reported as restated as reported as restated additional paid in capital accumulated deficit in addition  deferred tax assets related to certain net operating losses resulting from the exercise of employee stock options were reduced by million as a result of the loss of deductions under section m of the irc for fiscal years through these deferred tax assets had previously been fully reserved by a valuation allowance 
accordingly  we have restated our deferred tax assets relating to net operating losses and the associated valuation allowance at january  to reflect this adjustment 

table of contents recent developments in february  we acquired the intellectual property  including patents  copyrights  trademarks and associated product rights for rtlinux  developed by finite state machine labs  inc rtlinux is a commercially available  patented  hard real time linux technology 
we also acquired rights to future runtime revenue streams for assumed rtlinux contracts 
we paid cash consideration of approximately million  excluding acquisition related costs  for the net assets acquired 
we expect to account for this acquisition as a purchase transaction in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas  and accordingly the total consideration will be allocated to the intangible assets and tangible assets and liabilities acquired  based on their estimated fair values 
on march   the contractual restrictions imposed on the  shares of wind river common stock issued to certain founders of interpeak in connection with the acquisition of interpeak lapsed in accordance with their terms 
however  the shares remain subject to applicable securities laws and may not be sold  transferred  assigned  pledged or hypothecated except in accordance with the provisions of regulation s promulgated under the securities act of  as amended  pursuant to registration under the securities act  or pursuant to an available exemption from registration thereunder 
as discussed in item  market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  our repurchase plan authorized the purchase of million of our common stock  of which million remained available for repurchase as of january  from march  through april   we repurchased  shares of our common stock for a total cost of million and an average price of per share 
as a result of these repurchases  we completed the repurchase plan 
acquisitions in march  we acquired interpeak ab interpeak  a privately held swedish company  for approximately million  comprised of million in cash consideration  plus direct acquisition costs 
interpeak provides networking  security  and mobility middleware software that enables devices to connect to the internet  which will deepen and broaden our product offerings 
we accounted for this acquisition as a non taxable purchase and  in accordance with sfas the total consideration was allocated to the intangible assets and tangible assets and liabilities acquired  based on their estimated fair values

the goodwill of million represents our assigned value for the long term potential of the integration of interpeak into our overall product strategy

critical accounting policies and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap 
the application of us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements describes our significant accounting policies which are reviewed by us on a regular basis and which are also reviewed by senior management with the audit committee of our board of directors 
an accounting policy is deemed by us to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
the policies and estimates that we believe are most critical to an understanding of our financial results and condition and that require a higher degree of judgment and complexity are revenue recognition  estimating sales returns and other allowances  and allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangibles  accounting for income taxes  and stock based compensation revenue recognition we recognize revenues from three sources product revenues  subscription revenues and service revenues  in each case  net of sales returns and other allowances 
product revenues consist of revenues from production licenses sometimes referred to as royalties  and fees for stand alone software and software programming tools sold under our perpetual licensing model and from sales of our hardware 
subscription revenues consist primarily of revenues from the licensing of products and services under our enterprise licensing model  including items such as development tools  an operating system  various protocols and interfaces and maintenance and training  which are licensed over a limited period of time  typically months 
service revenues are derived from fees from professional services  which include design and development fees  software maintenance contracts  and customer training and consulting 
agreements generally do not allow the right of return or sales price adjustments 
we recognize revenues in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended sop  sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition sab 
we recognize revenues when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an 
table of contents arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the vendor s fee is fixed or determinable and collection is determined to be probable 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we recognize revenue when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe exists for all undelivered elements of the arrangement or at the point when all elements have been delivered 
these criteria are further defined as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
it is our customary practice for arrangements other than a clickwrap agreement to have non cancelable contracts and generally a customer purchase order prior to recognizing revenues on an arrangement 
for products purchased under a clickwrap agreement it is generally our customary practice to have a customer purchase order prior to recognizing revenues 
delivery has occurred 
product revenues for software and hardware are recognized at the time of shipment or upon the delivery of a product master  with standard transfer terms of fob shipping point 
if undelivered products or services exist that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an arrangement  delivery is not considered to have occurred 
if only non essential products or services are undelivered and if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the recognition of fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
we recognize revenues from time based and subscription based licenses ratably over the term of the agreement 
our enterprise license model agreements require that we deliver unspecified future updates and upgrades within the same product family during the subscription term 
accordingly  fees from our enterprise license agreements are recognized ratably over their term 
if an agreement includes a specified upgrade  all revenue that would have otherwise been recognized is deferred until the specified upgrade is delivered 
sales to original equipment manufacturers  system integrators and value added resellers are recognized at the time delivery has occurred for perpetual licenses and ratably over the related term for subscription licenses 
sales to distributors are generally recognized as noted above provided that we have evidence of an end user agreement 
professional service revenues are generally separately priced  are available from a number of suppliers  and are typically not essential to the functionality of our software products 
revenues from these services are recognized separately from the license fee if the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined by sop generally  revenue from time and materials consulting contracts are recognized as services are performed 
contract accounting is utilized for service revenues from fixed price contracts that require significant software modification  development or customization 
in such instances  the arrangement fee is accounted for in accordance with sop  whereby the arrangement fee is recognized  generally using the percentage of completion method measured on labor input costs 
if increases in projected costs to complete are sufficient to create a loss contract  the entire estimated loss is charged to operations in the period the loss first becomes known 
to date these losses have not been significant 
the complexity of the estimation process and judgments related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization  changes to specification and testing requirements and collectibility of unbilled receivables 
service revenues from software maintenance  support and update fees are recognized ratably over the contract period  which is typically months 
service revenues from training and consulting are recognized when the services are provided 
in the case where we execute more than one contract or agreement with a single customer we evaluate each to determine whether the separate contracts or agreements should be viewed as one multiple element 
table of contents arrangement 
where the determination of a multiple element arrangement is made  we recognize revenue only if sufficient vsoe exists to allocate revenue to the various elements of the arrangement or at the point when all elements have been delivered 
the vendor s fee is fixed or determinable 
at the time of each transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with a revenue transaction is fixed or determinable based on the payment and other terms associated with the transaction 
for product and subscription revenues  if a significant portion of a fee is due after our standard payment terms  which are generally no greater than days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  revenue is recognized as the fees become due subject to all other revenue recognition criteria being met 
collection is probable 
we assess probability of collection based on a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
new customers and certain existing customers are subject to a credit review process that evaluates each customer s financial position and ultimately its ability to pay according to the original terms of the arrangement 
based on our review process  if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collection of the resulting receivable is not probable  then revenue is recognized on a cash collected basis 
vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we establish vsoe for maintenance services by reference to substantive stated future renewal rates included in contracts or the amounts charged on similar transactions 
we establish vsoe for professional services time and materials contracts by reference to standard hourly rates separately charged for services 
we do not have vsoe for professional services fixed price contracts 
where such services are sold in conjunction with other products  significant management judgment is required to determine appropriate revenue recognition 
significant management judgments and estimates are made in connection with the revenues recognized in any accounting period 
we must assess whether the fee associated with a revenue transaction is fixed or determinable  whether or not collection is probable  whether vsoe exists for all elements of a transaction or multiple element arrangement and the related revenue recognition impact of this and  for fixed price contracts  make estimates of costs to complete 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of revenues for any period if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
estimating sales returns and other allowances  and allowance for doubtful accounts we record estimated reductions in revenue for potential returns of products by customers and other allowances 
as a result  management must make estimates of potential future product returns and other allowances related to current period product revenue 
in making such estimates  management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates  material differences in the amount of our reported revenue could result 
the provision for sales returns and other allowances was million and million at january  and  respectively 
the provision represents and as a percentage of net revenues  for fiscal years and  respectively 
similarly  management makes estimates of the non collectibility of accounts receivables  specifically analyzing accounts receivable and historical bad debts  geographic concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms  when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition to the identification of individual specific doubtful accounts receivable  we provide allowances for other accounts receivable based on our historical experience 
if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates  material differences in the amount of our reported operating expenses could result 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at january  and  respectively 
the allowance represents and as a percentage of gross accounts receivable  as at january  and  respectively

table of contents valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangibles goodwill and purchased intangibles 
intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of entities accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are estimated by management based on the fair value of assets received 
these include acquired customer base  technological know how  trademarks and goodwill 
intangible assets  other than goodwill are amortized over the estimated useful lives ranging from one year to seven years on a straight line basis 
significant management judgment is involved in assessing the fair value of goodwill and purchased intangible assets received 
the primary methods used to determine the fair value of assets received is the income approach  under which we must make assumptions as to the future cash flows of the acquired entity or assets  the appropriate discount rate to use to present value the cash flows and the anticipated life of the acquired assets  and the market approach  under which we compare the value of our business unit to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business 
if we made different judgments  material differences in the amount of fair value assigned to purchased intangibles and goodwill could arise 
we review goodwill for impairment annually in the second quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
we currently operate as one segment and have one reporting unit 
the primary methods used to determine the fair value of goodwill for impairment purposes were the income and market approaches 
the assumptions supporting the income approach  including the discount rate  which was assumed to be for both fiscal and fiscal and for fiscal  were determined using our best estimates as of the date of the impairment review 
goodwill was million at january  and million at january  and purchased intangibles  net  were million and million at january  and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires the recognition of the impairment of long lived assets when circumstances indicate an impairment has occurred and in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
accordingly  we evaluate asset recoverability when an event occurs that may impair recoverability of the asset 
we determine the recoverability of the carrying amount of each asset by reviewing the following factors the undiscounted value of expected operating cash flows in relation to its net capital investments  the estimated useful or contractual life of the asset  the contract or product supporting the asset 
in the case of purchased intangibles and capitalized software development costs  we periodically review the recoverability of the asset s value by evaluating its products with respect to technological advances  competitive products and the needs of its customers 
a significant portion of our long lived assets  including goodwill  are located in north america 
the assessment for any required impairment charge for goodwill  purchased intangibles and other long lived assets is based upon estimated discounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the goodwill  purchased intangibles or long lived assets using an appropriate discount rate that incorporates our cost of capital and the risk profile of the associated investment 
the assumptions supporting the cash flows  including the discount rates  are determined using our best estimates as of the date of the impairment review 
these estimates are highly subjective and require significant management judgment as these estimates require us to make assumptions regarding future operating results  which are inherently difficult to predict 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
accounting for income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  income tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
judgment is applied to estimate taxable income by jurisdiction and our ability to utilize any unexpired credits and or net operating losses 
we are subject to income tax audits in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
table of contents and  as a result  must also assess exposures to any potential issues arising from current or future audits of current and prior years tax returns 
accordingly  we must assess such potential exposure and  where necessary  provide a reserve to cover any expected loss 
to the extent that we establish a reserve  our provision for income taxes would be increased 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
in addition for year ended january   we realized benefits of  arising from the release of tax reserves upon the expiration of the statute of limitation in a foreign jurisdiction 
during the years ended january   and  we realized benefits of   and million  respectively  arising from the final assessment of foreign tax audits 
our tax rate may also vary based on our results and the mix of income or loss amongst the domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
deferred income taxes are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  and are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using the tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
sfas provides for recognition of deferred tax assets if the realization of such assets is more likely than not to occur 
with the exception of primarily the us jurisdiction  we have determined that it is more likely than not that our deferred taxes will be realized 
accordingly  we have recorded a deferred tax asset of million and million  related to certain international jurisdictions and a full valuation allowance against the remainder of our deferred tax assets at january  and  respectively 
should we determine that we would be able to realize our remaining deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future  an adjustment to our remaining deferred tax assets would cause a material increase to income in the period such determination is made 
significant management judgment is required in determining the period in which the reversal of a valuation allowance should occur 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  such as historical levels of income and future forecasts of taxable income amongst other items in determining whether a full or partial release of a valuation allowance was required 
in addition  our assessments sometimes require us to schedule future taxable income in accordance with sfas to assess the appropriateness of a valuation allowance which further requires the exercise of significant management judgment 
following our analyses  in fiscal we released our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the united kingdom and in fiscal we released our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in austria  canada  sweden  israel and released part of our valuation allowance in japan 
the release of these valuation allowances caused an incremental tax benefit of million and million to be recognized in fiscal and  respectively 
the valuation allowance at january  is million and relates primarily to deferred tax assets held in the us 
we will continue to evaluate the ability to realize  by jurisdiction  our deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances on a quarterly basis 
stock based compensation we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r beginning february  accordingly  during the fiscal year  we recorded stock based compensation expenses for awards granted prior to  but not yet vested  as of february   as if the fair value method required for pro forma disclosure under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  were in effect for expense recognition purposes  adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
for stock based awards granted after february   we have recognized compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value method using the black scholes valuation model 
for all awards  we have continued to recognize compensation expense using a straight line amortization method 
as sfas r requires that stock based compensation expense be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest  stock based compensation for fiscal year has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
when estimating forfeitures  we consider historic termination behavior 
the adoption of the standard had a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

table of contents we calculated the fair value of each option award on the date of grant under the black scholes option pricing model using certain assumptions 
the computation of expected volatility for fiscal year is based on a combination of historical and market based implied volatility from traded options on our common stock 
prior to fiscal year  the computation of expected volatility was based on historical volatility 
we believe that using a combination of historical and market based implied volatility from traded options on our common stock is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than relying solely on historical volatility 
the computation of expected lives for fiscal year  and was determined based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
the ranges provided for fiscal year result from the behavior patterns of separate groups of employees that have similar historical experience 
the interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the application of sfas r is very complex and requires reliance on significant management assumptions  judgments and estimates  including volatility  expected term and forfeiture rates 
the application of different assumptions  judgments or estimates could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
see note  stock based compensation plans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these assumptions 
results of operations for the years ended january   and revenues we recognize revenues from three sources product revenues  subscription revenues and service revenues  in each case  net of sales returns and other allowances 
product revenues consist of revenues from production licenses sometimes referred to as royalties  fees for stand alone software and software programming tools sold under our perpetual licensing model  and from sales of our hardware 
subscription revenues consist of revenues from the licensing of products and services under our enterprise licensing model including items such as development tools  an operating system  various protocols and interfaces and maintenance and training  which are licensed over a limited period of time  typically months 
service revenues are derived from fees from professional services  which include design and development fees  software maintenance contracts  and customer training and consulting

the increase in total revenues in fiscal compared to was primarily due to increased subscription revenues earned under our enterprise licensing model 
our product revenues have been affected by a decline in our perpetual license revenues as a result of the continued customer adoption of our subscription based development licenses 
fees from the subscription based licenses are recorded in deferred revenue and are recognized ratably as subscription revenue over the license term  which is typically one year 
in contrast  under our perpetual model  a significant percentage of the transaction fee is recognized in the quarter the transaction is completed 
while the continued customer adoption 
table of contents of our subscription based development licenses has impacted our product revenues  our deferred revenues grew by million from million at january  to million at january  our service revenues  in particular maintenance revenues  have also been affected by the continued increase in adoption of our subscription based development licenses due to the fact that support services under the enterprise licensing model are recorded as subscription revenues  rather than service revenues  as they are when related to maintenance on a perpetual license 
product revenues product revenues are comprised of perpetual development license revenues  including hardware revenues  and production license revenues from both perpetual and subscription licensing

years ended january  percentage of total revenues  net in thousands  except percentages perpetual license revenues production license revenues total product revenues perpetual license revenues declined or million in fiscal compared to fiscal and declined or million in fiscal compared to fiscal perpetual license revenues have sequentially decreased as a percentage of revenue in fiscal  and due primarily to the continued customer adoption of our subscription based wind river platforms  which are accounted for as subscription revenues  and were partially offset by incremental revenues of approximately million from the interpeak acquisition 
we expect perpetual license and hardware revenues to be relatively flat during fiscal production license revenues decreased or million in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased or million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was due to lower revenues derived from our license compliance programs  together with declines in revenues from production licenses related to legacy products 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from the growing networking and consumer devices segments  further improvement in our execution of our license compliance program  which includes increased monitoring of customer license compliance and improvement in our customers own quarterly reporting processes 
we expect production license revenues to be relatively flat in absolute dollars in fiscal subscription revenues subscription revenues increased or million in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased or million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal from fiscal resulted primarily from the increasing volume of our subscription business 
the significant increase in fiscal from fiscal was due primarily to the continued transition of a number of our customers from our traditional perpetual licensing model to our wind river platforms under our subscription model  and increasing volumes of subscription business with these customers

the increase in international revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a increase in revenues from emea  a increase in revenues from japan  and a increase in revenues from asia pacific 
the increases in revenues in each geographic area over these periods resulted primarily from higher customer demand for our software  both domestically and internationally 
the impact of foreign exchange rate movements did not have a significant impact on international revenues during fiscal  or our international sales are primarily denominated in united states dollars  euros  british pounds and japanese yen 
as is the case with north america  our international revenues have also been affected by the increasing volume of subscription business  where revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period as opposed to our perpetual license model where revenue is generally recognized immediately 
we expect international sales to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues  although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period 

table of contents deferred revenues our deferred revenues consisted of the following january  dollar change percentage change in thousands  except percentages current deferred revenues subscription maintenance and other total current deferred revenues long term deferred revenues subscription maintenance and other total long term deferred revenues total deferred revenues deferred subscription revenues represent customer billings and payments made in advance for software licensed over a subscription period

maintenance is typically billed on a per annum basis in advance and revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
deferred service revenues include pre payments for software consulting and training services 
deferred product revenues primarily include software license transactions that are not separable from consulting services 
revenue for these contracts is recognized as the services are performed 
the growth in subscription deferred revenues results from increasing business activity levels for this business model and the continued customer adoption of our wind river platforms enterprise license model 
the growth in deferred revenues for maintenance and other during fiscal relates primarily to additional deferred consulting and product revenue  due to timing differences between customer billings and revenue recognition 
cost of revenues years ended january  percentage of associated revenues  net in thousands  except percentages product subscription service amortization of purchased intangibles total cost of revenues gross profit gross profit percentage the general increase in overall costs of products and services  excluding amortization of purchased intangibles  was primarily attributable to increased personnel related costs  including stock based compensation recognized under sfas r  associated with increasing levels of business  particularly service costs  and increased amortization of purchased intangibles

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have an investment policy that has been approved by our board of directors 
we place our investments with high quality credit issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our investment policy  our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss 
consequently  we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to be low risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio  we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio 
based on investment positions as of january   an immediate hypothetical parallel shift to the yield curve of plus basis points bps  bps and bps would result in a reduction of   and  respectively  in the market value of our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio consists of various marketable debt securities 
the longer the duration of these securities  the more susceptible these securities are to general changes in market interest rates
