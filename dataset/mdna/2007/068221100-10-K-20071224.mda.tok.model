item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in the understanding of the consolidated balance sheets of barnwell industries  inc and subsidiaries collectively referred to herein as barnwell  we  our  us or the company as of september  and  and the related consolidated statements of earnings  stockholders equity and comprehensive income  and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended september  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management of barnwell to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
critical accounting policies and estimates management believes the accounting policies that are most critical in assisting financial statement readers in understanding and evaluating our results due to their subjective judgments are as follows oil and natural gas properties full cost ceiling calculation and depletion policy description we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties  under which we are required to conduct quarterly calculations of a ceiling  or limitation on the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties 
the ceiling limitation is the sum of the discounted present value at  using prices as of the end of each reporting period on a constant basis  of barnwell s estimated future net cash flows from estimated production of proved oil and natural gas reserves  less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves but excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations accrued on the balance sheet  plus the cost of major development projects and unproven properties not subject to depletion  if any  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in costs subject to depletion  less related income tax effects 
if net capitalized costs exceed this limit  the excess is expensed unless subsequent market price changes eliminate or reduce the indicated write down in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin topic d 
judgments and assumptions the estimate of our oil and natural gas reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments 
estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data  historical data  projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires substantial judgment  resulting in imprecise determinations  particularly for new discoveries 
our reserve estimates are prepared annually by independent petroleum engineers and quarterly by internal personnel 
the passage of time provides more quantitative and qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves  and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information 
in the past three fiscal years  annual revisions to our reserve volume estimates have averaged of the previous year s estimate 
however  there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future 
if future significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities  such revisions could result in a write down of oil and natural gas properties 
if reported reserve volumes were revised downward by at the end of fiscal  the ceiling limitation would have decreased approximately  this decrease would not have resulted in a write down in fiscal in addition to the impact of the estimates of proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling  estimated proved reserves are also a significant component of the quarterly calculation of depletion expense 
the lower the estimated reserves  the higher the depletion rate per unit of production 
conversely  the higher the estimated reserves  the lower the depletion rate per unit of production 
if reported reserve volumes were revised downward by as of the beginning of fiscal  depletion for fiscal would have increased by approximately  while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment  the associated prices of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves  and the applicable discount rate  that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment 
the ceiling calculation dictates that a discount factor be used and that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are held constant indefinitely which results in a value that is not necessarily indicative of the fair market value of the reserves 
therefore  the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs 
rather  they are based on such prices and costs in effect as of the end of each period for which the ceiling calculation is performed 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile 
therefore  oil and natural gas property write downs that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation  and that are caused by fluctuations in prices as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves  should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 
on october   the alberta government announced increases to the royalty rates on oil  natural gas liquids and natural gas production beginning on january  the new plan also intends to simplify royalties and eliminate old and new classifications of oil and natural gas with current maximum royalty rates of with new royalty rates up to 
the new proposed royalty rate is reached for oil when oil is selling at or above canadian dollars per barrel and for natural gas when natural gas is selling at or above canadian dollars per mcf 
barnwell is awaiting clarification from the alberta government on the new program and is in the process of assessing its impact 
the new program may reduce barnwell s natural gas and oil reserve volumes  reported net production  and estimated future revenues and estimated future cash flows from natural gas and oil reserves 
the new program may also materially impact the economics of oil and natural gas exploration in the alberta area 
however  the magnitude of the potential impact  which will depend on the final form of legislation upon enactment  cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
income taxes policy description deferred income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax impacts of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
judgments and assumptions we make estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for each reporting period 
significant changes to these estimates could result in an increase or decrease in our tax provision in future periods 
we are also required to make judgments about the recoverability of deferred tax assets and when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance is provided 
changes in the assumptions regarding the realization of deferred tax assets could result in an increase or decrease in our income tax provision 
furthermore  changes in our business performance could require a valuation allowance or a reversal in the valuation allowance in future periods 
the impact of any of these changes could be material 
historically  our current income tax estimates have not materially differed from our income tax returns filed with taxing authorities 
however  there can be no assurance that material differences will not occur in the future 
barnwell has established a valuation allowance primarily for the us tax effect of deferred canadian taxes  accrued expenses and state of hawaii net operating loss carryforwards which may not be realizable in future years as there can be no assurance of any specific level of earnings or that the timing of us taxable income will coincide with the payment of canadian taxes to enable canadian taxes to be a fully beneficial deduction for us tax purposes 
canadian deferred tax assets related to expenses accrued for book purposes but not for tax purposes are estimated to be realized through future canadian income tax deductions against future canadian oil and natural gas earnings 
us deferred tax assets related to expenses accrued for book purposes but not for tax purposes and the excess of the cost basis of investment in land for tax purposes over the cost basis of investment in land for book purposes are estimated to be realized from deductions against future us earnings from sales of interests in leasehold land and land development rights 
foreign tax credit carryforwards are estimated to be utilized when us federal income taxes otherwise due on canadian source income in a given year exceed the foreign tax credit generated in that year 
the foreign tax credit carryforwards expire in fiscal the amount of deferred income tax assets considered realizable may be reduced if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
asset retirement obligation policy description barnwell accounts for asset retirement obligations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
barnwell s estimated site restoration and abandonment costs of its oil and natural gas properties are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of oil and natural gas properties and depleted over the life of the related reserves 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to oil and natural gas operating expense 
if an obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  barnwell will recognize a gain or loss on settlement 
judgments and assumptions the asset retirement obligation is recorded at fair value in the period in which it is incurred along with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related asset 
barnwell has estimated fair value by discounting the estimated future cash outflows required to settle abandonment and restoration liabilities 
the present value calculation includes numerous estimates  assumptions and judgments regarding the existence of liabilities  the amount and timing of cash outflows required to settle the liability  what constitutes adequate restoration  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  and consideration of changes in legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
abandonment and restoration cost estimates are determined in conjunction with barnwell s reserve engineers based on historical information regarding costs incurred to abandon and restore similar well sites  information regarding current market conditions and costs  and knowledge of subject well sites and properties 
the process of estimating the asset retirement obligation requires substantial judgment and use of estimates  resulting in imprecise determinations 
following the implementation of sfas no 
 actual asset retirement obligations through the end of fiscal have not materially differed from our estimates 
however  because of the inherent imprecision of estimates as described above  there can be no assurance that material differences will not occur in the future 
a increase in accretion and depletion related to the asset retirement obligation would have increased barnwell s fiscal expenses before taxes by approximately contractual obligations the following table presents significant contractual obligations of barnwell as of september   estimating that barnwell s credit facility with royal bank of canada will be renewed on each annual renewal date  currently april payments due by fiscal year contractual obligations total after long term debt operating leases retirement plans total there is no assurance that royal bank of canada will in fact extend the term of the facility on each renewal date or that the facility will be renewed at its current amount 
the following table lists barnwell s significant contractual obligations as of september  assuming that the facility will not be renewed on the next renewal date  april  for which repayment  if any  has been deferred until no sooner than october   and that barnwell then elects to convert the revolving facility to term status payments due by fiscal year contractual obligations total after long term debt operating leases retirement plans total required principal payments only 
assumes barnwell s credit facility with royal bank of canada will be renewed on each annual renewal date  currently april amounts include scheduled minimum rental payments of non cancelable operating leases for office space and leasehold land 
the lease payments for land were subject to renegotiation as of january  per the lease agreement  the lease payments will remain unchanged pending an appraisal  whereupon the lease rent will be adjusted to fair market value 
barnwell does not know the amount of the new lease payments which could be effective upon performance of the appraisal  they may remain unchanged or increase  and barnwell currently expects the adjustment  if any  to not be material 
the future rental payment disclosures above assume the minimum lease payments for land in effect at december  remain unchanged through december  the end of the lease term 
amounts represent our obligations under our defined benefit pension plan  supplemental employee retirement plan  and postretirement medical insurance benefits plan 
overview barnwell is engaged in the following lines of business exploring for  developing  producing and selling oil and natural gas essentially all in canada oil and natural gas segment  investment in leasehold land and other real estate interests in hawaii land investment segment  acquisition of property for investment and development of homes for sale real estate development segment  established january and drilling wells and installing and repairing water pumping systems in hawaii contract drilling segment 
oil and natural gas segment barnwell sells substantially all of its oil and condensate production under short term contracts with marketers of oil 
natural gas sold by barnwell is generally sold under both long term and short term contracts with prices indexed to market prices 
the price of natural gas  oil and natural gas liquids is freely negotiated between the buyers and sellers 
market prices for petroleum products are dependent upon factors such as  but not limited to  changes in weather  storage levels  and output 
petroleum and natural gas prices are very difficult to predict and fluctuate significantly 
for example  natural gas prices for barnwell  based on quarterly averages during the three years ended september   have ranged from a low of per thousand cubic feet to a high of per thousand cubic feet  and tend to be higher in the winter than in the summer due to increased demand 
oil and natural gas exploration  development and operating costs generally follow trends in product market prices  thus in times of higher product prices the cost of exploration  development and operation of oil and natural gas properties will tend to escalate as well 
barnwell s oil and natural gas operations make capital expenditures in the exploration  development  and production of oil and natural gas 
cash outlays for capital expenditures are largely discretionary  however  a minimum level of capital expenditures is required to replace depleting reserves 
due to the nature of oil and natural gas exploration and development  significant uncertainty exists as to the ultimate success of any drilling effort 
land investment segment barnwell owns a controlling interest in kaupulehu developments  a hawaii general partnership which owns interests in leasehold land and development rights for property located approximately six miles north of the kona international airport in the north kona district of the island of hawaii  within and adjacent to the hualalai resort at historic ka upulehu  between the queen kaahumanu highway and the pacific ocean 
mr 
terry johnston  a director of barnwell and minority interest owner in certain of barnwell s business ventures  and his affiliated entities own a direct financial interest in of kaupulehu developments 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item for further discussion on related party interests 
kaupulehu developments development rights are under option to a developer for  as of september   comprised of four payments of  due on each december of years to in february  kaupulehu developments entered into a purchase and sale agreement with an independent buyer whereby kaupulehu developments transferred its leasehold interest in approximately acres zoned for resort residential development  in two increments  to the buyer 
for the first increment increment i  kaupulehu developments received an  cash closing payment in february and is also entitled to receive future payments from the buyer based on the following percentages of gross receipts from the developer s sales of single family residential lots in increment i of the gross proceeds from single family lot sales up to aggregate gross proceeds of  of such aggregate gross proceeds greater than  but less than  and of such aggregate gross proceeds in excess of  in june  kaupulehu developments entered into an agreement whereby kaupulehu developments sold its interest in the second increment increment ii  representing the remainder of the aforementioned approximately acres 
pursuant to this agreement  kaupulehu developments received  and is entitled to receive future payments from the buyer based on a percentage of the sales prices of the residential lots  ranging from to  to be determined in the future depending upon a number of variables  including whether the lots are sold prior to improvement 
this agreement also provides the buyer with the exclusive right to negotiate with kaupulehu developments with respect to lot c lot c  which is comprised of approximately  acres of vacant leasehold land zoned conservation located adjacent to increment ii 
this right expires in june or  if the buyer completes any and all environmental assessments and surveys reasonably required to support a petition to the hawaii state land use commission for reclassification of lot c zoning  in june the area in which kaupulehu developments interests are located has experienced demand for premium residential real estate in recent years  however there is no assurance that this will continue or that any future development rights or percentage of sales payments will be received 
kaupulehu mauka investors  llc  a limited liability company wholly owned by barnwell  holds lot acquisition rights as to lots within approximately  acres of agricultural zoned leasehold land in the upland area of kaupulehu mauka lands situated between the queen kaahumanu highway and the mamalahoa highway at kaupulehu  north kona  island and state of hawaii 
the lot acquisition rights give barnwell the right to acquire residential lots which may be developed on the mauka lands  which are currently classified as agricultural by the state of hawaii 
real estate development segment barnwell owns an controlling interest in kaupulehu  lllp kaupulehu  a hawaii limited liability limited partnership  which acquires house lots for investment and to construct turnkey single family homes for future sale 
mr 
terry johnston  a director of barnwell and minority interest owner in certain of barnwell s business ventures  and his affiliates hold certain interests in kaupulehu refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item for further discussion on related party interests 
kaupulehu is in the process of obtaining building permits for the two homes to be constructed and anticipates construction on the first home to begin during the second quarter of fiscal contract drilling segment barnwell drills water  water monitoring and geothermal wells and installs and repairs water pumping systems in hawaii 
contract drilling results are highly dependent upon the quantity  dollar value and timing of contracts awarded by governmental and private entities and can fluctuate significantly 
water well drilling and pump installation activity remained at the same levels during fiscal as compared to the prior year  and management expects a moderate increase in these activities in fiscal  as compared to fiscal results of operations summary barnwell generated net earnings of  in fiscal  an  decrease from net earnings of  in fiscal net earnings for fiscal decreased as net earnings of the prior fiscal year included the receipt of a closing payment from the sale of increment ii of kaupulehu developments leasehold land interests  which generated a  operating profit  after minority interest and before taxes  and proceeds from real estate consulting services rendered 
there was no closing payment or real estate consulting proceeds received in fiscal also contributing to the decrease was the recognition of  of deferred tax benefits due to a reduction in the valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carryforwards and  of deferred tax benefits due to a reduction of canadian income tax rates during fiscal there was no reduction in the valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carryforwards in fiscal the decrease was further attributable to lower prices received by barnwell for natural gas and natural gas liquids in the current year  as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in net earnings was partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses in the current fiscal year due primarily to reduced bonus expense and a decrease in costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance efforts 
the fiscal year average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar increased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and the exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar increased at september   as compared to september  this increase in the value of the canadian dollar in us dollars increased barnwell s reported revenues and expenses and assets and liabilities 
barnwell generated net earnings of  in fiscal  an  increase from net earnings of  in fiscal the increase was due in part to the receipt of a payment from the sale of increment ii of kaupulehu developments leasehold land interests which generated an operating profit  after minority interest and before taxes  of approximately  higher prices received by barnwell for all petroleum products  the receipt of percentage of sales payments from the sale of lots in increment i of the leasehold land interest previously held by kaupulehu developments  and proceeds from real estate consulting services rendered 
the increase was also due in part to the recognition of  of deferred tax benefits due to a reduction in the valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carryforwards and  of deferred tax benefits due to a reduction in canadian income tax rates 
there were no increment ii receipts  percentage of sales payments  or real estate consulting proceeds received in fiscal  nor were there reductions in the valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carryforwards or canadian tax rates in fiscal oil and natural gas revenues selected operating statistics the following tables set forth barnwell s annual net production and annual average price per unit of production for fiscal as compared to fiscal  and fiscal as compared to fiscal production amounts reported are net of royalties and the alberta royalty tax credit  where applicable 
as discussed in further detail below  the alberta royalty tax credit was discontinued effective january  fiscal fiscal annual net production increase decrease units natural gas mcf oil bbl liquids bbl annual average price per unit increase decrease natural gas mcf oil bbl liquids bbl fiscal fiscal annual net production increase units natural gas mcf oil bbl liquids bbl annual average price per unit increase natural gas mcf oil bbl liquids bbl mcf  cubic feet 
natural gas price per unit is net of pipeline charges 
bbl stock tank barrel equivalent to us gallons oil and natural gas revenues decreased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  due primarily to decreases in prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids 
oil prices in fiscal were essentially equivalent to oil prices in fiscal net natural gas production in fiscal was essentially unchanged from that of fiscal gross natural gas production decreased in fiscal  as compared fiscal  due to natural declines in production from older properties and declines at certain newer properties due to various operational issues 
the impact of the decreases in gross production was largely offset by lower royalties as a percentage of revenues  due in part to lower prices  which reduced the royalty owners share of gas production 
at dunvegan  barnwell s principal oil and gas property  gross natural gas production decreased  mcf due to natural declines from older wells  whereas net natural gas production at dunvegan increased  mcf due to a decrease in royalties as a percentage of revenues  due in part to lower prices 
gross natural gas production increased at barnwell s newer properties at pouce coupe south  progress  boundary lake and bilawchuk  but the increase was more than offset by declines at doris  bonanza  and malmo  which are also newer properties 
the alberta royalty tax credit artc program was discontinued by the alberta government  effective january  in fiscal years   and  barnwell received   and  respectively  under the artc program 
the artc payments were recorded as a credit against oil and natural gas royalties and reported in oil and natural gas revenues 
on october   the alberta government announced increases to the royalty rates on oil  natural gas liquids and natural gas production beginning on january  the new plan also intends to simplify royalties and eliminate old and new classifications of oil and natural gas with current maximum royalty rates of with new royalty rates up to 
the new proposed royalty rate is reached for oil when oil is selling at or above canadian dollars per barrel and for natural gas when natural gas is selling at or above canadian dollars per mcf 
barnwell is awaiting clarification from the alberta government on the new program and is in the process of assessing its impact 
the new program may reduce barnwell s natural gas and oil reserve volumes  reported net production  and estimated future revenues and estimated future cash flows from natural gas and oil reserves 
the new program may also materially impact the economics of oil and natural gas exploration in the alberta area 
however  the magnitude of the potential impact  which will depend on the final form of legislation upon enactment  cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
oil and natural gas revenues increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  due to increases in prices for all petroleum products 
fiscal net natural gas production increased  mcf at dunvegan  and net natural gas production also increased at doris  boundary lake  wood river and bonanza balsam 
the increase was more than offset by declines at progress  leduc  malmo and pouce coupe south 
net oil production increased  barrels in fiscal due to increased production from the progress and wood river areas 
the increase was partially offset by declines in oil production from the bonanza balsam area and the red earth area 
oil and natural gas operating expenses operating expenses increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal operating expenses increased due to higher utility costs  industry wide cost pressures which resulted in higher oilfield services costs  and higher than usual workover activity which resulted in higher repairs and maintenance costs 
the increase was also due to a increase in the average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar that increased oil and natural gas operating expenses  in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
operating expenses increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal the increase was due to higher fuel  utilities and oilfield services costs at all properties  and higher repairs and maintenance costs at older properties and to a increase in the average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar that increased oil and natural gas operating expenses  in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
sale of development rights  sale of interest in leasehold land  and minority interest in earnings the development rights held by kaupulehu developments are for residentially zoned leasehold land within and adjacent to the hualalai golf club and are under option to hualalai investors  an entity in which barnwell acquired a passive minority interest through an owned joint venture in fiscal the development rights were previously under option to kaupulehu makai venture  an unrelated entity 
hualalai investors acquired the development rights option from kaupulehu makai venture in june net revenues from the sale of development rights were   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
in december  kaupulehu developments received a payment of  representing the development rights option due on december  in november  kaupulehu developments received a payment of  representing payment of the development rights option due on december  of  and a  portion of its development rights option due on december  in december  hualalai investors paid kaupulehu developments  upon exercising the balance of its development rights option due on december  revenue from the development rights sales received in fiscal years  and were reduced by   and  respectively  of fees related to the sales  resulting in net revenues of   and  respectively 
operating profits  after minority interest  from the development rights sales were   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
all capitalized costs associated with kaupulehu developments development rights were expensed in previous years 
the development rights option revenues  net of related fees  are recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings as sale of development rights  net 
the total amount of remaining future option receipts  if all options are fully exercised  was  as of september   comprised of four payments of  due on each december of years to in october  kaupulehu developments received a  development rights option payment for a portion of the seventh payment due on december  this development rights option payment will be recognized in barnwell s first quarter of fiscal if any annual option payment is not made  the then remaining development right options will expire 
there is no assurance that any portion of the remaining options will be exercised 
in february  kaupulehu developments entered into a purchase and sale agreement with wb kd acquisition  llc wb  an unrelated entity 
wb is affiliated with rp hualalai investors  llc  a managing member of hualalai investors  owners and current developers of hualalai resort  and westbrook partners  developers of kuki o resort located adjacent to hualalai resort 
under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement  kaupulehu developments transferred its leasehold interest in approximately acres zoned for resort residential development  in two increments increment i and increment ii  to wb 
increment i is an area planned for approximately single family lots and a beach club on the portion of the property bordering the pacific ocean 
the purchasers of the single family lots will have the right to apply for membership in the kuki o resort golf and beach club  which is located adjacent to and south of the four seasons resort hualalai at historic ka upulehu 
increment ii is the remaining portion of the approximately acre property and is zoned for single family and multi family residential units and a golf course and clubhouse 
with respect to increment i  kaupulehu developments received an  payment in february and is entitled to receive payments from wb based on the following percentages of the gross receipts from wb s sales of single family residential lots in increment i of the gross proceeds from single family lot sales up to aggregate gross proceeds of  of such aggregate gross proceeds greater than  but less than  and of such aggregate gross proceeds in excess of  wb sold a total of five single family lots and paid kaupulehu developments  in percentage of sales payments during the year ended september  the revenue from the fiscal percentage of sales payments was reduced by  of fees related to the sales  resulting in net revenues of  and a  operating profit  after minority interest 
wb sold an additional seven single family lots during the year ended september  and paid kaupulehu developments  in percentage of sales payments 
three of the seven lots sold by wb in fiscal were purchased by kaupulehu  a hawaii limited liability limited partnership owned by barnwell and owned by nearco  inc nearco  established during the second quarter of fiscal for the purpose of acquiring house lots for investment and to construct turnkey single family homes for future sale 
nearco is a company controlled by mr

contract drilling contract drilling revenues and costs are associated with well drilling and water pump installation  replacement and repair in hawaii 
contract drilling revenues increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  and contract drilling operating expenses increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal operating profit before general and administrative expenses decreased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due to higher drilling costs incurred on certain current contracts 
contract drilling revenues and costs are not seasonal in nature but can fluctuate significantly based on the awarding and timing of contracts  which are determined by contract drilling customer demand 
at september   there was a backlog of seven well drilling contracts and nine pump installation and repair contracts  of which five  four well drilling and one pump installation and repair  were in progress as of september  the backlog of contract drilling revenues as of november  was approximately  approximately two thirds of the contracts in backlog at november  are expected to be completed within fiscal year with the remainder completed in fiscal year contract drilling revenues decreased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  and contract drilling operating expenses decreased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal operating profit before general and administrative expenses decreased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due to a decrease in well drilling work coupled with a decrease in the values and margins of contracts performed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal gas processing and other income gas processing and other income was relatively unchanged increased  or in fiscal as compared to fiscal gas processing and other income increased  to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal the increase was primarily due to a  increase in interest income received from certificates of deposit and cash management funds  gains on sales of other assets of  and a  increase in gas processing revenues during fiscal  as compared to fiscal gain on sale of drill rig barnwell sold a drill rig in fiscal for  net of costs associated with the sale  and recognized a pre tax gain of  there was no such sale in fiscal the drill rig was identical to one of barnwell s other drill rigs and was originally purchased to drill geothermal wells 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal the decrease was principally attributable to i decreased personnel costs of  largely due to decreased bonus expense and incentive compensation costs  ii decreased professional services costs of  primarily related to sarbanes oxley compliance costs incurred in fiscal  and iii increased administrative expense reimbursements from oil and natural gas joint venture partners of  this decrease was partially offset by general inflationary increases 
general and administrative expenses decreased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a  decrease in stock appreciation rights expense for the year ended september  due to fluctuations in barnwell s stock price  partially offset by an increase in the number of shares vested 
this decrease was virtually offset by i increased personnel costs of  ii increased professional services incurred in connection with the preparation for future requirements to comply with the sarbanes oxley act  legal fees related to the land segment  audit fees and actuarial fees for a total of  iii decreased administrative expense reimbursements from oil and natural gas joint venture partners of  and iv an increase in share based compensation of  due to implementation of sfas no 
r during the year ended september  depletion  depreciation and amortization depletion  depreciation and amortization increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  due to a increase in the depletion rate and a increase in the average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar 
the higher depletion rate is due to increases in barnwell s costs of finding and developing proven reserves 
barnwell s cost of finding and developing proven reserves has increased due to the costs of oil and natural gas exploration and development having increased along with product prices and the drilling of unsuccessful wells 
depletion  depreciation and amortization increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  due to a increase in the depletion rate  a increase in production in mcf equivalents where one barrel of oil and natural gas liquids are converted to mcf equivalents and a increase in the average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar 
interest expense interest expense increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  due to higher average loan balances and  to a lesser degree  higher average interest rates during fiscal as compared to fiscal the average interest rate incurred during fiscal on barnwell s borrowings from royal bank of canada increased to  as compared to in fiscal the weighted average balance of outstanding borrowings from royal bank of canada increased to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal the increase was also due in part to interest on borrowings under a  credit facility obtained during the latter half of fiscal on which barnwell incurred interest at an average rate of   of which was capitalized  barnwell did not have such a loan during fiscal interest expense increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  due to higher average interest rates and  to a lesser degree  higher average loan balances during fiscal as compared to fiscal the average interest rate incurred during fiscal on barnwell s borrowings from royal bank of canada increased to  as compared to in fiscal the weighted average balance of outstanding borrowings from royal bank of canada increased to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal interest costs for the fiscal years ended september   and are summarized as follows year ended september  interest costs incurred less interest costs capitalized on residential lots under development interest expense the majority of barnwell s debt is denominated in us dollars 
therefore  the increase in the average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar had a minimal impact on interest expense 
foreign currency fluctuations and other comprehensive income in addition to us operations  barnwell conducts operations in canada 
consequently  barnwell is subject to foreign currency translation and transaction gains and losses due to fluctuations of the exchange rates between the canadian dollar and the us dollar 
the fiscal year average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar increased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and the exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar increased at september   as compared to september  accordingly  the revenues and expenses and assets  liabilities and stockholders equity of barnwell s subsidiaries operating in canada have increased 
barnwell s canadian dollar assets are greater than its canadian dollar liabilities  therefore  increases in value of the canadian dollar to the us dollar generate other comprehensive income 
the fiscal year average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar increased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and the exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar increased at september   as compared to september  other comprehensive income due to foreign currency translation adjustments for fiscal was  a  increase from other comprehensive income of  in fiscal foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material in fiscal  and and are reflected in general and administrative expenses 
the impact of fluctuations of the exchange rates between the canadian dollar and the us dollar may be material from period to period 
barnwell cannot accurately predict future fluctuations between the canadian and us dollars 
income taxes included in the provision for income taxes for fiscal is a canadian deferred tax benefit of  resulting from reductions in canadian tax rates 
also included in the provision for income taxes for fiscal is the recognition of a deferred income tax benefit of  due to a reduction in the valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carryforwards 
the acceleration of barnwell s investments in canadian oil and natural gas properties beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  coupled with kaupulehu developments receipt of proceeds related to increment i  resulted in the determination that it was more likely than not that fiscal and future years taxable income from canadian operations under us tax law would exceed taxable income from canadian operations under canadian tax law to a degree that will result in the utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards to reduce us taxes 
this is primarily attributable to differences in the statutory deduction rates for barnwell s canadian oil and natural gas capital expenditures under canadian tax law as compared to such deductions under us tax law 
there were no reductions in the valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carryforwards in fiscal or a minor reduction in canadian federal tax rates in fiscal resulted in a  reduction in net deferred tax liability in fiscal there was no reduction in canadian tax rates in fiscal in october  the canadian government proposed changes in the corporate tax rate from the current tax rates of    and in calendar years    and  respectively  to    and  respectively

equity in earnings of real estate affiliate in fiscal  barnwell entered into an agreement with nearco  inc nearco  to form mauka k  llc mauka k  for the purpose of providing real estate consulting services and investing in real estate 
barnwell and nearco each have a voting interest in mauka k 
nearco is a company controlled by mr 
terry johnston  a director of barnwell and minority interest owner in certain of barnwell s business ventures 
barnwell does not have a controlling interest in mauka k and thus accounts for its investment utilizing the equity method of accounting

there was no significant activity in mauka k during fiscal environmental matters federal  state  and canadian governmental agencies issue rules and regulations and enforce laws to protect the environment which are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply  particularly in regard to the discharge of materials into the environment 
the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business 
these laws  rules and regulations affect the operations of barnwell and could have a material adverse effect upon the earnings or competitive position of barnwell 
although barnwell s experience has been to the contrary  there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case 
inflation the effect of inflation on barnwell has generally been to increase its cost of operations  interest cost as a substantial portion of barnwell s debt is at variable short term rates of interest which tend to increase as inflation increases  general and administrative costs and direct costs associated with oil and natural gas production and contract drilling operations 
oil and natural gas prices realized by barnwell are essentially determined by world prices for oil and western canadian midwestern us prices for natural gas

this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view our exposures to certain market risks 
commodity price market risk realized pricing of our oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids ngl production is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and north american spot market prices applicable to our canadian natural gas and ngl production
