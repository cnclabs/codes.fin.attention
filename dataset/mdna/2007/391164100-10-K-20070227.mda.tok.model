item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the md a that follows is a combined presentation for great plains energy and consolidated kcp l  both registrants under this filing 
the discussion and analysis by management focuses on those factors that had a material effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the registrants during the periods presented 
great plains energy is a public utility holding company and does not own or operate any significant assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries 
great plains energy s direct subsidiaries with operations or active subsidiaries are kcp l  klt inc  iec and services 
as a diversified energy company  great plains energy s reportable business segments include kcp l and strategic energy 
executive summary great plains energy s earnings were characterized by higher fuel costs  lower prices for wholesale sales and coal conservation in the first half of the year  partially offset by lower purchased power expense and higher retail revenue at kcp l  as well as higher average retail gross margins per mwh without the impact of unrealized fair value gains and losses at strategic energy 
earnings for also reflect the absence of tax benefits experienced at kcp l in and lower delivered volumes at strategic energy 
in  kcp l completed the spearville wind energy facility and received rate orders from the mpsc and kcc 
kcp l began construction of iatan no  continued to make progress on environmental upgrades at existing facilities and implemented customer affordability and efficiency programs 
anticipated acquisition of aquila  inc in february  great plains energy entered into an agreement to acquire aquila 
immediately prior to great plains energy s acquisition of aquila  black hills corporation will acquire aquila s electric utility in colorado and its gas utilities in colorado  kansas  nebraska and iowa plus associated liabilities for a total of million in cash  subject to closing adjustments 
each of the two transactions is conditioned on the completion of the other transaction and is expected to close in management believes the anticipated acquisition will allow great plains energy to expand its operations in a manner consistent with its strategic intent 
great plains energy entered into the transaction agreements with the expectation that the acquisition would result in various benefits to it and kcp l including  among other things  synergies  cost savings and operating efficiencies 
assuming that such efficiencies are achieved and taking into account the anticipated cost of achieving such synergies  the transaction is expected to be modestly dilutive to earnings per share in and accretive beginning in see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
executing on strategic intent kcp l s comprehensive energy plan kcp l continues to make progress in implementing its comprehensive energy plan under orders received from the mpsc and kcc in during  kcp l completed the spearville wind energy facility  a mw wind project in western kansas 
kcp l also entered into certain procurement and engineering agreements for other comprehensive energy plan projects  and further refined its cost estimates and schedules as contracting and engineering progressed 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the comprehensive energy plan estimated capital expenditures by project 
the estimated capital expenditures include prices for labor and materials that reflect current and expected market conditions 
they also include contingencies that reflect  among other things  the currently foreseen risks of those future market conditions as well as risks associated with global sourcing of materials 
the demand for environmental projects has increased substantially  with many utilities in the united states starting similar projects to address changing environmental regulations 
this demand has constrained labor and material resources resulting in a significant escalation in the cost of  and extension of scheduled completion times for  environmental retrofits 
because of the magnitude of the comprehensive energy plan projects and the length of the implementation period  the actual expenditures  scope and timing of any or all of these projects that have not been completed may differ materially from these estimates 
construction of iatan no 
is underway and on schedule for completion in kcp l has approximately of the total estimated cost of the project under firm contracts 
the estimated range of capital expenditures for iatan no 
includes items that are customarily excluded in calculating the installed cost per kw of a generating plant such as rail cars  substation expansion  interconnection upgrades  off site improvements  solid waste landfill and operating spare parts 
excluding these items  the currently estimated installed cost for iatan no 
ranges from approximately  kw to  kw  which kcp l management believes is competitive with other similar projects to be built in the same timeframe 
the first phase of environmental upgrades at lacygne no 
 installation of selective catalytic reduction equipment  began in late and is expected to be in service for the summer of kcp l has almost all of the total estimated cost for the first phase under firm contract 
the second phase of environmental upgrades at lacygne no 
is expected to start design in  and the market conditions noted above could impact the scope and timing 
iatan no 
environmental upgrades are on schedule with approximately of the total estimated costs under firm contract 
in  kcp l implemented several pilot affordability  energy efficiency and demand response programs in missouri and kansas as well as distribution automation system improvements 
results from the implemented pilot programs have demonstrated an ability to manage kcp l s customers retail load requirements and by the end of  kcp l had developed the capability to effect a mw reduction in retail load requirements 
these results are evidenced by the success of kcp l s energy optimizer a residential air conditioning cycling program  mpower a commercial industrial curtailment program and distribution automation investments such as dynamic voltage control 
additionally in  kcc initiated a general investigation into strategies for improving energy efficiency 
the general issues that kcc is investigating relates to when and how utilities should promote energy efficiency by their customers and what ratemaking treatment  including special mechanisms  is appropriate or desirable 
this investigation provides a significant opportunity for the continued development of policies and regulations in kansas designed to promote energy efficiency 
kcp l regulatory proceedings in december  kcp l received rate orders from the mpsc and kcc authorizing annual rate increases of million and million  respectively 
the ordered rates were implemented january  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in february  kcp l filed a request with the mpsc for an annual rate increase of approximately million 
kcp l is required to file a rate request with kcc on march  kcp l business overview kcp l is an integrated  regulated electric utility that engages in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity 
kcp l has over  mws of generating capacity and has transmission and distribution facilities that provide electricity to over  customers in the states of missouri and kansas 
kcp l has continued to experience modest load growth 
load growth consists of higher usage per customer and the addition of new customers 
retail electricity rates are below the national average 
kcp l s residential customers usage is significantly affected by weather 
bulk power sales  the major component of wholesale sales  vary with system requirements  generating unit and purchased power availability  fuel costs and requirements of other electric systems 
less than of revenues include an automatic fuel adjustment provision 
kcp l s coal base load equivalent availability factor was in compared to in kcp l s nuclear unit  wolf creek  accounts for approximately of its base load capacity 
in  wcnoc submitted an application for a new operating license for wolf creek with the nrc  which would extend wolf creek s operating period to the nrc may take up to two years to rule on the application 
wolf creek s most recent refueling outage was in october and lasted days 
the next refueling outage is scheduled to begin in march in  kcp l changed the method of accounting for the wolf creek refueling outage and retrospectively adjusted prior periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the fuel cost per mwh generated and the purchased power cost per mwh have a significant impact on the results of operations for kcp l 
generation fuel mix can substantially change the fuel cost per mwh generated 
nuclear fuel cost per mwh generated is substantially less than the cost of coal per mwh generated  which is significantly lower than the cost of natural gas and oil per mwh generated 
the cost per mwh for purchased power is generally significantly higher than the cost per mwh of coal and nuclear generation 
kcp l continually evaluates its system requirements  the availability of generating units  availability and cost of fuel supply and purchased power  and the requirements of other electric systems to provide reliable power economically 
management expects its cost of nuclear fuel to remain relatively stable through because of contracts in place 
between and  management anticipates the cost of nuclear fuel to increase approximately to due to higher contracted prices and market conditions 
even with this anticipated increase  management expects nuclear fuel cost per mwh generated to remain less than the cost of other fuel sources 
approximately of kcp l s coal requirements come from the prb and are transported on the burlington northern santa fe and the union pacific railroads  both of which had experienced longer cycle times for coal deliveries in and in  kcp l s coal shipments improved significantly  inventory levels improved and kcp l suspended its coal conservation measures implemented in management continues to monitor the situation closely and steps will be taken  as necessary  to maintain an adequate energy supply for kcp l s retail load and firm mwh sales 
however  an inability to obtain timely delivery of coal to meet generation requirements in the future could materially impact kcp l s results of operations by increasing its cost to serve its retail customers and or reducing wholesale mwh sales 
strategic energy business overview great plains energy indirectly owns of strategic energy 
strategic energy does not own any generation  transmission or distribution facilities 
strategic energy provides competitive retail electricity supply services by entering into power supply contracts to supply electricity to its end use customers 
of the states that offer retail choice  strategic energy operates in california  illinois  maryland  massachusetts  michigan  new jersey  new york  ohio  pennsylvania and texas 
strategic energy has begun expansion into connecticut 
in addition to competitive retail electricity supply services  strategic energy also provides strategic planning  consulting and billing and scheduling services in the natural gas and electricity markets 
the cost of supplying electric service to retail customers can vary widely by geographic market 
this variability can be affected by many factors  including  but not limited to  geographic differences in the cost per mwh of purchased power  renewable energy requirements and capacity charges due to regional purchased power availability and requirements of other electricity providers and differences in transmission charges 
strategic energy provides services to approximately  commercial  institutional and small manufacturing accounts for approximately  customers including numerous fortune companies  smaller companies and governmental entities 
strategic energy offers an array of products designed to meet the various requirements of a diverse customer base including fixed price  index based and month to month renewal products 
strategic energy s volume based customer retention rate  excluding month to month customers on market based rates for was 
the corresponding volume based customer retention rates including month to month customers on market based rates was 
retention rates for were lower than strategic energy has experienced in recent years 
the decline is attributable to customer contract expirations in midwestern states where the savings competitive suppliers can offer to customers are limited or in some cases unavailable due to host utility default rates that are not aligned with market prices for power 
in these states  customers can receive lower rates from the host utility and are choosing to return to host utility service as their contracts with strategic energy expire 
management expects to have continued difficulty competing in these states until more competitive market driven pricing mechanisms are in place or market prices for power decrease below host utility rates 
management has focused sales and marketing efforts on states that currently provide a more competitive pricing environment in relation to host utility default rates 
in these states  strategic energy continues to experience improvement in certain key metrics  including strong forecasted future mwh commitments backlog growth and longer contract durations 
as a result  total backlog grew to million mwh at december   compared to million mwh at december  average contract durations grew to months in from months in based solely on expected mwh usage under current signed contracts  strategic energy has backlog of million mwh  million mwh and million mwh for the years through  respectively  and million mwh over the years through strategic energy s projected mwh deliveries for are in the range of to million mwhs 
strategic energy expects to deliver additional mwhs above amounts currently in backlog through new and renewed term contracts and mwh deliveries to month to month customers 
strategic energy currently expects the average retail gross margin per mwh retail revenues less retail purchased power divided by retail mwhs delivered delivered in to average to 
this range excludes unrealized changes in fair value of non hedging energy contracts and from hedge ineffectiveness because management does not predict the future impact of these unrealized changes 
actual retail gross margin per mwh may differ from these estimates 
related party transactions see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding related party transactions 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been used could have a material impact on the results of operations and financial position 
management has identified the following accounting policies deemed critical to the understanding of the companies results of operations and financial position 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
pensions the companies incur significant costs in providing non contributory defined pension benefits 
the costs are measured using actuarial valuations that are dependent upon numerous factors derived from actual plan experience and assumptions of future plan experience 
pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compensation levels and employment periods  the level of contributions made to the plan  earnings on plan assets and plan amendments 
in addition  pension costs are also affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs 
these actuarial assumptions are updated annually at the beginning of the plan year 
in selecting an assumed discount rate  the prevailing market rate of fixed income debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the benefit obligation was considered 
the assumed rate of return on plan assets was developed based on the weighted average of long term returns forecast for the expected portfolio mix of investments held by the plan 
these assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment  however  material changes may occur if these assumptions differ from actual events 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and net costs 
the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a increase or a decrease in key actuarial assumptions 
each sensitivity reflects the impact of the change based on a change in that assumption only 
impact on impact on projected change in benefit pension actuarial assumption assumption obligation expense millions discount rate increase rate of return on plan assets increase discount rate decrease rate of return on plan assets decrease kcp l recorded pension expense reflecting orders from the mpsc and kcc that established annual pension costs at million for and expected pension expense will approximate million after allocations to the other joint owners of generation facilities and capitalized amounts consistent with the december mpsc and kcc rate orders 
the difference between pension costs under sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits and the amount allowed for ratemaking is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability for future ratemaking recovery or refunds  as appropriate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
market conditions and interest rates significantly affect the future assets and liabilities of the plan 
it is difficult to predict future pension costs  changes in pension liability and cash funding requirements due to volatile market conditions 
regulatory matters as a regulated utility  kcp l is subject to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
accordingly  kcp l has recorded assets and liabilities on its balance sheet resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process  which would not otherwise be recorded under gaap 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that are probable of recovery from future revenues 
regulatory liabilities represent amounts imposed by rate actions of kcp l s regulators that may require refunds to customers  represent amounts provided in current rates that are intended to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future for which kcp l remains accountable  or represent a gain or other reduction of allowable costs to be given to customers over future periods 
future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured  but is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness 
future reductions in revenue or refunds for regulatory liabilities generally are not mandated  pending future rate proceedings or actions by the regulators 
management regularly assesses whether regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as decisions by the mpsc  kcc or ferc on kcp l s rate case filings  decisions in other regulatory proceedings  including decisions related to other companies that establish precedent on matters applicable to kcp l  and changes in laws and regulations 
if recovery or refund of regulatory assets or liabilities is not approved by regulators or is no longer deemed probable  these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in the current period results of operations 
kcp l s continued ability to meet the criteria for application of sfas no 
may be affected in the future by restructuring and deregulation in the electric industry 
in the event that sfas no 
no longer applied to a deregulated portion of kcp l s operations  the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism is provided 
additionally  these factors could result in an impairment on utility plant assets as determined pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
energy and energy related contract accounting strategic energy generally purchases power under forward physical delivery contracts to supply electricity to its retail energy customers under full requirement sales contracts 
the full requirements sales contracts and the forward physical delivery contracts meet the accounting definition of a derivative  however  strategic energy applies the normal purchases and normal sales npns exception accounting treatment on full requirement sales contracts 
derivative contracts designated as npns are accounted for by accrual accounting  which requires the effects of the derivative to be recorded when the underlying contract settles 
strategic energy has historically designated the majority of the forward physical delivery contracts as npns  however  as certain markets continue to develop  some derivative instruments may no longer qualify for the npns exception 
as such  strategic energy is designating these forward physical delivery contracts as cash flow hedges  which could result in future increased volatility in derivative assets and liabilities  other comprehensive income oci and net income 
under cash flow hedge accounting  the fair value of the contract is recorded as a current or long term derivative asset or liability 
subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative assets and liabilities are recorded on a net basis in oci and subsequently reclassified to purchased power expense in great plains energy s consolidated statement of income as the power is delivered and or the contract settles 
accordingly  the increase in derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges and the corresponding decrease in derivatives accounted for as npns transactions may affect the timing and nature of accounting recognition  but does not change the underlying economic results 
the fair value of forward purchase derivative contracts that do not meet the requirements for the npns exception or cash flow hedge accounting are recorded as current or long term derivative assets or liabilities 
changes in the fair value of these contracts could result in operating income volatility as changes in the associated derivative assets and liabilities are recorded in purchased power expense in great plains energy s consolidated statement of income 
strategic energy s derivative assets and liabilities consist of a combination of energy and energy related contracts 
while some of these contracts represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources  other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices 
the market prices used to determine fair value reflect management s best estimate considering time  volatility and historical trends 
future market prices may vary from those used in recording energy assets and liabilities at fair value and such variations could be significant 
market prices for energy and energy related commodities vary based upon a number of factors 
changes in market prices will affect the recorded fair value of energy contracts 
changes in the fair value of energy contracts will affect operating income in the period of the change for contracts under fair value accounting and oci in the period of change for contracts under cash flow hedge accounting  while changes in forward market prices related to contracts under accrual accounting will affect operating income in future periods to the extent those prices are realized 
management cannot predict whether  or to what extent  the factors affecting market prices may change  but those changes could be material and could be either favorable or unfavorable 
great plains energy results of operations the following table summarizes great plains energy s comparative results of operations 
as adjusted as adjusted millions operating revenues fuel purchased power skill set realignment costs other operating expenses depreciation and amortization gain loss on property operating income non operating income expenses interest charges income taxes minority interest in subsidiaries loss from equity investments income from continuing operations discontinued operations net income preferred dividends earnings available for common shareholders compared to great plains energy s earnings available for common shareholders decreased to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per share  in a higher average number of common shares  primarily due to the issuance of million shares in may  diluted earnings per share by 
consolidated kcp l s net income increased million in compared to due to increased retail revenues and decreased purchase power expense 
these increases to net income were partially offset by costs related to skill set realignments  increased fuel expense and higher income taxes due to higher pre tax income in and a decrease in income taxes reflecting a reduction in kcp l s deferred tax balances as a result of a reduction in kcp l s composite tax rate 
strategic energy had a net loss of million in compared to net income of million in the net loss was primarily the result of the after tax impact of million in changes in fair value related to non hedging energy contracts and from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness 
additionally  retail mwhs delivered decreased in compared to but the impact to net income was partially offset by higher average retail gross margins per mwh without the impact of unrealized fair value gains and losses 
compared to great plains energy s earnings available for common shareholders decreased to million  or per share  from million  or per share in a higher average number of common shares diluted eps by primarily due to the issuance of million shares in june consolidated kcp l s net income was relatively unchanged in compared to kcp l s net income decreased million primarily due to higher fuel costs and purchased power prices  as well as the effects of plant outages and coal conservation on fuel mix 
higher other operating expenses were partially offset by the regulatory accounting treatment of pension expense 
these decreases to net income were offset by retail revenues increasing as a result of significantly warmer summer weather in compared to an unusually mild summer in additionally  the favorable impact of sustained audit positions on the composite tax rates lowered income taxes 
kcp l s decrease was partially offset by million in reduced losses at hss primarily due to a impairment charge related to the sale of worry free 
strategic energy s net income decreased million in compared to retail mwhs delivered decreased in compared to the average retail gross margin per mwh declined to in the decline in average retail gross margin per mwh in compared to was primarily due to an environment of higher and less volatile energy prices  flat to higher forward electricity prices and seca charges in excess of recoveries 
the negative impacts on average retail gross margin per mwh were partially offset by two significant opportunities to manage retail portfolio load requirements  the favorable reduction of a gross receipts tax contingency and a favorable change in fair value related to non hedging energy contracts and from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness 
strategic energy s income taxes decreased due to lower taxable income partially offset by million in lower tax benefits allocated from the holding company 
higher reductions in affordable housing investments and lower related tax credits decreased other non regulated operations net income in compared to by million 
discontinued operations decreased net income million in compared to  primarily due to a gain on the sale of the majority of the klt gas natural gas properties klt gas portfolio 
this gain was partially offset by losses from the wind down operations and a loss due to the write down of the klt gas portfolio to its estimated net realizable value 
consolidated kcp l results of operations the following discussion of consolidated kcp l results of operations includes kcp l  an integrated  regulated electric utility and hss  an unregulated subsidiary of kcp l

the decrease in average market price per mwh was primarily due to lower gas prices in compared to  as well as the effects on average prices from coal conservation in the region 
additionally  wholesale revenues for include million in litigation recoveries for the loss of use of hawthorn no 
from a boiler explosion 
wholesale revenues decreased million in compared to due to a decrease in mwhs sold  which was significantly offset by an increase in the average market price per mwh 
the decrease in mwhs sold was driven by a decrease in net mwhs generated as a result of coal conservation and plant outages 
additionally  retail mwh sales increased in compared to  which resulted in less mwhs available for wholesale sales

consolidated kcp l fuel and purchased power net mwhs generated by type change change thousands coal nuclear natural gas and oil wind n a total generation fuel expense increased million in compared to due to a increase in mwhs generated  excluding wind generation  which has no fuel cost  increased coal and coal transportation costs and more natural gas generation in the fuel mix  which has higher costs compared to other fuel types 
these increases were partially offset by lower natural gas prices and million in hawthorn no 
litigation recoveries 
kcp l s current coal and coal transportation contracts include higher tariff rates being charged by union pacific 
kcp l has filed a rate case complaint against union pacific with the stb and until the case is finalized  kcp l is paying the tariff rates subject to refund 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
fuel expense increased million in compared to despite a decrease in mwhs generated due to a combination of changes in the fuel mix to higher cost generation  increased coal and coal transportation costs and increased natural gas prices 
the changes in fuel mix were driven by the number and duration of plant outages as well as coal conservation measures 
kcp l s coal and coal transportation contracts were entered into at higher average prices than related contracts 
purchased power expense decreased million in compared to the decreases were primarily due to recording million in hawthorn no 
litigation recoveries as a reduction in purchased power expense and a reduction in mwhs purchased 
the reduction in mwhs purchased was due to uneconomical purchased power prices and increased net mwhs generated 
in addition  capacity payments decreased million in due to the expiration of two large contracts in the second quarter of kcp l entered into new capacity contracts in june purchased power expense increased million in compared to the average price per mwh purchased increased in compared to partially offset by an decline in mwhs purchased 
the increased prices were driven by purchases during higher priced peak hours as a result of warmer weather  plant outages and overall higher average prices due to higher natural gas prices combined with transmission constraints  coal conservation and outages in the region 
consolidated kcp l other operating expenses including other operating  maintenance and general taxes consolidated kcp l s other operating expenses decreased million in compared to primarily due to the following decreased severance and incentive compensation expense of million  decreased restoration expenses of million due to expenses that were incurred for a january ice storm and a june wind storm  deferring million of expenses in accordance with mpsc and kcc orders 
partially offsetting the decrease in other operating expenses was increased maintenance expenses of million for facilities  software and communication equipment and increased property taxes of million primarily due to increases in assessed property valuations and mill levies 
consolidated kcp l s other operating expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to the following increased employee related expenses of million including severance and incentive compensation  increased expenses of million due to higher legal reserves  increased regulatory expenses of million including expenses related to the comprehensive energy plan  increased general taxes of million primarily due to increases in gross receipts tax  assessed property valuations and mill levies  increased expenses of million due to higher restoration costs for a january ice storm and june wind storms compared to the wind storm restoration costs and increased production operations and maintenance expenses of million primarily due to scheduled and forced plant maintenance in and the reversal of an environmental accrual in partially offsetting the increase in other operating expenses was decreased pension expense of million due to the regulatory accounting treatment of pension expense in accordance with mpsc and kcc orders and decreased transmission service expense of million primarily due to lower wholesale mwhs sold 
consolidated kcp l skill set realignment costs in and early  management undertook a process to assess  improve and reposition the skill sets of employees for implementation of the comprehensive energy plan 
kcp l recorded million in related to this workforce realignment process reflecting severance  benefits and related payroll taxes provided by kcp l to employees 
in its rate cases  kcp l is requesting to establish a regulatory asset for these costs and amortize them over five years effective with new rates on january  consolidated kcp l gain loss on property during  kcp l wrote off million of plant operating system development costs at wolf creek as a result of vendor non performance 
in  hss recorded a million impairment charge related to the sale of its subsidiary worry free 
consolidated kcp l interest charges consolidated kcp l s interest charges decreased million in compared to primarily due to million of interest related to the irs audit settlement in consolidated kcp l income taxes consolidated kcp l s income taxes increased million in compared to due to an increase in pre tax income in and a decrease in of million due to the impact of a lower composite tax rate on kcp l s deferred tax balances resulting from the favorable impact of sustained audit positions 
consolidated kcp l s income taxes decreased million in compared to several factors contributed to the decreased taxes including lower taxable income in the favorable impact of sustained audit positions on the composite tax rate decreased income taxes million  including million reflecting a composite tax rate change on deferred tax balances 
the domestic manufacturers deduction provided for under the american jobs creation act of contributed million to the decrease in taxes 
when compared to  these decreases to income taxes were partially offset due to the release of million in tax reserves for the interest component of the irs audit settlement  as discussed under consolidated kcp l interest charges  which resulted in no impact to net income 
strategic energy results of operations the following table summarizes strategic energy s comparative results of operations 
millions operating revenues purchased power other operating expenses depreciation and amortization gain on property operating income loss non operating income expenses interest charges income taxes minority interest in subsidiaries net income loss strategic energy s net loss was primarily the result of the after tax impact of million in changes in fair value related to non hedging energy contracts and from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness 
retail mwhs delivered decreased to million in compared to due to the effect of market conditions in midwestern states and competition in other markets where strategic energy serves customers 
the impact to net income was partially offset by average retail gross margin per mwh without fair value impacts that increased to in compared to in additionally  strategic energy s other operating expenses increased primarily due to increased incentive compensation and bad debt expense 
retail mwhs delivered decreased to million in compared to the average retail gross margin per mwh declined to in the decline in average retail gross margin per mwh in compared to was primarily due to an environment of higher and less volatile energy prices  flat to higher forward electricity prices and million in seca charges in excess of recoveries 
the negative impacts on average retail gross margin per mwh were partially offset by million for two significant opportunities to manage retail portfolio load requirements  a million favorable reduction of a gross receipts tax contingency and an million change in fair value related to non hedging energy contracts and from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness 
average retail gross margin per mwh change in fair value related to non hedging energy contracts and from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness average retail gross margin per mwh without fair value impacts average retail gross margin per mwh without fair value impacts is a non gaap financial measure that differs from gaap because it excludes the impact of unrealized fair value gains or losses 
management and the board of directors use this as a measurement of strategic energy s realized retail gross margin per delivered mwh  which are settled upon delivery at contracted prices 
fair value impacts result from changes in fair value of non hedging energy contracts and from hedge ineffectiveness associated with mwhs under contract but not yet delivered 
due to their non cash nature and volatility during periods prior to delivery  management believes excluding these fair value impacts results in a measure of retail gross margin per mwh that is more representative of contracted prices 
as detailed in the table above  average retail gross margin per mwh without the impact of unrealized fair value gains and losses increased to in compared to in the increase was primarily due to the net impact of seca recoveries and charges as compared to the net seca impact increased average retail gross margin per mwh by in and decreased average retail gross margin per mwh by in additional impacts to the average retail gross margin per mwh included increases primarily due to the management of retail portfolio load requirements  favorable product mix and settlements of supplier contracts 
the increases were partially offset by higher customer acquisition costs in strategic energy purchased power purchased power is the cost component of strategic energy s average retail gross margin 
strategic energy purchases electricity from power suppliers based on forecasted peak demand for its retail customers 
actual customer demand does not always equate to the volume purchased based on forecasted peak demand 
consequently  strategic energy makes short term power purchases in the wholesale market when necessary to meet actual customer requirements 
strategic energy also sells any excess retail electricity supply over actual customer requirements back into the wholesale market 
these sales occur on many contracts  are usually short term power sales day ahead and typically settle within the reporting period 
excess retail electricity supply sales also include long term and short term forward physical sales to wholesale counterparties  which are accounted for on a mark to market basis 
strategic energy typically executes these transactions to manage basis and credit risks 
the proceeds from excess retail supply sales are recorded as a reduction of purchased power  as they do not represent the quantity of electricity consumed by strategic energy s customers 
the amount of excess retail supply sales that reduced purchased power was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
additionally  in certain markets  strategic energy is required to sell to and purchase power from a rto iso rather than directly transact with suppliers and end use customers 
the sale and purchase activity related to these certain rto iso markets is reflected on a net basis in strategic energy s purchased power 
strategic energy utilizes derivative instruments  including forward physical delivery contracts  in the procurement of electricity 
purchased power is also impacted by the net change in fair value related to non hedging energy contracts and from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness 
net changes in fair value increased purchased power expenses by million in and reduced expenses by million in and million in the change is a result of decreases in the forward market prices for power combined with strategic energy designating more derivative instruments as cash flow hedges that no longer qualify for the npns election 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
strategic energy other operating expenses strategic energy s other operating expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to a million increase for incentive compensation and a million increase in bad debt expense due to the charge off of smaller customers  which have a higher default rate than strategic energy s larger customers

see item a 
risk factors and item 
md a for further discussion of the companies risk factors 
great plains energy and consolidated kcp l are exposed to market risks associated with commodity price and supply  interest rates and equity prices 
management has established risk management policies and strategies to reduce the potentially adverse effects the volatility of the markets may have on its operating results 
during the normal course of business  under the direction and control of internal risk management committees  the companies hedging strategies are reviewed to determine the hedging approach deemed appropriate based upon the circumstances of each situation 
though management believes its risk management practices to be effective  it is not possible to identify and eliminate all risk 
the companies could experience losses  which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position  due to many factors  including unexpectedly large or rapid movements or disruptions in the energy markets  from regulatory driven market rule changes and or bankruptcy or non performance of customers or counterparties 
derivative instruments are frequently utilized to execute risk management and hedging strategies 
derivative instruments  such as futures  forward contracts  swaps or options  derive their value from underlying assets  indices  reference rates or a combination of these factors 
these derivative instruments include negotiated contracts  which are referred to as over the counter derivatives and instruments listed and traded on an exchange 
the companies maintain commodity price risk management strategies that use derivative instruments to minimize significant  unanticipated net income fluctuations caused by commodity price volatility 
interest rate risk great plains energy and consolidated kcp l manage interest expense and short and long term liquidity through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
generally  the amount of each type of debt is managed through market issuance  but interest rate swap and cap agreements with highly rated financial institutions may also be used to achieve the desired combination 
using outstanding balances and annualized interest rates as of december   a hypothetical increase in the interest rates associated with long term variable rate debt would result in an increase of million in interest expense for additionally  interest rates impact the fair value of long term debt 
kcp l had million of commercial paper outstanding at december  the principal amount  which will vary during the year  of the commercial paper will drive kcp l s commercial paper interest expense 
assuming that million of commercial paper was outstanding for all of  a hypothetical increase in commercial paper rates would result in an increase of million in interest expense for a change in interest rates would impact the company to the extent it redeemed any of its outstanding long term debt 
great plains energy s and consolidated kcp l s book values of long term debt were below fair values at december  commodity risk kcp l and strategic energy engage in the wholesale and retail marketing of electricity and are exposed to risk associated with the price of electricity 
kcp l s wholesale operations include the physical delivery and marketing of power obtained through its generation capacity and long  intermediate and short term capacity or power purchase agreements 
the agreements contain penalties for non performance to limit kcp l s energy price risk on the contracted energy 
kcp l also enters into additional power purchase agreements with the objective of obtaining the most economical energy to meet its physical delivery obligations to customers 
kcp l is required to maintain a capacity margin of at least of its peak summer demand 
this net positive supply of capacity and energy is maintained through its generation assets and capacity and power purchase agreements to protect it from the potential operational failure of one of its power generating units 
kcp l continually evaluates the need for additional risk mitigation measures in order to minimize its financial exposure to  among other things  spikes in wholesale power prices during periods of high demand 
kcp l s sales include the sales of electricity to its retail customers and bulk power sales of electricity in the wholesale market 
kcp l continually evaluates its system requirements  the availability of generating units  availability and cost of fuel supply  the availability and cost of purchased power and the requirements of other electric systems  therefore  the impact of the hypothetical amounts that follow could be significantly reduced depending on the system requirements and market prices at the time of the increases 
a hypothetical increase in the market price of power could result in a million decrease in operating income for related to purchased power 
in  approximately of kcp l s net mwhs generated are expected to be coal fired 
kcp l currently has all of its coal requirements for under contract 
a hypothetical increase in the market price of coal could result in less than a million increase in fuel expense for kcp l has also implemented price risk mitigation measures to reduce its exposure to high natural gas prices 
a hypothetical increase in natural gas and oil market prices could result in an increase of million in fuel expense for at december   kcp l had hedged approximately and of its and  respectively  projected natural gas usage for generation requirements to serve retail load and firm mwh sales 
kcp l did not have any of its projected natural gas usage for generation requirements to serve retail load and firm mwh sales hedged at december  strategic energy maintains a commodity price risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments including forward physical energy purchases  to minimize significant  unanticipated net income fluctuations caused by commodity price volatility 
in certain markets where strategic energy operates  entering into forward fixed price contracts is cost prohibitive 
financial derivative instruments  including swaps  are used to limit the unfavorable effect that price increases will have on electricity purchases  effectively fixing the future purchase price of electricity for the applicable forecasted usage and protecting strategic energy from significant price volatility 
a hypothetical increase in the market price of purchased power could result in a million increase in purchased power expense for strategic energy has historically utilized certain derivative instruments to protect against significant price volatility for purchased power that have qualified for the npns exception  in accordance with sfas no 
 as amended 
however  as certain markets continue to develop  some derivative instruments may no longer qualify for the npns exception 
as such  strategic energy is designating these derivative instruments as cash flow hedges  where appropriate  which could result in future increased volatility in derivative assets and liabilities  oci and net income above levels historically experienced 
derivative instruments that were designated as npns are accounted for by accrual accounting  which requires the effects of the derivative to be recorded when the derivative contract settles 
accordingly  the increase in derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges  and the corresponding decrease in derivatives accounted for as npns transactions  may affect the timing and nature of accounting recognition  but does not change the underlying economics of the transactions 
investment risk kcp l maintains trust funds  as required by the nrc  to fund its share of decommissioning the wolf creek nuclear power plant 
as of december   these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity securities and fixed income securities and are reflected at fair value on kcp l s balance sheets 
the mix of securities is designed to provide returns to be used to fund decommissioning and to compensate for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs  however  the equity securities in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and the value of fixed rate fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates resulting in a hypothetical decrease in the value of the fixed income securities would have resulted in a million reduction in the value of the decommissioning trust funds at december  a hypothetical decrease in equity prices would have resulted in a million reduction in the fair value of the equity securities at december  kcp l s exposure to investment risk associated with the decommissioning trust funds is in large part mitigated due to the fact that kcp l is currently allowed to recover its decommissioning costs in its rates 
klt investments has affordable housing notes that require the greater of of the outstanding note balances or the next annual installment to be held as cash  cash equivalents or marketable securities 
a hypothetical decrease in market prices of the securities held as collateral would have an insignificant impact on pre tax net income for
