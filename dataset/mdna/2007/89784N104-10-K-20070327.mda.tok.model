critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap used in the united states 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
we believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our consolidated financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financials 
inventory is valued at the average cost method 
under the average cost method  it is assumed that the cost of inventory is based on the average cost of the goods available for sale during the period 
average cost is computed by dividing the total cost of goods available for sale by the total units available for sale 
this gives a weighted average unit cost that is applied to the units in the ending inventory 
market value of non current inventory is estimated based on historical sales trends for this category of inventory of the company s individual product lines  the impact of market trends  an evaluation of economic conditions and the value of current orders relating to the future sales of this type of inventory 
at december   inventory consisted of finished goods and work in process

 accounting for income taxes 
fin requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than fifty percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
upon adoption  the cumulative effect of applying the recognition and measurement provisions of fin  if any  shall be reflected as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
fin requires that subsequent to initial adoption a change in judgment that results in subsequent recognition  derecognition or change in a measurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period including any related interest and penalties be recognized as a discrete item in the period in which the change occurs 
currently  we record such changes in judgment  including audit settlements  as a component of our income tax provision 
thus  our reported quarterly income tax rate may become more volatile upon adoption of fin this change will not impact the manner in which we record income tax expense on an annual basis 
fin also requires expanded disclosures including identification of tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next twelve months  a description of tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdiction  a tabular reconciliation of the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning and end of each annual reporting period  the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate and the total amounts of interest and penalties recognized in the statements of operations and financial position
