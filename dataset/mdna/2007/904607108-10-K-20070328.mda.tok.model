revenue and income generation the company receives its revenue primarily from earned premium derived from the insurance company operations  commission and fee income generated from the insurance agency operations  finance charges and fee income from the premium finance operations  and investment income from cash generated primarily from the insurance company operation 
the insurance company operation generates approximately of the company s total revenue 
the company s remaining operations constitute a variety of specialty insurance services  each with unique characteristics and individually not material to consolidated revenues 
insurance company operation the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive and includes many insurers  ranging from large companies offering a wide variety of products worldwide to smaller  specialized companies in a single state or region offering only a single product 
many of the company s existing or potential competitors have considerably greater financial and other resources  have a higher rating assigned by independent rating organizations such as am best company  have greater experience in the insurance industry and offer a broader line of insurance products than the company 
crusader is writing primarily commercial multiple peril business only in the state of california 
crusader s financial strength rating has been upgraded by am best company from b good to b good  effective january   with a rating outlook of stable 
a primary challenge of the property and casualty insurance company operation is contending with the fact that the company sells its products before the ultimate costs are actually known 
that is  when pricing its products  the company must forecast the ultimate claim and loss adjustment costs 
in addition  factors such as changes in regulations and legal environment  among other things  can all impact the accuracy of such cost forecasts 
the property and casualty insurance industry is characterized by periods of soft market conditions  in which premium rates are stable or falling and insurance is readily available  and by periods of hard market conditions  in which premium rates rise  coverage may be more difficult to find and insurers profits increase 
the company believes that the california property and casualty insurance market has transitioned to a soft market in the last few years the company cannot determine how long the existing market conditions will continue  nor in which direction they might change 
despite the increased competition in the property and casualty marketplace  the company believes that rate adequacy is more important than premium growth  and that underwriting profit net earned premium less losses and loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition costs is its primary goal 
for the year ended december   gross written premium was  a decrease of  compared to for the twelve months ended december   losses and loss adjustment expenses for insured events of the current year were  offset by  of favorable development for events of prior years 
for the twelve months ended december   losses and loss adjustment expenses for insured events of the current year were  offset by  of favorable development for events of prior years 
the favorable developments resulted from settling or re estimating claims for lesser amounts than they were previously forecast 
other operations the company s other operations generate commissions  fees  and finance charges from various insurance products 
the events that have the most significant economic impact are as follows unifax primarily sells and services insurance policies for crusader 
the commissions paid by crusader to unifax are eliminated as intercompany transactions and are not reflected as income in the financial statements 
policy fee income for the twelve months ended december   decreased as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in policy fee income is a result of a decrease in the number of policies issued during the twelve months ended december   as compared to  offset in part by an approximate increase in the policy fee for policies effective on or after june  aaqhc provides various consumer benefits to its members  including participation in group health care and life insurance policies 
for these services  aaqhc receives membership and fee income from its members 
membership and fee income decreased in the year ended december   compared to the decrease is a result of the decrease in the number of members 
in may  cigna healthcare began offering new small group medical insurance policies in the state of california 
currently  all new cigna small group medical insurance policies are written through aib and all cigna small group medical insurance policyholders are members of aaqhc 
the new programs are competitively priced and are being actively marketed 
aib sells and services health insurance policies for individual family and small business groups and receives commissions based on the premiums that it writes 
commissions remained relatively comparable in the year ended december   compared to aac provides premium financing for crusader policies that are produced by unifax in california 
finance charges and fees earned by aac during decreased as compared to the decrease is primarily a result of a decrease in the number of loans issued in compared to average premium financed increased to  in from  in the daily automobile rental insurance program is produced by bedford insurance services  inc bedford receives a commission from a non affiliated insurance company based on premium written 
commission in the daily automobile rental insurance program decreased  as compared to the decrease is due to the continued intense competition in the daily automobile rental insurance program 
bedford continues to produce business only at rates that it believes are adequate 
primarily due to declining sales  in april bedford hired a new general manager who has substantial experience in the daily automobile rental insurance business 
future sales growth of the bedford program is also currently dependent upon the non affiliated insurance company approving and implementing various product enhancements that bedford recommends 
bedford is currently working with the non affiliated insurance company to obtain their approval of the recommended program enhancements 
investments and liquidity the company generates revenue from its investment portfolio  which consisted of approximately million at amortized cost at december   compared to million at amortized cost at december  investment income for the twelve months ended december   increased million or in compared to the increase was primarily due to both an increase in invested assets of approximately million and an increase in the company s annualized yield on average invested assets from in to in the increase in the annualized yield on average invested assets is a result of higher yields in the marketplace on both new and reinvested assets 
due to the current interest rate environment  management believes it is prudent to purchase fixed maturity investments with maturities of five years or less and with minimal credit risk 
as of december   the weighted average maturity of the company s fixed maturity investments was years compared to years and years as of december   and december   respectively 
liquidity and capital resources due to the nature of the company s business insurance and insurance services and whereas company growth does not normally require material reinvestments of profits into property or equipment  the cash flow generated from operations usually results in improved liquidity for the company 
because the company is a holding company and operates through its subsidiaries  its cash flow is dependent upon the earnings of its subsidiaries and the distributions of those earnings to the company 
the cash flow provided by operations in the year ended december   was  a decrease in cash flow of  compared to the cash flow for the year ending december  cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december   was  a decrease of  in cash provided compared to the year ended december  the company has utilized the cash provided from operating activities and from the maturity of its fixed maturity investments primarily to purchase million of fixed maturity securities in the most significant liquidity risk faced by the company is adverse development of the insurance company s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
based on the company s current loss and loss expense reserves and expected current and future payments  the company believes that there are no current liquidity issues 
however  no assurance can be given that the company s estimate of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense reserves will be sufficient 
crusader generates a significant amount of cash as a result of its holdings of unearned premium reserves  its reserves for loss payments  and its capital and surplus 
crusader s loss and loss adjustment expense payments are the most significant cash flow requirement of the company 
these payments are continually monitored and projected to ensure that the company has the liquidity to cover these payments without the need to liquidate its investments

the company cannot determine how long the existing market condition will continue  nor in which direction it might change 
the company s future writings and growth are dependent on market conditions  competition  and upon the company s ability to introduce new marketing channels and profitable products 
the company continues to believe that it can compete effectively and profitably by offering better service and by focusing its marketing efforts upon independent agents 
historically  most of crusader s marketing was aimed at independent insurance brokers  representatives of the consumer 
with the relatively recent advent of heightened competition and of declining sales  in crusader adopted a plan to supplement its marketing efforts with independent agents  representatives of the company 
the company believes that those agents will be particularly effective and that their efforts will not diminish the business historically produced by independent brokers 
crusader expects to begin making those agency appointments during the company writes annual policies and  therefore  earns written premium daily over the one year policy term

accident years through has substantially the same expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio 
the company s emerging loss and loss adjustment expense ratios for each accident year are reviewed in detail at the end of each quarter as part of the reserve diagnostics testing 
the combined ratio is the sum of the net ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred including a provision for incurred but not reported losses ibnr to net premiums earned loss ratio and the ratio of policy acquisition costs to net premiums earned expense ratio 
the following table shows the loss ratios  expense ratios  and combined ratios of crusader as derived from data prepared in accordance with gaap 
year ended december loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio as indicated in the above table  the loss ratio for the year ended december   decreased to from in and in the continuous decrease in the loss ratio was primarily due to improvements in the provision for prior years incurred losses

del prior to    total prior accident years  del 
as reflected in the above table  the increase in the favorable development for the year ended december  is primarily due to a substantial decrease in the provision for losses and loss adjustment expenses for accident year during the calendar year this favorable development arose from the lower than expected emergence of losses during relative to expectations used to establish our loss reserves at the end of and the severity of late reported property and casualty claims that emerged during was lower than expected and case development on previously reported claims was better than expected 
during the fourth quarter of the company determined that the favorable development of accident year  which developed during  was sufficient to warrant a reduction in the ultimate expected losses and loss adjustment expenses for that accident year 
during the first three quarters of  the company determined that the development during that period was not sufficient to warrant reducing accident year reserves further than previously recorded 
because the incidence of the cmp losses is subject to a considerable element of fortuity  reserve estimates for this line are based on an analysis of past loss experience on average over a period of years 
as a result  the favorable development recognized in had a minimal effect on our determination of carried cmp loss reserves at december  the adjustment of prior accident year reserves discussed above is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods 
any reduction in losses and loss adjustment expenses from redundancies in the company s december   reserves over actual future payments  and or any additional losses and loss adjustment expenses from actual future payments that exceed the company s reserves  will be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations of future accounting periods 
the company s current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio assumption closely approximates the company s historical average loss and loss adjustment expense ratio 
a difference between the company s current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio assumption and the actual loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for a given accident year will ultimately result in a dollar change either higher or lower that is a multiple of the earned premium for that year 
the actual loss and loss adjustment expense ratio has been within five percentage points of the current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in four of the company s twenty two years 
since the company s net earned premium in was  a difference between the accident year actual and current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratios of only five percentage points will ultimately impact losses and loss adjustment expenses by  the actual loss and loss adjustment expense ratio has been within ten percentage points of the current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in nine of the company s twenty two years 
a difference of ten percentage points on accident year will ultimately impact losses and loss adjustment expenses by  the actual loss and loss adjustment expense ratio has been within twenty percentage points of the current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in fifteen of the company s twenty two years 
a twenty percentage point difference between the accident year actual and the current expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratios will ultimately impact losses and loss adjustment expenses by  in addition  accident years and prior are still developing 
future development on those years might either offset or add to any future development that emerges on accident year reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses the company s liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves consists of case reserves and reserves for incurred but not reported ibnr claims 
case reserves are established by claims personnel based on a review of the facts known at the time the claim is reported and are subsequently revised as more information about a claim becomes known 
ibnr is computed using various actuarial methods and techniques and includes reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses on claims that have occurred but for which claims have not yet been reported to the company  and a provision for expected future development on case reserves for information not currently known

the company s net loss and loss adjustment expense reserve was  as of december  since underwriting profit is a significant part of income  a small percentage change in reserve estimates may result in a substantial effect on future reported earnings 
such changes might result from a variety of factors  including claims costs emerging in a different pattern than the average historical development patterns 
considering the continuum of possible development patterns  none of which is necessarily more or less likely than the next  one must consider the varying probabilities that the development pattern is off in varying degrees 
if future development ultimately ends up being five percent different than the company s reserve  approximately million would be reflected in future periods as an increase or decrease in the provision for events of prior years and would be recognized in the company s consolidated statement of operations in future periods 
a variance of five percent of net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves is not an unlikely scenario 
similarly  a variance of ten percent of the company s reserves would be reflected in approximately million in future periods as an increase or decrease in the provision for events of prior years and would be recognized in the company s consolidated statements of operations in future periods 
this is also not an unlikely scenario 
differences of more than ten percent are also possible  though not quite as likely as differences of ten percent or less

the fixed maturity investments with a gross unrealized loss position for a continuous period over months consisted of us treasury securities  investment grade industrial securities and pre refunded municipal bonds 
the unrealized loss is primarily due to rising interest rates 
the company monitors its investments closely 
if an unrealized loss is determined to be other than temporary  it is written off as a realized loss through the consolidated statements of operations 
the company s methodology of assessing other than temporary impairments is based on security specific analysis as of the balance sheet date and considers various factors including the length of time to maturity and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost  the financial condition and the near term prospects of the issuer  whether the debtor is current on its contractually obligated interest and principal payments  and the company s intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow the company to recover its costs 
the company has concluded that the gross unrealized losses of  at december   were temporary in nature

in the year ended december   the company recognized an income tax expense of  resulting from an assessment for the years and from the california franchise tax board 
the assessment resulted from a court ruling in ceridian vs 
franchise tax board that held that the california statute permitting the tax deductibility of dividends received from a wholly owned insurance subsidiary was unconstitutional because it discriminated against out of state holding companies and thus was in violation of the interstate commerce clause of the united states constitution 
the ruling concluded that the discriminatory sections of the statute are not severable and the entire statute was invalid and unenforceable 
california law provides that the proper remedy in such circumstances is to disallow the deduction to those taxpayers that benefited from the deduction 
as a result of the court ruling  in february  the franchise tax board ftb notified the company that it would issue a notice of proposed assessment npa for tax years and of approximately  representing california state franchise taxes plus related interest of approximately  in september  california enacted legislation ab that addresses many aspects of the tax treatment of insurance company owners  including holding companies such as unico 
the legislation provides for an election  applicable if made to all tax years ending after december   and before january   under which a dividend received deduction of up to of dividends paid by an insurer to a non insurer parent is allowed

significant accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while every effort is made to ensure the integrity of such estimates  actual results could differ 
management believes the company s current critical accounting policies comprise the following losses and loss adjustment expenses the preparation of the company s financial statements requires judgments and estimates 
the most significant is the estimate of loss reserves as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
management makes its best estimate of the liability for unpaid claims costs as of the end of each fiscal quarter 
due to the inherent uncertainties in estimating the company s unpaid claims costs  actual loss and loss adjustment expense payments should be expected to vary  perhaps significantly  from any estimate made prior to the settling of all claims 
variability is inherent in establishing loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  especially for a small insurer like the company 
for any given line of insurance  accident year  or other group of claims  there is a continuum of possible reserve estimates  each having its own unique degree of propriety or reasonableness 
due to the complexity and nature of the insurance claims process  there are potentially an infinite number of reasonably likely scenarios 
the company does not specifically identify reasonably likely scenarios other than utilizing management s best estimate 
in addition to applying the various standard methods to the data  an extensive series of diagnostic tests of the resultant reserve estimates are applied to determine management s best estimate of the unpaid claims liability 
among the statistics reviewed for each accident year are loss and loss adjustment expense development patterns  frequencies expected claim counts  severities average cost per claim  loss and loss adjustment expense ratios to premium  and loss adjustment expense ratios to loss 
when there is clear evidence that the actual claims costs emerged are different than expected for any prior accident year  the claims cost estimates for that year are revised accordingly 
some lines of insurance are commonly referred to as long tail lines because of the extended time required before claims are ultimately settled 
lines of insurance in which claims are settled relatively quickly are called short tail lines 
it is generally more difficult to estimate loss reserves for long tail lines because of the long period that elapses between the occurrence of a claim and its final disposition and the difficulty of estimating the settlement value of the claim 
the company s short tail lines consist of its property coverages and its long tail lines consist of its liability coverages 
however  compared to other long tail liability lines that are not underwritten by the company  such as workers compensation  professional liability  umbrella liability  and medical malpractice  the company s liability claims tend to be settled relatively quicker 
the company underwrites four statutory annual statement lines of business commercial multiple peril  liability other than automobile and products  fire  and allied lines 
commercial multiple peril policies comprised of the company s and premium volume 
commercial multiple peril policies include both property and liability coverages 
for all of the company s coverages and lines of business  the company s actuarial loss and loss adjustment expense reserving methods require assumptions that can be grouped into two key categories expected loss and loss adjustment expense  required by the expected loss ratio and bornhuetter ferguson methods  and expected development patterns  required by the loss development and bornhuetter ferguson methods 
the company also segregates most of its business into smaller homogeneous categories primarily for management s internal detailed business review and analysis 
these homogeneous categories used by the company include various combinations and special groupings of its lines of business  programs types  states  and coverages 
some categories exclude certain items and or others include certain items 
not all categories are defined in the same way 
this analysis includes the tracking of historical claims costs and development patterns separately for each of these uniquely designed categories 
generally  neither the liability development patterns nor the property development patterns vary significantly by category 
the accurate establishment of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves is a difficult process  as there are many factors that can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and  therefore  the reserve that is needed 
estimates are based on a variety of industry data and on the company s current and historical accident year claims data  including but not limited to reported claim counts  open claim counts  closed claim counts  closed claim counts with payments  paid losses  paid loss adjustment expenses  case loss reserves  case loss adjustment expense reserves  earned premiums and policy exposures  salvage and subrogation  and unallocated loss adjustment expenses paid 
many other factors  including changes in reinsurance  changes in pricing  changes in policy forms and coverage  changes in underwriting and risk selection  legislative changes  results of litigation and inflation are also taken into account 
at the end of each fiscal quarter  the company s reserves are re evaluated for each accident year ie  for all claims incurred within each year by a committee consisting of the company s executive vice president  the company s chief financial officer  and an independent consulting actuary 
the company uses the loss ratio method to estimate ultimate claims costs on the current accident year 
the current accident year ibnr reserves are initially determined by multiplying earned premiums for the year by the expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio  then subtracting the current accident year s cumulative incurred paid plus case reserves to date 
this method is subject to adjustment based upon actual results incurred during the reporting period 
this initial ibnr reserve is adjusted as subsequent development of that accident year takes place 
the company also applies several additional standard actuarial methods to the historical claims costs data to estimate its unpaid claims liability for each accident year 
the additional standard methods include loss development methods and bornhuetter ferguson methods  both of which can be applied to paid loss and loss adjustment expense claims costs  reported incurred paid plus case reserve claims costs  and or claim counts 
these methodologies do not vary by tail length  however  certain parameters do vary 
in particular  loss development factors for short tail property claims are different than for long tail liability claims 
development patterns generally do not tend to change materially over time 
generally  the company has very little property claim development subsequent to the end of an accident year 
although liability claims may take or more years to fully develop  most of the development occurs in the first five to six years subsequent to the end of the accident year 
however  liability claims are substantially developed by two years subsequent to the end of the accident year 
other than the change in the expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratio assumption discussed above  the company s reserving methodology assumptions have not changed in the years presented and the only significant effect on the company s financial statements has resulted from estimated costs being adjusted as actual costs emerge 
the company s actuarially based loss and loss adjustment expense reserve methodology does not include an implicit or explicit provision for uncertainty 
insurance claims costs are inherently uncertain 
there is not a precise means of quantifying a provision for uncertainty when determining an appropriate liability for unpaid claims costs 
rather  the potential for claims costs being less than estimated and the potential for claims costs being more than estimated are considered when selecting the parameters to be used in the application of the actuarial methods and when testing the estimates for reasonableness 
management believes that its recorded loss and loss adjustment expense reserve makes reasonable provision for its liability for unpaid claims costs 
the information that management uses to arrive at its best reserve estimate comes from many sources within the company  including its accounting  legal  claims  and underwriting departments 
informed managerial judgment is applied throughout the reserving process 
in addition  time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim  the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be 
accordingly  short tail claims  such as property damage claims  tend to be more reasonably predictable than long tail liability claims 
the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is based upon the accumulation of individual case estimates for losses reported prior to the close of the accounting period plus estimates based on experience and industry data for development of case estimates and for unreported losses and loss adjustment expenses 
since the emergence and disposition of claims are subject to uncertainties  the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle claims may vary significantly from the estimated amounts provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
any adjustments to reserves are reflected in the operating results of the periods in which they are made 
management believes that the aggregate reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are reasonable and adequate to cover the cost of claims  both reported and unreported 
the company must estimate its ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses using a very small claim population size 
at the beginning of  the company had open claim files 
during   new claim files were opened and  claim files were closed  leaving open claim files at the end of due to the small size of the company and the related small population of claims  the company s losses and loss adjustment expenses for any accident year can vary significantly from the initial expectations 
due to the small number of claims  changes in claim frequency and or severity can materially affect the company s reserve estimate 
the potential variability from management s best estimate cannot be measured from any meaningful statistical basis due to the numerous uncertainties in the claims reserving process and the small population of claims 
at each quarterly review  actual claims costs that emerge are compared with the claims costs that were expected to emerge during that development period 
sometimes the previous claims costs estimates prove to have been too high  sometimes they prove to have been too low 
in the case of the company  the estimates proved to be too high in each of the past three years 
the favorable development in through underscores the inherent uncertainty in insurance claims costs  especially for a very small insurer

del net reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at beginning of year    net decrease in provision for events of prior years    percent of development to beginning reserves del 
the differences between actual and expected claims costs are typically not due to one specific factor  but a combination of many factors such as the period of time between the initial occurrence and the final settlement of the claim  current and perceived social and economic inflation  and many other economic  legal  political  and social factors 
because of these and other factors  actual loss and loss adjustment expense payments should be expected to vary  perhaps significantly  from any estimate made prior to the settling of all claims 
any adjustments to reserves are reflected in the operating results of the periods in which they are made 
management believes that the aggregate reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are reasonable and adequate to cover the cost of claims  both reported and unreported 
reinsurance the company s receivable from reinsurers represents an estimate of the amount of future loss and loss adjustment expense payments that will be recoverable from the company s reinsurers 
these estimates are based upon estimates of the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses that the company expects to incur and the portion of those losses that are expected to be allocable to reinsurers based upon the terms of the reinsurance agreements 
given the uncertainty of the ultimate amounts of losses and loss adjustment expenses  the estimates may vary significantly from the eventual outcome 
the company s estimate of the amounts receivable from reinsurers is regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
the company s assessment of the collectibility of the recorded amounts receivable from reinsurers is based primarily upon public financial statements and rating agency data 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in then current operations 
we evaluate each of our ceded reinsurance contracts at their inception to determine if there is sufficient risk transfer to allow the contract to be accounted for as reinsurance under current accounting literature

the company s reinsurance strategy is to reduce volatility in its expected loss and loss adjustment expense results by protecting the company against liabilities in excess of certain retentions  including major or catastrophic losses that may occur from any one or more of the property and or casualty risks which it insures 
on an annual basis  or sooner if warranted  the company evaluates whether any changes to its retention  participation  or retained limits are necessary 
the most significant change to the company s reinsurance program during the three years ended december   was increasing its catastrophic reinsurance in from million to million 
the company currently only writes business in the state of california 
the types of businesses and the coverage limits written by the company are not considered difficult lines for obtaining reinsurance 
in addition  because the major catastrophe exposure is primarily from riots and fire following earthquakes  the company does not anticipate significant limitations on its ability to cede future losses on a basis consistent with its historical results 
investments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the company is required to classify its investments in debt and equity securities into one of three categories held to maturity  available for sale or trading securities 
the company s fixed maturity investments are classified as available for sale and are stated at market value 
although all of the company s investments are classified as available for sale and the company may sell investment securities from time to time in response to economic and market conditions  its investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding high quality investments to maturity 
short term investments are carried at cost  which approximates market value 
investments in equity securities are carried at market value 
the unrealized gains or losses from fixed maturities and equity securities are reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which is a separate component of stockholders equity  net of any deferred tax effect 
when a decline in value of a fixed maturity or equity security is considered other than temporary  a loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
realized gains and losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations based on the specific identification method

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of invested assets whose fair values are subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the company s invested assets at december  and consisted of the following fixed maturity bonds at amortized cost   short term cash investments at cost   certificates of deposit over year at cost   total invested assets   the company s interest rate risk is primarily in its fixed maturity bond portfolio 
as market interest rates decrease  the value of the portfolio increases with the opposite holding true in rising interest rate environments 
in addition  the longer the maturity  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
the company limits this risk by investing in securities with maturities no greater than eight years 
in addition  although fixed maturity bonds are classified as available for sale  the company s investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding high quality bonds to maturity 
because fixed maturity bonds are primarily held to maturity  the change in the market value of these bonds resulting from interest rate movements is unrealized and no gains or losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
unrealized gains and losses are reported as separate components of stockholders equity  net of any deferred tax effect 
as of december   the company s unrealized losses net of unrealized gains before income taxes on its fixed maturity bond portfolio were  compared to unrealized losses net of unrealized gains before income taxes of  as of december  given a hypothetical parallel increase of basis points in interest rates  the fair value of the fixed maturity bond portfolio as of december   would decrease by approximately  this decrease would not be reflected in the statements of operations except to the extent that the securities were sold 
the company s short term investments and certificates of deposit have only minimal interest rate risk
