item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
generally  we charge our pay television distributors a monthly subscriber fee for the right to broadcast our channels 
generally  these distribution agreements last from three to ten years  and sometimes include annual increases of subscriber fees 
a distribution agreement may also involve a payment by us for the establishment of the relationship or  together with or in lieu of any payment  waived subscriber fees for our channels to distributors for a period of time and discounts or no fees if certain subscriber levels are achieved 
please see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for information regarding subscriber fees 
for the years ended december    and revenue derived from subscriber fees for the channels were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
advertising revenue television advertising is sold in a variety of formats 
many pay television channels rely largely upon the spot advertisement format 
spot advertisements are normally seconds long and air during or between programs 
they are often sold in packages of a certain number of spots or to deliver a certain number of viewers 
an alternative to spot advertising is sponsorship  by which a company sponsors a program or selection of programs on a channel and receives enhanced exposure for its brand and products in these programs 
the ability of a television channel to generate advertising revenue largely depends on estimated or actual viewing levels  primarily based on ratings  and on advertising rates 
in the united states  independent ratings systems on which advertising sales can be based are well established and widely accepted within the industry 
in addition  pay television channel providers and distributors may also provide estimated or actual subscriber information 
our channel typically sells approximately of its advertising in the up front season  generally in june and july  for the last quarter of the same year and the first three quarters of the following year 
we hold back a small percentage of our inventory for audience deficiency units  adus  and sell the remainder in the spot or scatter market 
adus are units of inventory that are made available to advertisers as compensation for advertising purchased in programs which did not deliver the ratings which the advertisers had been guaranteed 
as pay television channels draw audience share  audience demographics ie viewers categorized by characteristics such as age  sex and income become fragmented 
as a result  advertisers are able to target the specific groups of viewers who are most likely to purchase their products  by buying advertising on channels which attract the desired viewer demographic 
we have advertising sales offices in new york  los angeles  chicago  and atlanta 
in addition  we have made significant investments in programming  research  marketing and promotions  all specifically designed to support the sale of advertising time on our channels 
for the years ended december    and revenues from the sale of advertising time on our channels were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
ratings among the ad supported cable channels in the united states market in  the hallmark channel ranked th in total day with an average household rating for the year and th for prime time with an average household rating for the year  according to nielsen media research 
in  among the ad supported cable channels in the united states market  the hallmark channel ranked th in total day with an average household rating and th for prime time with an average household rating  according to nielsen media research 
total day means the time period measured from the time each day the broadcast of commercially sponsored programming commences to the time such commercially sponsored programming ends 
we believe that the key demographics for the hallmark channel are the viewers in the groups adults aged to and women aged to the average median age of a viewer of the hallmark channel in was licensing revenue until we sold our domestic library to rhi entertainment llc on december   we licensed our film assets to broadcasters and video distributors pay television channel providers who paid a license fee for the right to exhibit or distribute the programming over a certain period of time 
programming our channels offer a range of high quality entertainment programming for adults and families including movies  miniseries  epics  historical dramas  romances  literary classics  and contemporary stories 
sources for programming on our channels include programming licensed from rhi entertainment distribution and programming licensed from other third parties 
examples of programming from the rhi entertainment distribution library include  larry mcmurtry s lonesome dove  the outsider  talking to heaven  frederick forsyth s icon  supernova and larry mcmurtry s dead man s walk 
we benefit from these original rhi entertainment distribution productions  which aired and are sometimes premiered on our channel 
examples of other third party programming shown on our channel include the popular drama series m a s h  little house on the prairie  diagnosis murder  matlock  walker texas ranger and the waltons 
other examples of our third party programming include acquired movies and miniseries such as march of the penguins  troy  certain an american girl movies and when harry met sally 
our license agreements with third parties typically provide for a license fee paid out over the term of the license for the right to exhibit a program in the united states within a specified period of time 
our channels air and benefit from programming previously shown as hallmark hall of fame such as john grisham s painted house  fallen angel  sarah  plain and tall and what the deaf man heard 
we have rights to a number of original movies and mini series under our programming agreement with rhi entertainment distribution 
see hallmark entertainment distribution rhi entertainment distribution programming agreement in item certain relationships and related transactions 
we have sublicensed exhibition rights to several programs for  and in order to save on programming costs 
distribution the hallmark channel ended with million subscribers  an increase of from million at the year end 
we currently distribute the hallmark channel to approximately of all united states pay television subscribers

sales and marketing our primary target demographics are women aged to and adults aged to and our secondary target is adults aged to our programming is targeted to adults  but is generally appropriate for viewing by the entire family  which is important to viewers  advertisers and affiliates alike 
for over fifty years hallmark has been a leader in high quality original television production 
the hallmark channel and the hallmark movie channel are the only major cable television channels which broadcast the movies previously shown as hallmark hall of fame  a selection of movies from an award winning entertainment series 
the power of the hallmark brand and the quality and viewer appeal of rhi entertainment distribution programming combine to provide our viewers with tangible evidence of our commitment to the best in entertainment for the entire family  enhance our ability to attract advertising commitments and higher cost per thousands cpm from the largest advertisers  and provide a competitive advantage in negotiating long term distribution agreements with pay television distributors

these sites provide additional programming information and advertiser sponsorship opportunities 
hallmark movie channel we fully launched our second hour linear channel  the hallmark movie channel  during the first quarter of the hallmark movie channel focuses on movies and mini series 
the launch of the hallmark movie channel provides an opportunity for the company to build a second programming asset and use this programming asset as a value added enhancement to increase distribution of the hallmark channel 
channel operations the programming department has been responsible for ensuring the consistent quality of the programming we offer 
the programming  scheduling and acquisitions departments work in conjunction with the traffic department and creative services to create the distinctive appearance of our channels 
some of these functions are outsourced on an as needed basis 
the creation of our channels begins with the acquisition of programming 
we license programming from rhi entertainment distribution and other program suppliers 
our staff or third parties review and summarize all potential programming to ensure compliance with our quality and content standards 
the creation of on air promotional segments interstitials  which are broadcast between the feature movies  miniseries and series  are typically outsourced to external vendors 
these interstitials are intended to invite viewership  guide viewers to specific programming  and promote brand awareness for the hallmark channel and the hallmark movie channel 
the scheduling department creates the play list  which contains a list of daily programming 
the scheduling department works with advertising sales and marketing personnel to continuously monitor the programming mix 
the play list is then forwarded to the traffic department 
the traffic department inserts promotional segments and advertising into the play list and creates the daily log  which contains a detailed schedule of the stream of programming  commercials and promotional materials that will ultimately be viewed by the subscribers of the hallmark channel 
channel delivery we deliver the daily log and digital tapes of the channels programming  commercials and promotional messages to a third party network operations center in denver  colorado  where the programming  advertising and promotional elements are combined and compressed into a single signal  and transported to an uplink facility in denver  colorado 
the uplink facility then transmits the signal to a satellite transponder that covers the united states and the transponder transmits the signal back to cable head end facilities and direct to home satellite services operated by pay television distributors who receive and decode our signal and transmit our channels to their subscribers

amounts payable under these contracts  as well as international contracts  are reflected in operating and capital leases in the schedule of contractual commitments as of december   as shown in item below 
competition the pay television industry is highly competitive 
our channels have competed for distribution  viewers and advertisers with other pay television channels  broadcast television channels and with other general forms of entertainment 
there are several sources of competition within our industry  each of which affects our business strategy 
the hallmark channel competes with other general entertainment programming from tnt  usa network  a e  the discovery channel  lifetime  oxygen  abc family and other similarly targeted channels 
we compete with these channels for viewers and advertising dollars based upon quality of programming  number of subscribers  ratings and subscriber demographics 
we compete with all channels for carriage on cable  satellite and telephone systems that may have limited capacity 
competition continues to intensify as the industry shifts from analog distribution to digital distribution 
many pay television distributors have upgraded their physical infrastructures to accommodate digital delivery  which provides significantly more channel capacity 
we believe that it will take several years for the majority of current subscribers to convert to  and begin paying for  upgraded services 
in an effort to accelerate the conversion  pay television distributors are attempting to place new channels on their digital tier as opposed to their limited  yet more widely distributed  analog tiers 
although competition for the remaining analog channel space is still intense  as more and more subscribers are converted  the digital tier is expected to become the dominant platform 
competitive strengths we have established a track record of providing high quality programming 
we believe that our primary competitive strengths include the following pay television channels branded with the well known hallmark name our channels are branded with the hallmark name 
we believe that viewers and distributors associate the hallmark brand with family values and high quality content 
our association with this brand facilitates our efforts to achieve increased distribution and to attract additional viewers  which in turn leads to higher ratings and advertising revenue 
distribution contracts that call for increasing subscriber counts and fees at december   we had distribution agreements with cablevision  charter  comcast  cox  directv  echostar  and time warner in the united states  as well as a number of other distributors 
the terms of our major distribution agreements generally provide for subscriber fee increases over time  although some provide for lower or no subscriber fees if certain levels of subscribers are achieved 
see risk factors relating to our business below 
experienced management members of our senior management team have experience promoting and operating channels 
they have held senior positions at such companies as court tv  abc  cbs sports  fox family  discovery channel  amc and usa networks 
competitive risks one primary channel distributed domestically we operate one primary channel in the united states 
many of our competitors have more than one channel and are also diversified entertainment companies  giving them an advantage in dealing with distributors and advertisers 
these companies are also able to leverage costs across multiple channels 
until the hallmark movie channel is more widely distributed  it will not provide significant leverage in negotiations with distributors and advertisers 
entertainment programming our programming is entertainment designed for adults and families and is intended to meet quality standards that are associated with the hallmark trademark 
our competitors may have more flexibility in programming 
ratings which affect advertising our ratings have improved substantially over the last three years 
nevertheless  our competitors include channels with more subscribers and higher ratings  which affects rates that we can charge for advertising 
research the research department at the company provides strategic and tactical guidance to decision makers within the company  as well as supplying information about the channels to our potential advertisers and affiliates 
this department provides data on the size and demographics of our audience and information about our audiences  competitors  markets and industry 
currently  our channel s research department translates our overall business strategy into a cohesive research program 
this information assists our executives to more effectively target  brand  promote  program  and better understand where opportunities lie  in order to increase our channel s market share 
the research department has sophisticated research tools and competitive tracking database hardware and software 
trends and changes from these ratings systems are reported to top management for short and long term strategic planning 
our channel s performance is tracked through an internal tracking study established in july  which is a monthly telephone survey conducted among a national probability sample of approximately  adults 
the research department also subscribes to a number of other services  which are useful in obtaining information about viewers of our channel 
employees we had employees at december   and employees at december  neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are parties to collective bargaining agreements 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
most of our channels employees work at our offices in studio city  california and new york  new york

among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are those discussed below in this form k 
crown media holdings will not update any forward looking statements contained in this form k to reflect future events or developments 
if we do not successfully address the risks described below  our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations or cash flow could be materially adversely affected 
the trading price of our class a common stock could decline because of any of these risks 
risks relating to our business our business has incurred net losses since inception and may continue to incur losses 
both our channels have a history of net losses and we expect to continue to report net losses for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately billion  total stockholders deficit of approximately million  and goodwill of approximately million 
we cannot assure you that we will achieve or sustain profitability 
if we are not able to achieve or sustain profitability  the trading price of our class a common stock may fall significantly 
to diminish our losses and become profitable  we will need to substantially increase our advertising and subscriber revenue 
this will require  among other things  maintaining the distribution of our channels  attracting more viewers to our channels  attracting more advertisers  and increasing our subscriber and advertising rates 
risks associated with these areas of our business are described below 
in addition  in order to accomplish these goals  the management of crown media holdings continues to believe that it is necessary to maintain subscriber levels and enhance our programming  which may result in increased subscriber acquisition fees and will result in increased costs for programming 
over the last four years  these actions have contributed to increased net losses for crown media holdings 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health  and the restrictions imposed by the terms of our debt instruments may severely limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 
as of december   our total debt was million and we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million available under our bank credit facility subject to the approval of our board of directors to cover the negative cash flow resulting from our current operations 
subject to restrictions under our debt agreements  we may also seek equity or debt financing from time to time to cover our operating losses  to finance acquisitions or capital expenditures or for other purposes 
as a result of our level of debt and the terms of our debt instruments our vulnerability to adverse general economic conditions is heightened  we will be required to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to repayment of debt  limiting the availability of cash for other purposes  we are and will continue to be limited by financial and other restrictive covenants in our ability to borrow additional funds  consummate asset sales  enter into transactions with affiliates or conduct mergers and acquisitions  our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry will be limited  we are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates  and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired 
our ability to meet our debt and other obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performances and on economic  financial  competitive and other factors 
there can be no assurance that our leverage and such restrictions will not materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 
information concerning our liquidity may be found in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
we have increasing interest expense  which may impact our future operations 
high levels of interest expense could have negative effects on our future operations 
interest expense  which is net of interest income and includes amortization of debt issuance costs and interest expense on borrowings under our senior and demand notes and bank credit facility  increased substantially over the past year 
the increase in interest expense in the past twelve months resulted from an increase in the average borrowings outstanding  due to cash generated from operations being insufficient to cover operating expenses and capital expenditures 
a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be used to pay our interest expense and will not be available for other business purposes 
in addition  we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future financings will be available to provide sufficient proceeds to meet our obligations or to service our total debt 
our liquidity is dependent on external funds 
because we currently operate at a loss  we may have a negative cash flow and any unanticipated significant expense or any development that hampers our growth in revenue or decreases any of our revenue  would result in the need for additional external funds in order to continue operations 
further  as discussed in this report under liquidity and capital resources below  we need to extend  refinance or replace our bank line of credit on or prior to may   or to extend or replace borrowings from hallmark cards by may   that would result from the banks drawing upon the irrevocable letter of credit supporting the bank credit facility or from hallmark cards purchasing the loans under that facility see note to our consolidated financial statements  and extend or refinance outstanding notes payables to hallmark cards and its subsidiaries on or prior to may  upon maturity of the credit facility on may   the lending group led by jp morgan chase has the right to elect to forego the receipt of cash to pay the principal amount of the credit facility in full  which is provided for under the terms of an irrevocable letter of credit provided by hallmark cards described in note but instead can elect to initiate a process to foreclose on the company s assets 
such foreclosure proceedings  which we view as a remote possibility  would affect our ability to continue our operations 
prior to any such possible foreclosure proceedings  however  the company would consider various alternatives as indicated above 
in the alternative  the company would cause hallmark cards  pursuant to the terms of the waiver and standby purchase agreement  to exercise its option to purchase the banks interest in the credit facility and the credit facility would then be subject to hallmark cards agreement not to demand payment prior to may  we need to renew distribution agreements covering more than a majority of our subscribers  which expire prior to december  our distribution agreements with four of the major distributors in the united states  accounting for approximately of our subscriber base as of december   will terminate on or prior to december  pursuant to the terms of the agreements 
if we are unable to renew these distribution agreements  we could lose substantial numbers of subscribers 
although we believe we will be able to negotiate new agreements on favorable terms  it is difficult to predict what the level of subscriber fees will be or whether the distributors will request marketing or launch support payments as a condition for renewal 
any significant loss of subscribers  reduction in subscriber fees or obligation to pay launch support or marketing payments could materially affect our subscriber and advertising revenues and affect materially our cash flow and ability to achieve profitability 
most favored nations provisions may require modification of existing distribution agreements which could adversely affect subscriber revenues 
a number of our existing distribution agreements contain most favored nations or mfn clauses 
these clauses typically provide that  in the event we enter into an agreement with another distributor on more favorable terms  these terms must be offered to the distributor holding the mfn right  subject to certain exceptions and conditions 
distribution agreements which we may enter into in the future may also contain similar mfn clauses 
in the past  after entering into new distribution agreements  we have been asked by some of the distributors holding mfn rights to modify their distribution agreements to incorporate financial terms similar to those in the new agreements 
any claims of this type in the future could result in lower overall subscriber revenues or increased cash outlays  however  if our subscription base is increased as a result of such modifications  it could result in higher advertising revenue 
if we are unable to obtain programming from third parties  we may be unable to increase our subscriber base 
we compete with other pay television channel providers to acquire programming 
if we fail to continue to obtain programming on reasonable terms for any reason  including as a result of competition  we could be forced to incur additional costs to acquire such programming or look for alternative programming  which may hinder the growth of our subscriber base 
if our programming declines in popularity  our subscriber fees and advertising revenue could fall 
our success depends partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control  such as viewer preferences  competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities 
we may not be able to anticipate and react effectively to shifts in tastes and interests in our markets 
our competitors may have greater numbers of original productions  better distribution  and greater capital resources  and may be able to react more quickly to shifts in tastes and interests 
as a result  we may be unable to maintain the commercial success of any of our current programming  or to generate sufficient demand and market acceptance for our new programming 
a shift in viewer preferences in programming or alternative entertainment activities could also cause a decline in both advertising and subscriber fees revenue 
the decline in revenue could hinder or prevent us from achieving profitability and could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
if we are unable to increase our advertising revenue  we may be unable to achieve profitability 
although it is expected over time that our advertising revenue will increase  if we fail to significantly increase our advertising revenue  we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability or to expand our business 
a failure to increase advertising revenue may be a result of any or all of the following i we have a limited history of marketing and selling advertising time  ii we may be unable to identify  attract and retain experienced sales and marketing personnel with relevant experience  iii our sales and marketing organization may be unable to successfully compete against the significantly more extensive and well funded sales and marketing operations of our current or potential competitors  iv the advancement of technologies such as digital video recording which may cause advertisers to shift their expenditures to media in which their commercial messages are not circumvented by the technology  and or v we will not be able to increase our advertising sales rate card or may be required to run additional advertising spots which affect the availability of advertising inventory for future sales 
success in increasing our advertising revenue also depends upon the number and coverage of the distributors who carry our channels  our number of subscribers  and the viewership ratings for our programming 
hallmark entertainment investments controls us and this control could create conflicts of interest or inhibit potential changes of control 
hallmark entertainment investments controls all of our outstanding shares of class b common stock and owns shares of our class a common stock  representing in the aggregate approximately of the outstanding voting power on all matters submitted to our stockholders 
hallmark entertainment holdings  a subsidiary of hallmark cards  controls the voting of all our shares held by hallmark entertainment investments 
hallmark entertainment investments control could discourage others from initiating potential merger  takeover or other change of control transactions that may otherwise be beneficial to our business or holders of class a common stock 
as a result  the market price of our class a common stock could suffer  and our business could suffer 
hallmark entertainment investments control relationship with us also could give rise to conflicts of interest in certain situations 
we could lose the right to use the name hallmark because we have limited duration license agreements  which could harm our business 
we license the name hallmark from hallmark licensing  inc  a subsidiary of hallmark cards  for use in the names of our channels 
this license will expire on september  if hallmark cards determines not to renew the trademark license agreements for any reason  including failure to comply with hallmark cards programming standards  we would be forced to significantly revise our business plan and operations  and could experience a significant erosion of our subscriber base and advertising revenue 
if our third party suppliers fail to provide us with network infrastructure services on a timely basis  our costs could increase and our growth could be hindered 
we currently rely on third parties to supply key network infrastructure services  including uplink  playback  transmission and satellite services to our market  which are available only from limited sources 
we have occasionally experienced delays and other problems in receiving communications equipment  services and facilities and may  in the future  be unable to obtain such services  equipment or facilities on the scale and within the time frames required by us on terms we find acceptable  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain  or if we experience a delay in the delivery of  such services  we may be forced to incur significant unanticipated expenses to secure alternative third party suppliers or adjust our operations  which could hinder our growth and reduce our revenue and potential profitability 
if we are unable to retain key executives and other personnel  our growth could be inhibited and our business harmed 
our success depends on the expertise and continued service of our executive officers and key employees of our subsidiaries 
if we fail to attract  hire or retain the necessary personnel  or if we lose the services of our key executives  we may be unable to implement our business plan or keep pace with developing trends in our industry 
the amount of our goodwill may hinder our ability to achieve profitability 
as a result of our acquisitions of all the common interests in crown media united states  we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill 
we are required to periodically review whether the value of our goodwill has been impaired 
if we are required to write down our goodwill  our results of operations  stockholders equity deficit could be materially adversely affected 
our stock price may be volatile and could decline substantially 
the stock market has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
many factors may cause the market price for our class a common stock to decline  including our operating results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in any quarter  material announcements by us or our competitors  governmental regulatory action  technological innovations by competitors or competing technologies  investor perceptions of our industry or prospects  or those of our customers  changes in general market conditions or economic trends  and failure to renew major distribution agreements 
additionally  of the approximately million shares of the company s outstanding class a common stock  only million shares approximately are not held by affiliates of the company 
this stock ownership structure may also be a cause of volatility in the market price of the company s class a common stock 
risks relating to our industry the proposed change in television ratings in the united states could reduce our channel revenue and our ability to achieve profitability 
our domestic advertising revenues are partially dependent on television ratings provided by nielsen media research 
nielsen has modified its ratings system by increasing its household sample size and plans to institute other changes in its audience measurement systems although these modifications have not negatively impacted our ratings to date  as the impact of the changes continue to take effect our ratings could either be positively or negatively affected by these changes  depending on the demographic characteristics of the households added to the nielsen sample and the natures of the changes in the measurement systems 
nielsen is continually in the process of modifying its ratings system to accommodate emerging technologies 
competition could reduce our channel revenue and our ability to achieve profitability 
we operate in the pay television business  which is highly competitive 
if we are unable to compete effectively with large diversified entertainment companies that have substantially greater resources than we have  our operating margins and market share could be reduced  and the growth of our business inhibited 
in particular  we compete for distribution with other pay television channels and  when distribution is obtained  for viewers and advertisers with pay television channels  broadcast television networks  radio  the internet and other media 
we also compete  to varying degrees  with other leisure time activities such as movie theaters  the internet  radio  print media  electronic games and other alternative sources of entertainment and information 
future technological developments may affect competition within this business 
a continuing trend towards business combinations and alliances in the communications industries may create significant new competitors for us or intensify existing competition 
many of these combined entities have more than one channel and resources far greater than ours 
these combined entities may provide bundled packages of programming  delivery and other services that compete directly with the products we offer 
we may need to reduce our prices or license additional programming to remain competitive  and we may be unable to sustain future pricing levels as competition increases 
our failure to achieve or sustain market acceptance of our programming at desired pricing levels could impair our ability to achieve profitability or positive cash flow  which would harm our business 
distributors in the united states may attempt to pressure pay tv channels with lower viewership  such as our channel  to accept decreasing amounts for subscriber fees  to pay higher subscriber acquisition fees or to allow carriage of the channel without the payment of subscriber fees 
factors that may lead to this pressure include the number of competing pay tv channels  the limited space available on services of distributors in the united states and the desire of distributors to maintain or reduce costs 
any reduction in subscriber fees revenue now or in the future could have a material impact on our ability to achieve profitability and cash flow 
new distribution technologies may fundamentally change the way we distribute our channels and could significantly decrease our revenue or require us to incur significant capital expenditures 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes and to offer  on a timely basis  services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards 
the pay television industry has been  and is likely to continue to be  subject to rapid and significant technological change  including continuing developments in technology which do not presently have widely accepted standards  and frequent introductions of new services and alternative technologies  including new technologies for providing video services 
for example  the advent of digital technology is likely to accelerate the convergence of broadcast  telecommunications  internet and other media and could result in material changes in the economics  regulations  intellectual property usage and technical platforms on which our business relies  including lower retail rates for video services 
these changes could fundamentally affect the scale  source  and volatility of our revenue streams  cost structures  and profitability  and may require us to significantly change our operations 
we also rely in part on third parties for the development of  and access to  communications and network technology 
as a result  we may be unable to obtain access to new technology on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  which could harm our business and prospects 
moreover  the increased capacity of digital distribution platforms  including the introduction of digital terrestrial television  may reduce the competition for the right to carry channels and allow development of extra services at low incremental cost 
these lower incremental costs could lower barriers to entry for competing channels  and place pressure on our operating margins and market position 
changes in laws or regulations could adversely affect our distribution and thus our revenues 
the federal communications commission or congress may enact requirements that cable program services be offered to subscribers on an a la carte basis  ie be made available for purchase separately and not as part of a package of services or that the services be offered in specific packages such as a so called family tier 
such requirements could result in a reduction in the total number of subscribers to our program services and adversely affect advertising revenue 
if we fail to comply with applicable government regulations  our business could be harmed 
if  we as a provider of television channels  fail to comply with applicable present or future government regulations  we could be prohibited from distributing our program services and could be subject to monetary fines or directives  which would increase our operating costs  and  therefore  affect our ability to achieve profitability 
moreover  broadcasting regulations are generally subject to periodic and on going governmental review and legislative initiatives  which may  in the future  affect the nature of programming we are able to offer and the means by which it is distributed 
the timing  scope or outcome of these reviews could be unfavorable to us  and any changes to current broadcasting legislation or regulations could require adjustments to our operations

with million subscribers as provided by nielsen research in the united states at december   crown media holdings is the th most widely distributed advertising supported cable channel in the united states 
for the fourth quarter of  we finished the quarter as the th highest rated advertising supported cable channel for total day ratings and the th highest rated advertising supported cable channel in prime time as measured by nielsen research 
we launched our second hour linear channel  the hallmark movie channel  during the first quarter of the hallmark movie channel focuses on movies and mini series 
it will generate advertising revenue in and as distribution continues to expand  the financial contribution of the hallmark movie channel may grow 
the hallmark movie channel is operated through crown media holdings existing infrastructure at a small incremental cost  which will increase since we have completed the sale of our domestic film library 
for information regarding the sale of the domestic film library  through the sale of the company s membership interest in crown media distribution  see note and note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
current challenges the hallmark channel faces challenges on the distribution front 
the distribution agreements are important because they affect our number of subscribers  which in turn has a major impact on our subscriber fees  the number of persons viewing our programming  and thus rates charged for advertising 
we have an ongoing focus on growing our subscriber base 
the current and long term distribution challenges will be renewing our distribution arrangements with the multiple system operators as they expire 
our major distribution agreements have terms which expire at various times through february of these distribution agreements  agreements accounting for approximately of our subscriber base at december   will expire and be the subject of renewal negotiations on or prior to december  while the economics of the renewals and potential cash incentive payments are unknown and could have a significant impact on our business  we believe that the ratings success of the hallmark channel and the positive family friendly environment we have created with our programming schedule has assisted in our renewal discussions 
any renewals of these distribution agreements may also be significant as to whether we are able to maintain or increase our subscriber fees 
the company has recently renewed its agreements with two major distributors 
domestic telephone companies are entering into the business of distributing television channels to households through their wire lines 
we have reached agreements with several telephone companies and cooperatives of telephone companies  which permit the carriage of the hallmark channel and the hallmark movie channel  and are negotiating with others 
we expect that subscribers to these telephone services will in large part be customers previously served by existing cable television companies and satellite television companies 
to date  subscribers and revenues through telephone companies have been insignificant 
three factors have contributed to the ratings improvements of the hallmark channel acquired series and movies  original productions and marketing 
acquired series such as little house on the prairie  walker  texas ranger and m a s h have consistently delivered strong ratings across all day parts 
original productions are our most high profile programs and generate the channel s highest ratings 
original productions are significant in helping our distribution and advertising sales teams sell the channel 
substantially all of our original programming has been provided by rhi entertainment 
the company typically incurs additional marketing expenses surrounding original productions and certain acquired movies 
we have extended our program license for m a s h  however  commencing january   our rights became non exclusive in cable television and we may only broadcast the series from am to am previously  m a s h has been aired on the hallmark channel during primetime on an exclusive basis 
this change was made for cost savings 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we filled the late night programming position previously occupied by m a s h with two hour movies 
to date  the ratings from this day part have not been significantly different from the ratings received when m a s h filled this programming position 
to continue the ratings growth and enhance the demographics of our viewers  including attracting a younger audience  the hallmark channel must continue to invest in programming and marketing 
delivering strong ratings growth to larger audiences has made it possible for our advertising sales to grow rapidly over the last few years 
to advertisers  the hallmark channel offers a strong brand  positive environment and family friendly programming with a successful growth pattern 
these characteristics have enabled the channel to sell to a broader range of advertisers  including those in the packaged goods and pharmaceutical industries 
we sold approximately of our inventory for advertising on our channels in the upfront market generally sales in june  july and august for the last quarter of and the first three quarters of  compared to to sold in the upfront market 
we were able to achieve significant increases in our cpm s in the upfront market for next year compared to the upfront market for this year 
the balance of advertising inventory will be made available in the scatter market  which in the past has yielded higher advertising rates than the upfront market 
international business please see note in our consolidated financial statements sale of the international business of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
sale of membership interests in crown media distribution please see note in our consolidated financial statements sale of membership interests in crown media distribution of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
impairment of assets please see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report for information on impairment charges for  and revenue from continuing operations our revenue consists primarily of subscriber fees and advertising fees  and included until december  film asset license fees 
subscriber fees subscriber fees are generally payable to us on a per subscriber basis by pay television distributors for the right to carry our channels 
in the past  we have paid certain television distributors up front subscriber acquisition fees to carry our channel 
subscriber acquisition fees that we pay are capitalized and amortized over the contractual term of the applicable distribution agreement as a reduction in subscriber fee revenue 
if the amortization expense exceeds the revenue recognized on a per distributor basis  the excess amortization is included as a component of cost of services 
at the time we sign a distribution agreement  we evaluate the recoverability of the costs we incur against the incremental revenue directly and indirectly associated with each agreement 
rates we receive per subscriber vary according to the level of sophistication and degree of competition in the market  the relative position in the market of the distributor and the popularity of the channel  the packaging arrangements for the channel  and other commercial terms and length of the contract term 
we are in continuous negotiations with our existing distributors to increase our subscriber base in order to enhance our advertising results 
we have been subject to requests by major distributors to pay subscriber acquisition fees for additional subscribers or to waive or accept lower subscriber fees if certain numbers of additional subscribers are provided 
we also may help fund the distributors efforts to market our channels or we may permit distributors to offer limited promotional periods without payment of subscriber fees 
as we continue our efforts to add subscribers  our subscriber revenue may continue to be negatively affected by subscriber acquisition fee amortization  waiver of subscriber fees and bulk discounts resulting from the attainment of certain subscriber levels  however  we believe these measures  if necessary  will help us increase our subscriber base more quickly  which in turn will allow us to attract additional advertisers and command higher advertising rates 
our channel is usually offered as one of a number of channels on either a basic tier or part of other program packages and is not generally offered on a stand alone basis 
thus  while a cable or satellite customer may subscribe and unsubscribe to the tiers and program packages in which our channel is placed  these customers do not subscribe and unsubscribe to our channel alone 
we are not provided with information from the distributors on their overall subscriber churn and in what manner their churn rates affect our subscriber counts  instead  we are provided information on the total number of subscribers who receive the hallmark channel 
our subscriber count depends on the number of distributors carrying the hallmark channel and the size of such distributors as well as the program tiers on which our channel is carried by these distributors 
from time to time  we experience decreases in the number of subscribers as promotional periods end  or as a distributor arrangement is amended or terminated by us or the distributor 
changes to distribution arrangements during the year ended december   have not been significant 
management analyzes the estimated effect each new or amended distribution agreement will have on revenues and costs 
based upon these analyses  management endeavors to achieve a fair combination of subscriber commitments and subscriber acquisition fees with each of our domestic distributors 
advertising our advertising rates are generally calculated on the basis of an agreed upon price per unit of audience measurement in return for a guaranteed commitment by the advertiser 
we commit to provide advertisers certain rating levels in connection with their advertising 
revenue is recorded net of estimated delivery shortfalls  which are usually settled by providing the advertiser additional advertising time 
advertising rates also vary by time of year due to seasonal changes in television viewership 
film asset license fees crown media distribution generated revenue from the film assets by granting licenses to third parties to exhibit the films in the united states 
we also used the films as programming for the hallmark channel and the hallmark movie channel 
customers for our film assets consisted of other television channels  home video distributors and brokers who resold rights to our film assets 
license fees for our film assets were generally negotiated based upon  among other things  the size of the potential audience who were to be viewing the programming and the term of the license 
the market for our film library was typically seasonal  with over half of the annual sales occurring in the fourth quarter in past years 
this seasonality was generally due to the timing of our customers program scheduling activities 
in  film licensing activities and revenues were negatively affected by the sale process of the company s film library  which sale closed in december due to the sale of the company s film library  we will not have film licensing activities in the future 
cost of services our cost of services consists primarily of program license fees  subscriber acquisition fee expense  the cost of signal distribution  administration  distribution and  until we sold our film assets  amortization of and other exploitation of our film assets  and the cost of promotional segments that are aired between programs 
we expect cost of services to continue to increase in the future as we expand our existing markets and third party programming to support our advertising strategy 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates we have identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations  either past or present 
for further information regarding our critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates  please see the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
these policies and estimates are considered critical because they either had a material impact or they have the potential to have a material impact on our financial statements  and because they require significant judgments  assumptions or estimates 
our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions made when accounting for the items described below are reasonable  based on information available at the time they were made 
however  there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
the following discussion concerns certain accounting estimates and assumptions that are considered to be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for uncertain matters and the susceptibility of such matters to changes 
residual and participation liabilities the company accounts for the future costs for residual and participation liabilities to the various guilds associated with the sales  licensing and internal use of the domestic and international film assets 
following the december  sale of the film library  the company will not incur new obligations of this nature 
pursuant to amendment no 
to the purchase agreement dated december   the company shall indemnify rhi for such liabilities that arise through december  up to a maximum amount of million 
the company s actual cost for this obligation will depend on the level of rhi s domestic library sales during this period 
any revision to this estimated liability will be reflected as gain loss from the sale of film assets also  the company estimated a liability of approximately million to pay the estimated residual and participation costs that the buyer would otherwise be obligated to pay to third parties through april in connection with international film library sales 
the company s actual cost for this obligation will depend on the buyer s actual usage or sales of these films 
any revisions to this estimated liability will be reflected as gain loss from the sale of discontinued operations in future periods 
the liability the company will owe is not subject to any contractual limitation 
we consider our estimates of future domestic and international sales of the film assets by the respective buyers to be critical because determining the extent and timing of future film sales requires significant judgment and is subject to refinement as facts and circumstances change 
to the extent these estimates are more or less than the actual liability resulting from the resolution of these matters  our earnings will be increased or decreased accordingly 
if the differences are material  our consolidated financial statements could be materially impacted 
film asset amortization and film library impairment the company amortized its film assets using the individual film forecast computation method over a maximum period of years from the date of acquisition 
the individual film forecast computation method amortized such assets in the same ratio that period revenue bore to estimated ultimate future revenues 
the company reviewed its estimates of ultimate future revenues and participation costs on a quarterly basis to reflect currently available information 
estimated ultimate future revenues were based on the history of each film and similar films  sales and marketing plans  and other factors  all of which required significant judgment and estimation by management 
differences between amortization expense determined using the new estimates and any amounts previously expensed during that current fiscal year were charged or credited to the statement of operations in the period in which the estimates were revised 
for use of the film assets on the hallmark channel and the hallmark movie channel  the company estimated the fair value of the internal usage based upon the portion of the film s ultimate revenues attributable to the term of the license window 
the company first calculated the amount of cost attributable to the internal use using the individual film forecast computation method described above and then expensed such amounts ratably over the term of the license window 
on a quarterly basis  the company assessed whether events or circumstances had changed indicating that the fair value of a film was lower than its unamortized cost or carrying value 
if the carrying value of any individual film asset exceeded its fair value  the film asset was written down to its estimated fair value 
the company considered the following factors  among others  in estimating cash flows and fair values for each film a the operating environment expected for the next several years  b the size of the library as a whole  c historical license fee revenue per film  d each title s age  quality  and marketability  e existing sales plans including the amount of product desired to be sold each year  f future performance estimates  g assumptions and estimates underlying past and future estimates  h risk factors that could effect future operations of the library and i offers from potential buyers of the film assets 
in estimating a film s fair value  the company considered those cash outflows necessary to generate the film s cash inflows such as exploitation  residual and participation costs and taxes 
the discount rate used in the company s discounted cash flow model was based upon management s estimate of the rate a purchaser would require related to the risks and uncertainties surrounding the timing and probability of the cash flow estimates 
we believe that our estimation of the fair value of film assets  future ultimate revenues and estimated sales to third parties and internal usage of our film assets prior to their sale were critical accounting estimate  because the estimates of sales and fair value involve a significant degree of judgment and were subject to refinement as facts and circumstances change 
program license fees program license fees are paid in connection with the acquisition of the rights to air programs acquired from others 
the cost of program rights are deferred and then amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of their contractual license periods or anticipated usage 
on a quarterly basis  the company evaluates the recoverability of these deferred license fees in relation to the estimated future revenues 
this analysis is based upon the critical management estimates of net realizable value for program license fees that are determined using future estimated advertising revenues and anticipated patterns of programming usage on a day part basis as it pertains to programming licensed to the channel 
the estimate of usage and advertising revenues involve a significant degree of judgment and are subject to refinement as facts and circumstances change 
accordingly  this is considered a critical accounting estimate 
these estimates of expected annual future estimated revenues are compared to net book value of the program license fee assets to determine if the programming assets are expected to be recovered 
where the analysis indicates the costs are in excess of the estimated net realizable value  additional programming costs are recognized for the difference 
any changes to these estimates could materially impact our financial statements or results of operations 
long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets  other than goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the asset s carrying value is not recoverable  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the company determines fair values by using a combination of comparable market values and discounted cash flows  as appropriate 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually on november or whenever an event occurs or there is a change in circumstances that indicates fair value might be less than carrying value 
goodwill is carried at historical cost if the estimated fair value is greater than the carrying amounts 
however  if estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount  goodwill would be reduced to the estimated fair value through an impairment charge to the company s consolidated statements of operations 
cash flow projections include long term forecasts of revenue growth  gross margins and capital expenditures 
all of these items require significant judgment and assumptions 
if estimates of future cash flows are different from our assumptions  we may conclude that some of our long lived assets are not recoverable  which would likely cause us to record a material impairment charge 
also  if future cash flows are significantly lower than the projections we may determine at some future date that some of our long lived assets are not recoverable

cash flows as of december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents on hand 
as of december   the company had borrowed million from a million revolving bank credit  which matures may  the company s principal sources of funds are cash on hand  cash generated by operations  tax sharing payments from hallmark cards and amounts available under the company s revolving bank credit facility 
payments under the tax sharing agreement are affected by hallmark cards tax position and its ability to utilize the company s tax losses 
the company received million in tax sharing payments in and does not currently expect to receive tax sharing payments during the company currently has million of unused revolving credit capacity 
the company s ability to borrow additional amounts under the credit facility is not limited or restricted as long as no covenants have been violated 
the ability of the existing sources of liquidity to be sufficient to fund the company s operations depends upon continued growth in subscriber revenue and advertising revenue 
any decline in the popularity of the hallmark channel  any significant future modifications to the company s distribution agreements  an economic decline in the advertising market  an increase in program acquisition costs  an increase in competition or other adverse operating conditions would impact the company s liquidity and its ability to fund the current level of operations the company expects to continue making investments in programming  marketing and distribution 
however  the company s recurring loss situation has demanded that all areas of expenses  including programming  marketing and distribution be closely monitored and controlled 
the company anticipates that its principal uses of funds for will continue to include the payment of operating expenses  accounts payable and accrued expenses  license fees for programming  and interest under its bank credit facility 
as part of efforts to improve the capital structure  in the company sold its membership interests in crown media distribution as described in sale of membership interests in crown media distribution above 
the company currently believes that cash on hand  cash generated by operations and availability on its bank credit facility  when combined with the deferral of any required payments on related party debt and related interest mentioned below  will be sufficient to fund the company s operations and meet its liquidity needs through may  the company s bank credit facility matures on may  the company significantly reduced the amounts outstanding under the credit facility with the proceeds of the sale of its membership interests in crown media distribution 
in conjunction with these repayments on the credit facility  the company reduced the borrowing capacity under the credit facility to million 
the company intends to extend or refinance the bank credit facility prior to or upon its maturity 
any such extension or refinancing might require a continuation of a letter of credit from hallmark cards or other steps by the company and is not assured 
if the company is not able to arrange for the extension  refinancing or replacement of the bank credit facility prior to its maturity and the bank draws down on the irrevocable letter of credit provided by hallmark cards in support of the bank credit facility  or alternatively hallmark cards purchases the interests of the lending banks  hallmark cards would have all obligations and the rights of the lending banks under the bank credit facility 
in that event  hallmark cards could demand payment of outstanding amounts at any time after may   under the terms of the waiver and standby purchase agreement waiver agreement described below 
upon maturity of the credit facility on may   the lending group led by jp morgan chase has the right to elect to forego the receipt of cash to pay the principal amount of the credit facility in full  which is provided for under the terms of an irrevocable letter of credit provided by hallmark cards  but instead can elect to initiate a process to foreclose on the company s assets 
such foreclosure proceedings  would adversely affect our ability to continue our operations 
prior to any such possible foreclosure proceedings  however  the company  if it has not secured an extension of the credit facility or alternative financing  would cause hallmark cards pursuant to the terms of the waiver agreement to exercise its option to purchase all of the outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility and the credit facility would then be subject to terms of the waiver agreement 
due to the company s possible inability to meet its obligations when they come due on may   the company anticipates that prior to may   it will be necessary to either extend or refinance i the bank credit facility and ii the promissory notes payable to affiliates of hallmark cards described in the notes below 
as part of a combination of actions and in order to obtain additional funding  the company may consider various alternatives  including refinancing the bank credit facility  raising additional capital through the issuance of equity or debt securities  a sale of certain assets or other strategic alternatives

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we only invest in instruments that meet high credit and quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
these instruments  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk 
the fixed income portfolio will decline in value if there is an increase in interest rates 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the decline of the fair value of the fixed income portfolio would not be material 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments had a fair value of million  which was invested in cash and short term commercial paper 
the primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to fund operations 
consequently  the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is provided by and used in our business 
the value of certain investments in this portfolio can be impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets and interest rate fluctuations 
at december   all of our investments in this category were in fixed rate instruments or money market type accounts 
a decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio  since funds would be reinvested at lower rates as the instruments mature 
over time  any net percentage decrease in our interest rates could be reflected in a corresponding net percentage decrease in our interest income 
for the year ended december   the impact of interest rate fluctuations  changed business prospects and all other factors did not have a material impact on the fair value of this portfolio  or on our income derived from this portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
as of december   we are not hedged or otherwise protected against risks associated with any of our investing or financing activities 
we are exposed to market risk 
we are exposed to market risk  including changes to interest rates 
to reduce the volatility relating to these exposures  we may enter into various derivative investment transactions in the near term pursuant to our investment and risk management policies and procedures in areas such as hedging and counterparty exposure practices 
we have not and will not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
though we intend to use risk management control policies  there will be inherent risks that may only be partially offset by our hedging programs should there be any unfavorable movements in interest rates or equity investment prices 
the estimated exposure discussed below is intended to measure the maximum amount we could lose from adverse market movements in interest rates and equity investment prices  given a specified confidence level  over a given period of time 
loss is defined in the value at risk estimation as fair market value loss 
our interest income and expense is subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
our material interest bearing assets consisted of cash equivalents and short term investments 
the balance of our interest bearing assets was million  or approximately of total assets  as of december  our material liabilities subject to interest rate risk consisted of our bank credit facility  our line of credit and interest payable to hc crown  our line of credit and interest payable to hallmark cards affiliate  and our note and interest payable to hallmark cards affiliate 
the balance of those liabilities was million  or of total liabilities  as of december  net interest expense for the year ended december   was million   of our total revenue 
our net interest expense of these liabilities is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates  primarily us and libor interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us and libor interest rates affect the fair value of interest bearing liabilities 
if market interest rates were to increase or decrease by from levels as of december   our interest expense would increase or decrease by million  respectively
