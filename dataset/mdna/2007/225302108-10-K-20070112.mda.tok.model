item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  manufacture  sell and service engineering validation test equipment  diagnostics and failure analysis products and automatic test equipment  or ate  used for testing semiconductor integrated circuits  or ics 
we serve a broad spectrum of the semiconductor industry s testing needs through a wide range of products that test digital logic  mixed signal  system on a chip and radio frequency semiconductors 
we utilize our proprietary technologies to design products which are intended to provide a lower total cost of ownership than many competing products currently available while meeting the increasingly demanding performance requirements of today s engineering validation test  diagnostics and failure analysis and ate markets 
our hardware products are designed to test semiconductors at two stages of their lifecycle  first  at the prototype stage  and  second  as they are produced in high volume 
collectively  our customers include major semiconductor manufacturers  fabless design houses  foundries and assembly and test services companies 
major business developments during and subsequent to fiscal year include david house  a forty year veteran of the computing  communication and semiconductor industries with twenty two years in management positions at intel corporation  was appointed executive chairman of our board of directors  effective december  we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment  sfas r 
we made a decision to discontinue the development of our next generation memory product due to the continued weakening in demand for these products and the decision by one of our large customers to significantly decrease capital spending 
as a result  we wrote down approximately million of inventory during the second quarter of fiscal year we reviewed and evaluated our inventory against our forecast and determined that some of our legacy products demands had decreased 
as a result  we recorded charges of approximately million associated with the write down of inventory and order cancellation charges during the third quarter of fiscal year we performed analyses and determined that goodwill impairment charges of million were necessary  which we recorded in the third quarter of fiscal year in july  we introduced the latest addition to our industry leading sapphire platform  the sapphire d the sapphire d enables the analog and mixed signal scalability needed to balance device manufacturers challenges for sip and mcp device integration and test costs

lev  with more than twenty years of experience in the design tool and semiconductor industries at companies including national semiconductor  intel  sun microsystems  silicon graphics  mips technologies and cadence  was appointed president and chief executive officer  effective december  on december   we completed the exchange in an aggregate principal amount of million of our convertible subordinated notes due in may for a new series of convertible senior subordinated notes due in may  as well as the issuance of new convertible senior subordinated notes with an aggregate principal amount of million 
our sales  gross margins and operating results have in the past fluctuated significantly and will  in the future  fluctuate significantly depending upon a variety of factors 
the factors that have caused and will continue to cause our results to fluctuate include cyclicality or downturns in the semiconductor market and the markets served by our customers  the timing of new product announcements and releases by us or our competitors  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of our products  manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the start up of new products  changes in pricing by us  our competitors  customers or suppliers  the ability to volume produce systems and meet customer requirements  excess and obsolete inventory  patterns of capital spending by customers  delays  cancellations or rescheduling of orders due to customer financial difficulties or 
table of contents otherwise  expenses associated with acquisitions and alliances  our ability to effectively integrate acquisitions  product discounts  product reliability  the proportion of direct sales and sales through third parties  including distributors and original equipment manufacturers  the mix of products sold  the length of manufacturing and sales cycles  natural disasters  political and economic instability  new accounting pronouncements eg  fas r  regulatory changes and outbreaks of hostilities 
due to these and additional factors  historical results and percentage relationships discussed in this annual report on form k will not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations for any future period 
for a further discussion of our business  and risk factors affecting our results of operations  please refer to the section entitled risk factors included elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation and residual values related to leased products  long lived assets valuation  warranty accrual  deferred taxes  restructuring charges and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis  and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition under securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  sab  we recognize revenue on the sale of semiconductor manufacturing equipment when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and customer acceptance criteria have been successfully demonstrated 
revenue recognition policies are applied consistently among our semiconductor manufacturing equipment product lines 
product revenue is recognized upon shipment only when achieving the customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment  which generally occurs with mature products 
revenue related to the fair value of the installation obligation is recognized upon completion of the installation 
service revenues are generally recognized upon performance of the activities requested by the customers 
products are classified as mature after several different customers have accepted similar systems 
when the customer acceptance criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment  revenue and the related cost of goods sold are deferred until customer acceptance 
for some customers in certain countries where collection may be an issue  we may require a letter of credit to be established or cash receipt in advance before revenue can be recognized 
lease revenue is recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for leases  sfas no 
 which requires that a lessor account for each lease by either the sales type or operating method 
revenue from sales type leases is recognized at the net present value of future lease payments 
revenue from operating leases is recognized over the lease period 
during fiscal years and  we introduced several new enhancements  systems and products 
certain revenues from sales of these new enhancements  systems and products during fiscal years and were deferred until the revenue recognition requirements of our revenue recognition policy are satisfied 
this practice will continue in the future 
in the past  we experienced significant delays in the introduction and acceptance of 
table of contents new testers as well as certain enhancements to our existing testers 
delays in introducing a product or delays in our ability to obtain customer acceptance  if they occur in the future  will delay the recognition of revenue and gross profit by us 
with respect to arrangements with multiple deliverables  we follow the guidance in emerging issue task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  to determine whether there is more than one unit of accounting 
to the extent that the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting  we then allocate the total fee on such arrangements to the individual units of accounting using the residual method 
we then recognize revenue for each unit of accounting depending on the nature of the deliverable s comprising the unit of accounting principally following sab 
sales in the united states are principally through our direct sales organization consisting of direct sales employees and representatives 
sales outside the united states utilize both direct sales employees and distributors 
there are no significant differences in revenue recognition policies based on the sales channel  due to the business practices that have been adopted with our distributor relationships 
because of these business practices  we do not use price protection  stock rotation or similar programs with our distributors 
in general  we sell product to the distributor on the basis of a purchase order received from an end customer 
we evaluate any revenue recognition issues  in such cases  based on the characteristics of the end customer 
our semiconductor manufacturing equipment includes embedded software 
we believe this embedded software is incidental to our products and therefore it is excluded from the scope of statement of position  software revenue recognition  sop 
also  the embedded software in our products is not sold separately  cannot be used on another vendor s products  and we cannot fundamentally enhance or expand the capability of the equipment with new or revised embedded software 
in addition  the equipment s principal performance characteristics are governed by digital speed and pin count which are primarily a function of the hardware 
deferred revenue includes deferred revenue related to maintenance contracts and other undelivered services and to extended warranties where products were sold with more than the standard one year warranty 
deferred profit is related to equipment that was shipped to certain customers  but for which the revenue and cost of goods sold are not recognized because the customer specified acceptance criteria has not been met as of the fiscal period end or because the customer is deemed to be a high credit risk and payment has not been received as of the fiscal period end 
we warrant our products to our customers generally for one year from the date of shipment 
in addition to the provision of standard warranties  we may offer customer paid extended warranty services with a fixed fee 
the fixed fees are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the applicable term of the contract 
related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable 
for certain customers  typically those with whom we have long term relationships  we may grant extended payment terms 
certain of our receivables have due dates in excess of days  and we have a history of successfully collecting these extended payment term accounts receivable 
allowance for doubtful accounts we  along with our sales and distribution partners  perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments 
we record our bad debt expenses as selling  general and administrative expenses 
when we become aware that a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations to us  generally because of bankruptcy or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  we record a specific allowance to reflect the level of credit risk in the customer s outstanding receivable balance 
in addition  we record additional allowances based on certain percentages of our aged receivable balances 
these percentages are determined by a variety of factors including  but not limited to  
table of contents current economic trends  historical payment and bad debt write off experience 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of our customers or changes in general economic conditions  and if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of our trade receivables could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if we provide more allowances than we need  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on our actual collection experience 
inventory valuation and residual values related to leased products we evaluate our inventory levels and valuations based on our estimates and forecasts of the next cyclical period in our industry 
these forecasts require us to estimate our ability to sell current and future products in the next cyclical industry period and compare those estimates with our current inventory levels 
if these forecasts or estimates change  or our product roadmaps change  then we would need to adjust our assessment of the inventory valuations 
once inventories are written down  we carry that inventory at its reduced value until it is scrapped or otherwise disposed of 
we monitor our inventory levels in light of product development changes and expectations of the cyclical period ahead 
during the four years period ended october   we have recorded a total of million in write down of excess and obsolete inventories 
we do not as a matter of course scrap all inventory that is identified as excess or obsolete 
our products are capital goods with potentially long economic lives and  historically  the opportunity to sell these products has both arisen and fallen unexpectedly 
we have occasionally encountered unexpected demand for old products as well as the inability to transition customers to newer products 
we closely monitor the inventories that have been written down but not scrapped  so that if any sales of these items occur and affect our reported gross margins  the effect  if material  is disclosed 
we may be required to take additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory if a downturn causes further reductions to our current inventory valuations or if our current product development plans change 
we consign a portion of our finished goods to both external and internal customers primarily for the purpose of customer demonstration or applications development 
this inventory is categorized as other long term assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets 
we depreciate all consigned inventories during the period that they are held on consignment over periods ranging from months to months 
the depreciation expense for consigned inventory is charged to selling  general and administrative expense 
residual values assigned to our products that are leased to customers are based on their remaining economic life at the end of the lease terms 
the amounts assigned to the residual values are evaluated periodically based on technological change and the forecasted business cycle 
long lived asset valuation our long lived assets consist of property and equipment and identified intangible assets 
as required by statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas  we test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis and at any other time events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to our market value falling below our net book value for a significant period of time  a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  a significant change in direction with respect to investment in a product or market segment  the likelihood that a significant portion of the business will be sold or disposed of  or the results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit determined in accordance with sfas the impairment test for goodwill involves a two step process step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
if the 
table of contents carrying amount is in excess of the fair value  step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss 
the determination as to whether a write down of goodwill is necessary involves significant judgment based on the short term and long term projections of our operations 
the assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  discount rates and terminal growth rates  reflect our best estimates 
as mandated by sfas  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of july  during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
we determined that  based on market capitalization and on the test which indicated that the sum of the expected future discounted cash flows from the assets exceeded the earning value of those assets  the goodwill was not impaired 
based on a combination of factors that came into existence and were identified during the third quarter of fiscal year  particularly our changed current and projected operating results reflecting lower demand from major customers  and our current market capitalization which was significantly less than our book value for the preceding weeks prior to the end of the third quarter  we concluded there were sufficient indicators to require us to assess whether any portion of our recorded goodwill balance was impaired 
we determined  based on our estimates of forecasted discounted cash flows and our market capitalization  that our goodwill was impaired at july  further analysis indicated that the entire goodwill balance was impaired and charges of million were necessary in the third quarter of fiscal year other long lived assets were assessed for impairment prior to the performance of sfas analysis and were determined not to be impaired 
we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  consisting primarily of purchased intangible assets  and property and equipment  in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal for long lived assets  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  or at least annually 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in our market value  or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we write down such assets based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
we make certain assessments with respect to the determination of all identifiable assets to be used in the business as well as research and development activities as of an acquisition date 
each of these activities was evaluated by both interviews and data analysis to determine our state of development and related fair value 
the purchased intangibles consist of purchased technology  customer relations  trademarks  patents and non compete agreements  and they typically have estimated useful lives of one to ten years 
warranty accrual we provide reserves for the estimated costs of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we estimate the costs of our warranty obligations based on our historical experience of known product failure rates  
table of contents use of materials to repair or replace defective products and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty accruals may be made if unforeseen technical problems arise 
should our actual experience relative to these factors differ from our estimates  we may be required to record additional warranty reserves 
alternatively  if we provide more reserves than we need  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 
deferred taxes when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we calculate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to calculate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from different treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
the temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we show on our audited consolidated balance sheets 
the net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon weighted available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our net deferred tax asset balance as of october  was million which relates to taxable income generated at our foreign subsidiaries 
our domestic tax assets reflect a full valuation allowance due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income and our corresponding ability to utilize our deferred tax assets 
we are a u 
s 
based multinational company subject to tax in multiple u 
s 
and foreign tax jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate is based on net income  statutory rates and enacted tax rules  including transfer pricing 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis 
we believe our tax positions  including intercompany transfer pricing policies  are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
it is possible that these positions may be challenged which may have an impact on our effective tax rate 
restructuring charges during previous years  we have recorded restructuring charges as we rationalized operations in light of customer demand declines and the economic downturn 
these measures  which included major changes in senior management  workforce reduction  facilities consolidation and changes to the strategic focus of a number of sites  were largely intended to align our capacity and infrastructure to anticipate customer demand and to transition our operations to lower cost regions 
the restructuring charges include employee severance and benefit costs  write offs of property and equipment and costs related to leased facilities vacated and subleased 
severance and benefit costs and other costs associated with restructuring activities were recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  sfas 
we also record severance and benefit costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 employer s accounting for post employment benefits  sfas  as we conclude that a we have a substantive post employment benefit obligation that is attributed to prior services rendered  b rights to those benefits have vested  and c payment is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the current accounting for restructuring costs requires us to record provisions and charges when we have a formal and committed restructuring plan 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of original estimates 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring and other plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment  sfas r 
this statement requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment 
table of contents transactions be recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
in march  the securities and exchange commission sec released sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab no 

sab no 
provides the sec s staff s position regarding the application of sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations  and also provides the staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
we adopted sfas r  utilizing the modified prospective method and will continue to evaluate the impact of sfas r on our operating results and financial condition 
our assessment of the estimated compensation charges is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impacts 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
see note stock based compensation of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes merton option valuation model and the assumptions discussed in note  stock based compensation  of the consolidated financial statements 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on a combination of historical and implied volatilities  consistent with sfas r and sec sab no 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we relied exclusively on the historical prices of our common stock in the calculation of expected volatility 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the black scholes merton option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes merton option valuation model 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
for options granted before november   we estimated the fair value using the multiple option approach and we are amortizing the fair value on a graded vesting basis 
for options granted on or after november   we estimate the fair value using a single option approach and amortize the fair value on a straight line basis 
all options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes merton option valuation model in the future if our current experience indicates that a different measure is preferable  which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share 
on november   the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas r transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards fsp r 
we adopted the alternative transition method provided in the fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas r in fiscal year the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas r 
the adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition

net sales 
net sales consist of revenues from systems sales  upgrades  spare parts sales  maintenance contracts and lease income 
net sales increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase in net sales was due primarily to increased demand of our analog mixed signal products 
furthermore  net sales have increased as our products gained market acceptance 
the increase in net sales was offset by a decrease of net sales of our memory products as a result of our decision to shift resources away from the development of our next generation memory product in the third quarter of fiscal year sustainability of our revenue levels is dependent upon the economic and geopolitical climate as well as other risks described under the title risk factors herein 
we anticipate net sales will be million to million for the first quarter of fiscal year our net sales by product line in fiscal years and consisted of soc analog mixed signal memory design characterization group service total for the fiscal year  net sales from our soc and analog mixed signal net sales increased to million representing an increase of from million from the same period of fiscal the increase in net sales was offset by a decrease in net sales of our memory products from million in fiscal year to million during fiscal year furthermore  our net sales for diagnostics and characterization products for the fiscal year decreased to million from million during fiscal year international net sales accounted for approximately of total net sales in both fiscal years and our net sales to the asia pacific region accounted for approximately and of total net sales in 
table of contents fiscal years and  respectively 
the demand for automated test and engineering capital equipment in asian markets historically has been highly volatile  and in some asian regions there has been geopolitical unrest  both of which have resulted in economic instabilities 
these potential economic instabilities could materially adversely affect demand for our products 
gross margin 
our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including manufacturing efficiencies  excess and obsolete inventory write downs  sell through of previously written down inventory  pricing by competitors or suppliers  new product introductions  product sales mix  production volume  customization and reconfiguration of systems  international and domestic sales mix and field service margins 
our gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal year from for fiscal year gross margin for the fiscal year increased due to improved manufacturing efficiencies resulting from the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities offset by inventory write downs charges of million attributable to decreased demand for our memory and other legacy products as compared to inventory write downs charges of million in fiscal year in addition  the stock based compensation expense of million related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases under sfas r was charged to costs of good sold in fiscal year our gross margin benefited by approximately million or and million or from the sale of fully reserved inventory during the fiscal years ended october  and  respectively

we believe gross margin percent could be flat to slightly higher in the first quarter of fiscal year compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year research and development 
research and development  or r d  expenses were million in fiscal year  compared to million in the prior fiscal year  a decrease of 
the decrease in r d expenses in fiscal year was primarily attributable to a decrease in compensation expense of approximately million due to previous headcount reductions and a decrease in travel expenses of million partially offset by accelerated new product development investment costs of approximately million 
in addition  stock based compensation expense of million related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases under sfas r was charged to r d in fiscal year r d expenses as a percentage of net sales were and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in r d expenses as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributable to lower r d expenses and higher net sales during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year we anticipate that r d expenses in absolute dollars will be lower in the first quarter of fiscal year compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses were million in fiscal year  compared to million in the prior fiscal year  a decrease of

the decrease in sg a expenses was offset by an increase in compensation expense of million  an increase in maintenance contract expenses of million  an increase in postage and other general expenses of million and an increase in stock based compensation expense of million related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases under sfas r charged to sg a in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses were and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributable to lower sg a expenses coupled with higher net sales levels during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year we expect sg a expenses in absolute dollars will be lower in the first quarter of fiscal year compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 
table of contents amortization of purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation 
amortization of purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation expenses were million in fiscal year  compared to million in the prior fiscal year  a decrease of 
upon the adoption of sfas r  we discontinued the amortization of our deferred stock compensation  which was approximately million in fiscal year of the million recorded in fiscal year  amortization of purchased intangibles was million 
the decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets in fiscal year from fiscal year was due primarily to certain purchased intangible assets including trademark  purchase product backlog  patents and non compete agreements that became fully amortized during fiscal year remaining estimated annual amortization expense for purchased intangible assets is expected to be million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
reduction of goodwill 
effective november   we adopted sfas  which was issued by the fasb in july under this standard  we ceased amortizing goodwill effective november  it is required that we test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis and at any other time if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  a significant change in direction with respect to investment in a product or market segment  the likelihood that a significant portion of the business will be sold or disposed of  or the results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit determined in accordance with sfas the impairment test for goodwill involves a two step process step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the fair value  step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss 
the determination as to whether a write down of goodwill is necessary involves significant judgment based on short term and long term projections of our operations 
the assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  discount rates and terminal growth rates  reflect our best estimates 
based on a combination of factors that came into existence and were identified during the third quarter of fiscal year  particularly our changed current and projected operating results reflecting lower demand from major customers  and our current market capitalization which was less than our book value for the preceding weeks prior to the end of the third quarter  we concluded there were sufficient indicators to require us to assess whether any portion of our recorded goodwill balance was impaired 
we concluded based on our estimates  forecasted discounted cash flows  as well as our market capitalization  that our goodwill was impaired at july  further analysis indicated that goodwill impairment charges of million were necessary in the third quarter of fiscal year other long lived assets were assessed for impairment prior to the performance of the sfas analysis and were determined not to be impaired 
we performed the first step of the interim sfas no 
analysis  consisting of a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with our carrying amount  including the goodwill 
the fair value was determined based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows  and market approach  which estimates the fair value based on market prices of comparable companies 
under the income approach  we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of years  long term annual growth rates of to  a discount rate of and terminal value growth rates of 
we also considered our total market capitalization as of july   and our average market capitalization for the quarter in order 
table of contents to assess volatility of our market capitalization on that day 
based on the first step of the analysis  we determined that the carrying amount was in excess of its fair value 
as such  we were required to perform the second step analysis to determine the amount of the impairment loss 
the second step of the analysis consisted of comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill  with an impairment charge resulting from any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill based on a hypothetical allocation of the estimated fair value of the company to the company s tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill 
based on the second step of the analysis  we concluded that all of our recorded goodwill million was impaired and as such recorded a noncash charge to continuing operations during the third quarter of fiscal year restructuring charges 
in fiscal year  we recorded total restructuring charges of approximately million 
the restructuring charges were for severance expenses related to headcount reduction  facilities  fixed assets write off and other liabilities related to the discontinuance of our memory product and overall alignment of our corporate strategy 
of the million  approximately million was for severance and other related charges which accounted for a headcount reduction of approximately employees 
the affected employees were across all business functions throughout the world 
the discontinuation of our memory product generated approximately million and million charges related to contract cancellation and write down of our property and equipment  respectively 
in fiscal year  we recorded total restructuring charges of approximately million 
of the million  million was for severance and other related charges which accounted for a headcount reduction of employees 
of the million  the amount recorded under fas at october  was million 
the affected employees were primarily in research and development and selling general and administrative functions throughout the world 
write off of property and equipment of million resulted from our decision to halt additional research and development investment in one of our products that was rendered redundant by the acquisition of nptest 
operating lease and leasehold restoration charges of million  which are net of expected sublease rentals  resulted from vacating the former nptest headquarters facilities in san jose 
outsource it contract cancellation charges amounted to million 
these charges were offset by deferred rent write off of million and prior accrual adjustment of million  primarily related to severance and related charges 
see note restructuring charges  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
interest income 
we generated interest income of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal year was primarily due to higher interest rates compared to fiscal year  partially offset by lower cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year interest expense 
interest expense was million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
interest expense in fiscal years and primarily represents interest on our convertible debt

other income  net was  and million in fiscal years and  respectively  a decline of million 
the change to other income in fiscal year from other net income in fiscal year was primarily due to the mark up to fair value of an acquired liability in fiscal year of million owed to the former parent of nptest  an unfavorable change in foreign currency valuation from fiscal year to fiscal year of approximately million and the write off of impaired equity investment of million and higher loss on disposal of fixed assets of approximately million during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year these were offset by a gain of million in the convertible bonds buy back and a gain on the sale of an equity investment of million in fiscal year the acquired liability was settled during the third quarter of fiscal year for a total settlement value of million

table of contents income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the income tax expense for the periods consists primarily of foreign tax expense on earnings generated from our foreign operations 
at october   we had unused net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire in through at october   we also had unused foreign tax credits of million related to the singapore repatriation  which expires in utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will be subject to annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitations may result in expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before full utilization 
realization of the net deferred tax assets is dependent on our generating sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain reversals of temporary differences  net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
our net deferred tax asset balance as of october  was million which relates to taxable income generated at our foreign subsidiaries 
our domestic tax assets reflect a full valuation allowance due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income and our corresponding ability to utilize our deferred tax assets 
until such time  we do not expect to recognize any significant tax benefits in our results of operations 
stock options and incentive plan we have a stock based compensation program that provides our board of directors broad discretion in creating employee equity incentives 
this program includes incentive and non statutory stock options granted under various plans  the majority of which are stockholder approved 
stock options are generally time based  vesting on each annual anniversary of the hire date over four years and expire seven years from the grant date 
additionally  we have an employee stock purchase plan espp that allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at of the fair market value at the lower of either the date of enrollment or the date of purchase 
shares issued as a result of stock option exercises and our espp are generally from our new or treasury shares 
as of october   we had approximately million shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under the stock option plans and espp 
on november   we adopted the provision of statement of financial accounting standard no 
r sfas r  share based payment  for our share based compensation plans 
under sfas r  we are required to recognize stock based compensation costs based on the estimated fair value at the grant date for our share based awards 
we previously accounted for our employee stock option and employee espp under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  and adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas  as amended by statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosures  sfas 
we elected to use the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas r  and therefore  have not restated our financial results for prior periods 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r  we changed our method of attributing the value of stock based compensation to expense from the accelerated multiple option approach to the straight line single option method 
compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted prior to november  will continue to be recognized using the accelerated multiple option approach while compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted on or subsequent to november  is recognized using the straight line single option approach 
as a result of adopting sfas r  our losses before income taxes and net loss for the fiscal year was million higher than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb basic 
table of contents and diluted net loss per share for the fiscal year  would have been lower if we were able to continue to follow apb accounting 
there was no effect on the consolidated statements of cash flows from adopting sfas r 
in august  our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of certain unvested and out of the money non qualified stock options previously awarded to employees and officers with option exercise prices equal to or greater than 
options held by non employee directors were excluded from the vesting acceleration 
in addition  in order to prevent executive officers from unintended personal benefits  our executive officers agreed to the imposition of restrictions on any shares received through the exercise of accelerated options 
those restrictions prevent the sale of any shares received from the exercise of an accelerated option until the earlier of the original vesting date of the option or the executive officer s termination of employment 
the price was selected because it was higher than the closing price of our common stock of on august   the date of this acceleration 
the accelerated options represented approximately or approximately million shares of the total of all outstanding options on august  the acceleration was intended to reduce the stock option expense we would be required to record after the adoption of sfas r 
this acceleration reduced approximately million of stock option expenses under sfas r which would have been recognized as an expense through december at october   there was million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to non vested options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
at october   there was million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to outstanding espp shares that is expected to be recognized over a four month period

net sales 
net sales decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year for the fiscal year ended october   net sales from our soc and dcg product lines and service increased to million from million in fiscal year this increase resulted primarily from the may acquisition of nptest  but also represented the increasing acceptance of the sapphire and dcg tools as well as an increase in our installed base of systems 
net sales from our analog mixed signal and memory products declined to million during the fiscal year ended october  from million during the same period of fiscal year the decline results from the cyclically low demand in these markets  particularly for the memory products which are directed at the nor memory group 
the decline was softened somewhat by improved volumes for the analog mixed signal products in the second half of fiscal year international net sales accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal year and  respectively 
our net sales to the asia pacific region accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal year and  respectively 
our net sales by product line in fiscal year and consisted of soc analog mixed signal memory diagnostics and characterization group service and other total 
table of contents gross margin 
our gross margin as a percentage of net sales remained at for fiscal year and gross margin in fiscal year was affected by million related to the write down of kalos ii inventory due to our decision to invest in the next generation memory product as well as to lack of demand  obsolete revisions of sapphire inventory resulting from our decision to market sapphire as our sole solution for the high end soc market and excess and obsolete octet and vanguard ii inventory and assets due to our decision to discontinue significant future investment in these redundant product lines stemming from the acquisition of nptest 
gross margin in fiscal year was affected by million related to the write down of obsolete octet and quartet inventory and assets  again due to our decision to discontinue significant future investment in these redundant product lines stemming from the acquisition of nptest 
gross margin declined from fiscal year to fiscal year principally because we replaced higher margin analog mixed signal and memory revenues with somewhat lower margin sapphire revenues 
the decline was less than it otherwise might have been because of the efficiencies gained when we consolidated our three principal manufacturing facilities into one in the second and third fiscal quarter of in addition  during the fiscal year ended october  and  our gross margin benefited by approximately and  respectively  from the sale of fully reserved inventory 
research and development 
research and development  or r d  expenses were million in fiscal year  compared to million in the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
the increase in spending in fiscal year resulted primarily from the significant resources invested in the development of new products and product enhancements of approximately million offset by a million decrease in bonuses earned and a million decline in licenses fees 
r d expenses as a percentage of net sales were and in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
the increase in r d expenses as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributable to higher r d expenses as well as lower net sales during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses were million in fiscal year  compared to million in the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to activities resulting from the acquisition of nptest in may  including an increase in integration expense of million  an increase in product consignment expense of million due to the number of sapphire systems consigned and an increase in compensation costs of million 
in addition  we incurred approximately million of costs associated with our sarbanes oxley compliance program  expenses related to salaries  consulting and audit fees 
these increases were offset by a decrease in marketing spending of million  a decrease in distributors and sales person commissions of million  a decrease in other variable compensation of million and decrease in fringe benefits costs of million 
these decreases were caused by the decrease in net sales as well as a focused effort to decrease spending 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses were and in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
the increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributable to a full year of nptest and associated integration spending in fiscal year versus five months in fiscal year as well as lower sales levels during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year amortization of purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation 
amortization of purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation expenses were million in fiscal year  compared to million in the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
amortization of purchased intangible assets was higher in fiscal year due primarily to the acquisition of nptest in may restructuring charges 
in fiscal year  we recorded total restructuring charges of approximately million 
of the million  million was for severance and other related charges which accounted for a headcount reduction of employees 
of the million  the amount recorded under sfas at october  was million 
the affected employees were primarily in research and development and selling  general and administrative functions throughout the world 
write off of property and equipment of million resulted from our decision to halt additional research and development investment in one of our products that was rendered redundant by the acquisition of nptest 
operating lease and leasehold restoration charges of 
table of contents million  which are net of expected sublease rentals  resulted from vacating the former nptest headquarters facilities in san jose 
outsource it contract cancellation charges amounted to million 
these charges were offset by a deferred rent write off of million and a prior accrual adjustment of million  primarily related to severance and related charges 
see note restructuring charges  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
interest income 
we generated interest income of million and million in fiscal year and  respectively 
the decline from fiscal year was primarily due to lower average investment balances in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year offset by a higher average interest rate 
interest expense 
interest expenses were million and million in fiscal year and  respectively 
the interest expense in fiscal years and was primarily attributable to interest expense related to the convertible subordinated notes that we issued in june other income and expenses  net 
other income  net was million and million in fiscal year and  respectively  a decline of million 
the decrease in other income  net  from fiscal year to was primarily due to the fair value adjustment of an acquired liability owed to the former parent of nptest  schlumberger limited schlumberger 
this liability was settled during the third quarter of fiscal year for a total settlement value of million 
as of october   this liability was million 
see note acquisitions  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the income tax expense for the period consisted of net us current income tax expense of million and foreign tax expense on earnings and foreign withholding taxes of million generated from our foreign operations 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used for operating activities during fiscal year was million 
the primary use of this cash resulted from a net loss of million 
the use of cash was offset by reduction of goodwill of million  depreciation and amortization of million  non cash charges related to inventory write downs and restructuring charges of million  stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases under sfas r of million  and impairment of an equity investment of million 
the net cash used in operating activities was offset in part by the increases in net changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
investing activities used net cash of approximately million in fiscal year  primarily attributable to cash used of million to purchase available for sale securities  million used to acquire hypervision and million to purchase property and equipment to support our business 
net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by sales and maturities of available for sale securities of million  proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of million which mainly reflected the sale of surplus land located in oregon and proceeds from the sales of our equity investment of million 
financing activities used net cash of million in fiscal year  primarily attributed to the repurchase of our convertible subordinated notes with a maturity date of may of million  payment of bank loan of million  partially offset by cash provided from the issuance of common stock related to our employee equity plans of million 
in august  we implemented a plan to repatriate cash 
in october  we repatriated approximately million in unremitted foreign earnings 

table of contents in august  our board of directors authorized our management to repurchase debt not to exceed million in principal amount in partial or full tranches based on available cash and market conditions during the fourth quarter of fiscal year as of october   we had repurchased million of the outstanding convertible subordinated notes with a maturity date of may for million in cash 
on december   we completed the exchange in an aggregate principal amount of million of our convertible subordinated notes due in may for a new series of convertible senior subordinated notes due in may  as well as the issuance of new convertible senior subordinated notes the new notes with an aggregate principal amount of million 
the new notes contain provisions known as net share settlement which required that  upon conversion of the new notes  we will pay holders in cash for up to the principal amount of the converted new notes 
any amount in excess of this cash will be settled in shares of our common stock  or at our option  cash 
as of october   we had working capital of approximately million  including cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  and accounts receivable and inventories totaling million 
we believe that because of the relatively long manufacturing cycles of many of our testers and the new products we presently offer and plan to introduce  investments in inventories will also continue to represent a significant portion of our working capital 
the semiconductor industry has historically been highly cyclical and has experienced downturns  which have had a material adverse effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for automatic test equipment  including equipment manufactured and marketed by us 
in addition  the automatic test equipment industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
events related to these factors may occur in the near term  which would cause a change to our estimate of the net realizable value of receivables  inventories or other assets  and the adequacy of accrued liabilities 
we believe our current cash and investment positions will be sufficient to meet our anticipated business requirements for the next months 
we lease some of our facilities and equipment under operating leases that expire through the approximate future minimum lease payments at october  are as follows in thousands committed gross lease payments leases written off in restructuring charges net estimated future lease expense thereafter the leases written off in special charges of million are accounted for in our accrued expenses and other liabilities balance on the consolidated balance sheets at october

this amount is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as convertible subordinated notes 
some of the components that we purchase are unique to us and must be purchased in relatively high minimum quantities with long four and five month lead times 
these purchases can lead us to holding relatively high inventory levels and associated risks 
in addition  purchase commitments for unique components are relatively inflexible in terms of deferral or cancellation 
at october   we had open and committed non cancelable purchase orders totaling approximately million 
the contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at october  under these arrangements and others 
actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided 
in addition to minimum spending commitments  certain of these arrangements provide for potential cancellation charges 
as of october   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 exchanges of non monetary assets  sfas  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas addresses the measurement of exchanges of non monetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions that should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged

 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
table of contents sfas  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
however  the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
fin requires that the uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists

 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
under this pronouncement changes are required to be retrospectively applied to prior financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
retrospective application means the application of a different accounting principle to prior accounting periods as if that principle had always been used or as the adjustment of previously issued financial statements to reflect a change in the reporting entity 
this statement addresses restatement of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
this statement requires that the retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
this statement also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and investment portfolio 
we maintain a strict investment policy  which ensures the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
our investments consist primarily of commercial paper  medium term notes  asset backed securities  united states treasury notes and obligations of united states government agencies  bank certificates of deposit  auction rate preferred securities  corporate bonds and municipal bonds 
the table below presents notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio in thousands  except percent amounts 
future maturities of investments held at october  balance october  balance october  thereafter cash equivalents amounts average rate investments amounts average rate total investment average rate equity instruments 
table of contents we mitigate default risk by attempting to invest in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and maintains a prudent amount of diversification 
the sensitivity analysis model used by us for interest rate exposure compares interest income on current investment interest rates versus current investment levels at current interest rates with a increase 
based on this model  a increase or decrease would result in an increase or a decrease in interest income of approximately  there can be no assurances that the above projected interest rate increase will materialize 
fluctuations of interest rates are beyond our control 
foreign exchange we generate a significant portion of our sales from customers located outside the united states  principally in asia and to a lesser extent europe 
international sales are made mostly to foreign distributors and some foreign subsidiaries and are typically denominated in us dollars  but occasionally are denominated in the local currency for european and japanese customers 
the subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
our sz product line is developed and manufactured in germany and  thus  those expenses are euro based 
accordingly  some of our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
for the fiscal years ended october  and  we recorded foreign currency losses of million and foreign currency gains of million  respectively 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
we do not currently use derivatives  but will continue to assess the need for these instruments in the future 
interest rate risk our convertible subordinated notes with a maturity date of may bear interest at a fixed rate of  and therefore changes in interest rates do not impact our interest expense on this debt  likewise  the financing that took place in december we  from time to time  have outstanding short term borrowings with variable interest rates 
the total average amount of these borrowings outstanding annually has been insignificant 
therefore  we expect that a change in interest rate will not have any material effect on our interest expense
