item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
recent developments in march   daxor finished the final phase  which was the inspection part  to receive ul underwriters laboratory approval 
the process consisted of daxor submitting the complete bva and associated panel pc for physical inspection and testing  including the strenuous electrical inspection safety examination 
blood volume analyzers shipped in april should bear the ul mark 
daxor is in the process of achieving the ce mark 
ce is a self certification mark for which the manufacturer must possess proof of compliance with the standards 
daxor s immediate goal is to pass the us and canadian standards for ce 
as part of the ul testing  daxor has passed the electrical safety part and possesses its verification from the ul for this component 
the second component is emc electro magnetic compatibility 
this test only takes a few days and should be completed by the end of april  for daxor to be able to market and distribute the instrument in countries other than the us and canada  it would need to pass those country s specific requirements  which may or many not have been met by the emc and electrical testing 
most of the time countries require the existing documentation that daxor provides with the bva to be translated into the country s specific language 
during fiscal years and  daxor made major changes in the blood volume analyzer 
it expanded its research and development staff see r d section page 
in january   it hired  on a permanent basis  the employees of tennessee valley software  and leased a second site in oak ridge  tennessee 
because of the ongoing changes the company will be first ready to obtain an underwriters laboratories and a ce mark which is required for marketing in europe in the second quarter of the company has also recognized that it needs to expand research projects that will provide validation on a cost benefit basis for the blood volume analyzer 
in year  the company obtained new equipment approved by the fda which enables frozen blood to be used for up to days after thawing 
the company has purchased this equipment and has been testing it for the past year using purchased blood 
the company is in the process of negotiating with several hospitals for a blood optimization program which will enable individuals to freeze their own blood months in advance of surgery see sections in blood banking pages and 
this program is coupled with the use of the blood volume analyzer so as to prevent patients from donating excessive amounts of blood and entering surgery in a blood depleted state 
because of the company s limited resources  the company will devote a larger portion of its efforts towards the blood volume analyzer 
daxor has continued to expand its research and marketing staff 
the company intends to increase its marketing efforts to add to its operational income 
some of the steps the company has undertaken include consolidating certain manufacturing facilities at oak ridge  tennessee 
in january of the company completed the purchase of a  square foot facility which will enable it to expand its research and development activities  as well as engage in expanded manufacturing 
the company s goal will be to increase operating revenues even if this initially results in increasing losses 
results of operations operating revenues in revenue from operations was  vs 
revenue from operations of  for an increase of 
in  operating revenues were  equipment sales and kit sales increased from  in to  in in the company sold two blood volume analyzers for a total of  versus one in for  kit sales increased by in over and by in over kit sales increased by in over and by in over  patients  utilizing the bva  had blood volume measurements in vs 
 in   in and  in there are two major reasons for this increase in kit sales 
one reason for the increase in kit sales is that there are blood volume analyzers placed at december  versus placed at december  the second reason is that during medicaire made an incorrect analysis of the cost for the radiopharmaceutical kit  volumex which is used in conjunction with the bva blood volume analyzer 
this error was brought to the attention of appropriate officials late in and corrected in the beginning of this had a negative impact on the company s ability to obtain bva trial agreements and to convert these agreements into sales 
as a result of this medicare issue  the company has extended the trial period for a number of hospitals so that they are better able to evaluate the benefits of the bva blood volume analyzer 
the following table provides gross margin information on equipment sales related services for the years ended december  and december  kit sales kit sales year ended december  equipment sales and other year ended december  total year ended december  total year ended december  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit loss gross profit loss percentage there were twenty trial agreements signed for the bva blood volume analyzer during the year ended december  versus fourteen in the year ended december  the increased interest in the instrument is directly attributable to the reinstatement of the medicaire reimbursement for volumex 
trial agreements on a clinical basis require the hospitals to pay for the kits they use while they have the equipment on a trial basis 
the only exceptions are those facilities who are conducting research utilizing the bva and therefore  the company has agreed to supply those volumex doses free of charge this includes the shipping costs and all disposables associated with the study 
operating revenues from cryobanking and related services decreased in by  or from this was due mainly to a onetime receipt of royalty income of  in this royalty income stemmed from the sale of a one time use of the cryobanking technology of idant laboratories 
for the year ended december   revenue from semen storage decreased by  or to  versus  in the year ended december  there was also a decrease of  in semen analysis and other lab services 
the company s idant laboratories subsidiary contributed   and of operating revenues in  and respectively 
operating expenses the increase in operating expenses for  and was due to additional hiring in each year of sales and marketing personnel for the blood volume analyzer and costs of expanded research and development efforts 
for  expenses from operations totaled  and the loss from operations was  in  expenses from operations totaled  the loss from operations was  in  expenses from operations totaled  the loss from operations totaled total operating costs for daxor and the bva segment were  for the year ended december  versus  for the year ended december  for an increase of  or 
research and development expenses for daxor and the bva segment increased in by  or to  from  in daxor is committed to making blood volume analysis a standard of care in at least three disease states 
in order to achieve this goal  we are continuing to spend time and money in research and development in order to get the best product to market 
we are still working on the following three projects gfr glomeril filtration rate  total body albumin analysis  and wipe tests for radiation contamination and detection 
we are also progressing on the next version of the delivery device for the radioactive dose volumex 
the current version is the max which has a patent 
the next version  the max will be without a needle and should give the company extended protection with a second patent when it is completed 
total operating costs for the cryobanking segment were  for the year ended december  versus  for the year ended december  for a decrease of  or 
the major reason for this decrease is the decline in storage revenue which resulted in a reduced need for related expenditures 
the company had a major change in its blood volume analyzer see research and development page 
the company intends to continue to expand its research and development efforts as well as its marketing efforts 
the company anticipated these increased operating expenses and intends to continue expanding its research and marketing staff 
the company experienced the largest operating loss in its history 
these losses were only partially offset by investment company income 
the company has expanded its research staff in oak ridge  tennessee and previously had a pilot manufacturing facility 
in january of the company completed the purchase of a  square foot facility  including acres of land 
this provides an opportunity for expansion 
the company selected the town of oak ridge  tennessee because of its long history and association with radio isotopic facilities and its local pool of talent in this area 
there are only a few sites in the united states which could provide this combination of expertise and community acceptance of nuclear medicine 
although the radio isotopes involved in daxor s facility are extremely low  there is  nevertheless  an irrational fear in many communities of any manufacturing facilities associated with medical radio isotopes 
dividend income dividend income earned on the company s securities portfolio was  in vs 
 in  for a decrease of  or 
this is mainly due to a one time special dividend of  received in as the result of a utility company merger 
during the year ended december   the company received dividends of  on stocks that were no longer in the portfolio at the end of the year 
in  dividend income was  investment gains gains on the sale of investments were  in vs 
 in  and  in the sum of dividend income plus investment gain from sale of securities was  in   in  and  in 
liquidity and capital resources the company s management has pursued a policy of maintaining sufficient liquidity and capital resources in order to assure continued availability of necessary funds for the viability and projected growth of all ongoing projects 
at december   the company had  in short term debt vs 
 in the following amounts are included in short term debt at december  and december  deferred tax liability of  and  respectively  and securities borrowed at fair market value of  and  the deferred tax liability represents taxes due on the unrealized gain of the investment portfolio and securities borrowed at fair market value represent short positions in common stock 
at year end  stockholders equity was  at year end vs 
total shareholder equity was  at year end at december  the company s security portfolio had a market value of  vs 
 in in  the company s total liabilities and stockholders equity were  vs 
 in starting february   the company made the first monthly mortgage payment of  which includes principal and interest for the properties purchased at and meco lane  oak ridge  tennessee 
this monthly amount is due to paid through december  there is a balloon payment of  due on january  for the remaining principal and interest 
the company has the option of making this payment or refinancing the mortgage for an additional five year term at a fixed rate of interest that would be set on january  income from the company s security portfolio is a major asset for the company as it expands its research and marketing staff 
at december   the company is in a satisfactory financial position with adequate funds available for its immediate and anticipated needs 
the company plans its budgetary outlays on the assumption that the raising of additional financial capital may be difficult in the next to years 
the company believes that its present liquidity and assets are adequate to sustain the additional expenses associated with an expanding sales and marketing program 
the following table shows the cost  market value  net unrealized gain  unrealized gain and loss at december st from through these issues are further discussed under item a  quantitative and qualitative discussions about market risk 
valuation date cost fair market value net unrealized gain unrealized gains unrealized losses december  december  december  december  december  the company s invested capital has remained relatively unchanged over the past years  varying from  in to  in the value of the company s investments increased from  in to  during this year period 
the company has been able to partially offset the continuing operating losses which in were the highest in the company s history 
the increase in value of the company s assets provides an underpinning for the company s expanding activities 
while there can be no assurance that these assets will not decrease in value  it is unlikely  at the present time  that they will go back to historical cost 
the company feels  however  that with respect to the blood volume analyzer and the blood optimization program  it is undercapitalized 
recent inquiries have indicated that additional capital is not available on reasonable terms without great dilution to existing shareholders 
the company believes that if the blood volume analyzer becomes a standard of care in any one of the areas described in this k filing  it will then have much easier access to additional capital 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss the company s condensed consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the company considers the following accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
available for sale securities available for sale securities represent investments in debt and equity securities primarily common and preferred stock of utility companies that management has determined meet the definition of available for sale under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
accordingly  these investments are stated at fair market value and all unrealized holding gains or losses are recorded in the stockholders equity section as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
conversely  all realized gains  losses and earnings are recorded in the statement of operations under other income expense 
the company will also engage in the short selling of stock 
when this occurs  the short position is marked to the market and this adjustment is recorded in the statement of operations 
any gain or loss is recorded for the period presented historical cost is used by the company to determine all gains and losses  and fair market value is obtained by readily available market quotes on all securities 
the company s investment goals  strategies and policies are as follows the company s investment goals are capital preservation and maintaining returns on this capital with a high degree of safety 
the company maintains a diversified securities portfolio comprised primarily of electric utility preferred and common stocks 
the company also sells covered calls on portions of its portfolio and also sells puts on stocks it is willing to own 
it also sells uncovered calls and will engage in short position up to of the value of its portfolio 
the company s short position may temporarily rise to of the company s portfolio without any specific action because of changes in valuation  but should not exceed this amount 
the company s investment policy is to maintain a minimum of of its portfolio in electric utilities 
investments in utilities are primarily in electric companies 
investments in non utility stocks will not exceed of the portfolio 
investment in speculative issues  including short sales  maximum of limited use of options to increase yearly investment income 
a 
the use of call options 
covered options can be sold up to a maximum of of the value of the portfolio 
this provides extra income in addition to dividends received from the company s investments 
the risk of this strategy is that investments the company may have preferred to retain can be called away 
therefore  a limitation of is placed on the amount of stock on which options which can be written 
the amount of the portfolio on which options are actually written is usually between of the portfolio 
the actual turnover of the portfolio is such that the average holding period is in excess of years for available for sale securities 
b 
the use of put options 
put options are written on stocks which the company is willing to purchase 
while the company does not have a high rate of turnover in its portfolio  there is some turnover  for example  due to preferred stocks being called back by the issuing company  or stocks being called away because call options have been written 
if the stock does not go below the put exercise price  the company records the proceeds from the sale as income 
if the put is exercised  the cost basis is reduced by the proceeds received from the sale of the put option 
there may be occasions where the cost basis of the stock is lower than the market price at the time the option is exercised 
c 
speculative short sales short options 
the company limits its speculative transactions to no more than of the value of the portfolio 
the company may sell uncovered calls on certain stocks 
if the stock price does not rise to the price of the calls  the option is not exercised  and the company records the proceeds from the sale of the call as income 
if the call is exercised  the company will have a short position in the related stock 
the company then has the choice of covering the short position or selling a put against it 
if the put is exercised  the short position is covered 
the company s current accounting policy is to mark to the market at the end of each quarter any short positions  and include it in the income statement 
while the company may have so called speculative positions equal to of its accounts  in actual practice the average short stock positions usually account for less than of the assets of the company 
in the event of a merger  the company will elect to receive shares in the new company 
in the event of a cash only offer  the company will receive cash and be forced to sell its stock 
the income derived from these investments has been essential to offset the research  operating and marketing expenses of developing the blood volume analyzer 
the company has followed a conservative policy of assuring adequate liquidity so that it can expand its marketing and research development without the sudden necessity of raising additional capital 
the securities in the company s portfolio are selected to provide stability of both income and capital 
the company has been able to achieve financial stability because of these returns  which covered a significant portion of the company s continuing losses from operations 
the company s investment policy is reviewed at least once yearly by the board of directors and the audit committee  who vote upon the policy 
individual investment decisions are made solely by dr 
joseph feldschuh  ceo  who devotes approximately to of his time  or to hours per week to this activity 
he is assisted by a single part time employee 
no other member of the company is involved in individual investment decisions 
revenue recognition the company recognizes operational revenues from several sources 
the first source is the outright sale of equipment  the blood volume analyzer  to customers 
the second source is the sale and associated shipping revenues of single use radioisotope doses volumex that are injected into the patient and measured by the blood volume analyzer 
the third source of revenue is service contracts on the blood volume analyzer  after it has been sold to a customer 
the fourth source of revenue is the storage fees associated with cryobanked blood and semen specimens 
the fifth is lab revenues from laboratory services  and the sixth is revenue from semen sales 
the company currently offers three different methods of purchasing the blood volume analyzer equipment 
a customer may purchase the equipment directly  lease the equipment  or rent the equipment on a month to month basis 
the revenues generated by a direct sale or a monthly rental are recognized as revenue in the period in which the sale or rental occurred 
if a customer is to select the lease option  the company refers its customer to a third party finance company with which it has established a relationship  and if the lease is approved  the company receives of the sales proceeds from the finance company and recognizes of the revenue 
the finance company then deals directly with the customer with regard to lease payments and related collections 
daxor corporation does not guarantee payments to the leasing company 
the sales of the single use radioisotope doses volumex that are used in conjunction with the blood volume analyzer are recognized as revenue in the period in which the sale occurred 
when blood volume analyzer equipment has been sold to a customer  the company offers a one year warranty on the product  which covers all mechanical failures 
this one year warranty is effective on the date of sale of the equipment 
after the one year period expires  customers may purchase a service contract through the company  which is usually offered in one year  three year or five year increments 
prior to q  these service contracts were recorded by the company as deferred revenue and were amortized into income in the period in which they apply 
currently  all service contracts  regardless of length of term  are billed quarterly in the period in which the revenue is earned 
the storage fees associated with the cryobanked blood and semen samples are recognized as income in the period for which the fee applies 
the company invoices customers for storage fees for various time periods 
these time periods range from one month up to one  two or three years 
the company will only recognize revenue for those storage fees that are earned in the current reporting period  and will defer the remaining revenues to the period in which they are earned 
effective october   the company has altered our billing procedure as such that clients will only be billed on a quarterly basis 
therefore  future revenue recognition will not include deferred revenue on the storage fees  but rather will be earned in the same period in which the invoices are generated 
comprehensive income loss the company reports components of comprehensive income under the requirements of sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
this statement establishes rules for the reporting of comprehensive income and requires certain transactions to be presented as separate components of stockholders equity 
the company currently reports the unrealized holding gains and losses on available for sale securities  net of deferred taxes  as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
product warrantees and related liabilities the company offers a one year warranty on the blood volume analyzer equipment 
this warranty is effective on the date of sale and covers all mechanical failures of the equipment 
all major components of the equipment are purchased and warranted by the original rd party manufacturers 
once the initial one year warranty period has expired  customers may purchase annual service contracts for the equipment 
these service contracts warranty the mechanical failures of the equipment that are not associated with normal wear and tear of the components 
to date  the company has not experienced any major mechanical failures on any equipment sold 
in addition  the majority of the potential liability would revert to the original manufacturer 
due to this history  a liability has not been recorded with respect to product warranty liability 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the results of operations during the reporting periods 
although these estimates are based upon management s best knowledge of current events and actions  actual results could differ from those estimates income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this pronouncement requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of event attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the statement of operations in the period in which the enactment rate changes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance at such time as  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
contractual obligations in december  the company signed a lease which commenced on january   for its existing facility at the empire state building 
the lease expires on december  the company has occupied this space since january the company currently occupies approximately  square feet 
there are options for an additional  square feet of space 
the company has a pilot manufacturing facility in oak ridge  tennessee which is currently manufacturing the bva blood volume analyzers  and where r d activities are performed 
the company s volumex syringes are filled by an fda approved radio pharmaceutical manufacturer 
the manufacturer has worked with daxor since the manufacturer s prices are reviewed annually 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total this amount represents a total monthly rental payment of  through june   base rent of  additional space at th avenue at  rent for separate locations in oak ridge  tennessee is on a month to month basis  for a total of  per month 
the company expects to move operations in oak ridge into its facility at meco lane by july  at which time it will no longer be making the current rental payments of  per month 
from july  through december   monthly rental payment is  for the space at th avenue 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in light of the safe harbor provisions so that a company could not be considered an investment company  we have done an analysis of what would have occurred if the company had elected to use a safe harbor provision instead of the cash management program that it developed which utilizes dividend paying utilities combined with option sales 
it should be noted that it is not mandatory to utilize t bills  only that it is a safe harbor provision  where one is not required to explain or justify that one is an operating company rather than in investment company 
we elected to augment the company s revenue rather than accept the safe harbor t bill scenario 
we understood that there were risks  and the concept was approved by the board of directors of daxor before this policy was inaugurated 
the board of directors reviews and approves the investment policy at least once a year 
the current policy is the primary investments are in electric utilities  no more than of the company s assets can be in shorts at any one time  the company can continue to sell covered call options  sell naked put options on securities it is willing to own  concentration of no more than of any one stock in the portfolio  if a stock were to grow to more than due to natural increase in value  it is exempt from the concentration rule 
all individual investment decisions are made by dr 
joseph feldschuh 
dr 
feldschuh spends approximately of his time approximately hours per week on reviewing information relative to investment decisions  as well as transmitting instructions concerning these decisions 
a single half time administrative employee provides assistance to dr 
feldschuh 
no other employee is involved in investment making decisions 
the company subscribes to two independent investment economic newsletters and three financial newspapers 
the company also receives free investment analysis from the two primary brokerage houses where it has corporate accounts 
the company has always had on its board of directors  for at past the last twenty years  at least one person who could be considered an expert on investing accounting policy with wall street experience 
in  the company had a secondary offering which raised approximately million 
in  prior to clearance by the sec of the underwriting  the company had its cash management policy of investing in electric utilities reviewed by the sec 
the sec reviewed the policy and the company s operations  and permitted the secondary offering to proceed without any alterations 
in  the company had its cash management investment policies questioned by the sec and no action was taken against the company 
the following graphs illustrate what would have happened to the company if the company had chosen at that time  beginning in  to undertake a so called safe harbor policy 
two separate t bill rates were used for this analysis  one for an average rate of approximately  and one for an average rate of approximately 
the and scenarios are reasonable approximations of which the company might have encountered during this time 
during this time period t bill interest rates fluctuated between approximately and 
in november  the company s cash policy was again questioned by the sec and a formal response was provided by the company on january  the following additional information is provided to illustrate what the company s current financial position would have been had it followed a simple policy of investing its cash in t bills 
the company also is providing a graph adapted from reich tang showing t bill rates for the past years 
some of these graphs were previously provided in an amended k filed on november  the current graphs are updated to year end they also include additional information adopted from data from reich tang  a large mutual fund utilizing treasury debt to provide investment income 
graph comparison of net earnings with hypothetical earnings that would have resulted had the company invested in treasury bills from to and received a interest rate message graph illustrates three sets of data from to the company s reported net income from all sources  the company s operation income minus operating expenses  and a hypothetical net income calculated assuming that  rather than following its existing investment policy  the company had invested in treasury bills and received an interest rate of 
from to  the company reported a net profit despite increasing losses from operations 
as can be seen  from through  operating revenues did not cover expenses 
from  despite heavy operating losses  the company was close to breaking even 
in the years ended december   and  the company lost   and  despite supplemental revenue from investments 
had the company invested in treasury bills and received a interest rate  all years would have shown a loss 
from  the company would have lost approximately million each year 
in  the company would have lost nearly million  in over million  and in and over million 
graph comparison of net earnings with hypothetical earnings that would have resulted had the company invested in treasury bills from to and received a interest rate message graph shows the same basic scenario as graph  except that the hypothetical net income was calculated assuming a interest rate from treasury bills 
the results are similar to those from graph  but the loss is slightly lower because of the higher interest rate 
graph hypothetical change in company assets that would have occurred had persistent losses from investment in treasury bills with a rate of interest forced the company to cover losses by liquidating sections of its portfolio message graph compares the company s marketable securities at cost with a hypothetical value of securities 
this hypothetical value was calculated assuming that the company had begun investing in treasury bills in and received a interest rate 
the marketable securities at cost approximately represent the amount of money the company has available  or its approximate assets 
using our existing investment policy  the value of our marketable securities at cost has slowly decreased over the last years but has begun to slowly increase since on the whole  the marketable securities at cost have remained within a range of approximately million to approximately million 
had the company invested in treasury bills  because of the continuing net loss as demonstrated in graph  the company would have been forced to steadily sell investment capital to cover those losses 
the calculations take this dwindling supply of capital into account 
lost capital would only have been partially replaced by interest on the treasury bills  and the amount of investment income would have declined as the amount of capital decreased 
by year end  the value of the company s securities would have dwindled to approximately million  from a starting point of over million 
by year end  the estimated value of the securities would have fallen to approximately million 
by year end  the company would be facing bankruptcy in graph hypothetical change in company assets that would have occurred had persistent losses from investment in treasury bills a rate of interest forced the company to cover losses by liquidating sections of its portfolio message graph illustrates the same scenario as graph  but assuming a interest rate from treasury bills 
the loss is somewhat less in this scenario  but by year end  securities would have fallen to approximately million  and the estimated value of the securities by would have been approximately million 
by year end  the company would be facing bankruptcy in graph loans payable per year message graph illustrates the company s loans payable at december from to from to  the amount of loans payable decreased sharply  and then stayed in a narrow range from to  remaining below million and reaching a low of million at december  after  because of the company s expanded research and development  the amount of loans began to increase steadily until december   when they exceeded the amount 
by december   the amount of loans returned somewhat to levels but was still significant 
had the company invested in treasury bills  this would have led by year end to a combination of depleted capital  increased debt  and looming bankruptcy 
graph operating revenues and total expenses from to message graph illustrates operational revenues and total expenses from to operational revenues dropped sharply between and between and  operational revenues began to recover  but they have not yet reached pre levels 
expenses were fairly constant between and  but they have increased since because of the expansion in research  development  and marketing 
throughout the entire twelve years  operating expenses have consistently exceeded operating revenues 
graph marketable securities at cost compared to the rate of return message graph shows the cost of securities compared with rate of return investment income cost of securities from to the rate of return includes dividends and net profits from security sales  but it does not include unrealized profits 
had these been included  the rate of return would have been higher 
the actual rate of return is more than three times the rate of return that the company would have received if the company had invested exclusively in treasury bills 
the company  therefore  has benefited from the cash management policy of the past years 
graph us treasury portfolio  institutional service class shares  for  from reich tang asset management  llc message graph shows the interest rates for the past years of a representative treasury portfolio reported by reich tang asset management  llc  a well known fund specializing in government debt  such as t bills 
the average interest rate for the past years is  and the average interest rate for the last five years is 
above  graphs using hypothetical interest rates of and are used to predict how the company s finances could have been affected had the company invested in treasury bills 
below  graphs utilizing this representative data from reich tang provide additional validation of the accuracy of the above predictions 
graph comparison of net earnings with hypothetical earnings that would have resulted had the company invested in treasury bills with interest rates reported by reich tang over the ten year period message graph illustrates the same three sets of data as graphs and  utilizing interest rates from graph although rates were not available for  the results are similar to those from the previous two graphs  validating the accuracy of those hypothetical predictions 
had the company invested in these or similar treasury bills  the company would have faced persistent losses over this period of time 
graph hypothetical change in company assets that would have occurred had persistent losses from investment in treasury bills with interest rates reported by reich tang forced the company to cover losses by liquidating sections of its portfolio message graph illustrates the same scenario as graphs and  utilizing the interest rates from graph again  the results are very similar to those from graphs and  providing validation for the hypothetical predictions 
by year end  securities would have fallen to approximately million  and securities by year end to been approximately million 
had the company invested in these or similar treasury bills  by year end  the company would be facing bankruptcy in summary of actual portfolio investments the company s portfolio value is exposed to fluctuations in the general value of utilities 
an increase of interest rates could affect the company in two ways one would be to put downward pressure on the valuation of utility stocks as well as increase the company s cost of borrowing 
because of the size of the unrealized gains in the company s portfolio  the company does not anticipate any changes which could reduce the value of the company s utility portfolio below historical cost 
utilities operate in an environment of federal  state and local regulations  and they may disproportionately affect an individual utility 
the company s exposure to regulatory risk is mitigated due to it s diversity of holdings 
at december  and  the company held and separate stocks  respectively 
puts and calls are marked to market for each reporting period and any gain or loss is recognized through the statement of operations and labeled as mark to market of short positions
