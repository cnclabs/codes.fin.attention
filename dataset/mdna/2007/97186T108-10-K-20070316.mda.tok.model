item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion presents management s analysis of our results of operations and financial condition as of and for each of the years in the three year period ended december  all per share amounts and number of shares outstanding in this item have been retroactively adjusted and restated to give effect to the two for one stock splits effected in the form of a stock dividend in december the discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes related thereto which appear elsewhere in this report 
executive overview introduction wilshire bancorp  inc succeeded to the business and operations of wilshire state bank the bank upon consummation of the reorganization of the bank into a holding company structure  effective as of august  prior to the completion of the reorganization  the bank was subject to the information  reporting and proxy statement requirements of the exchange act  pursuant to the regulations of its primary regulator  the federal deposit insurance corporation  or fdic 
accordingly  the bank filed annual and quarterly reports  proxy statements and other information with the fdic 
pursuant to rule g of the exchange act  the company has succeeded to the reporting obligations of the bank and the reporting obligations of the bank to the fdic have terminated 
filings by the company under the exchange act  like this form k  are to be made with the sec 
note that while we refer generally to the company throughout this filing  all references to the company prior to august   except where otherwise indicated  are to the bank 
we operate community banks in the general commercial banking business  with our primary market encompassing the multi ethnic population of the los angeles metropolitan area 
our full service offices are located primarily in areas where a majority of the businesses are owned by korean speaking immigrants  with many of the remaining businesses owned by hispanic and other minority groups 
at december   we had approximately billion in assets  billion in total loans  and billion in deposits 
we also have expanded and diversified our business by focusing on the continued development of our commercial and consumer lending divisions 
as of may   we completed the acquisition of liberty bank of new york liberty and its merger into wilshire state bank 
with this acquisition  we added million in total assets and two branches in new york city 
we paid million for this transaction  which consisted of million in cash and million in our common stock  shares 
we also incurred merger related costs of  which we recognized as additional consideration in connection with this business combination 
since the acquisition  our loan portfolio in new york has grown by  from million to million at the end of deposit growth has exceeded our expectations as well  from million at the time of the acquisition to million at the end of over the past several years  our network of branches and loan production offices has been expanded geographically 
we currently maintain eighteen branch offices and seven loan production offices 
our expansion in these areas complements our multi ethnic small business focus 
we intend to continue our growth strategy in future years through the opening of additional branches and loan production offices as our needs and resources permit 
in december  the bank issued million of the junior subordinated debentures 
subsequently  the company  as a wholly owned subsidiary in and as a parent company of the bank in  issued a total of  of junior subordinated debentures in connection with a  trust preferred securities issuance by statutory trusts wholly owned by the company 
we believe that the supplemental capital raised in connection with the issuance of these debentures allowed us to achieve and maintain status as a well capitalized institution and sustained our continued loan growth 
as evidenced by our past several years of operations  we have experienced significant balance sheet growth 
we have implemented a strategy of building our core banking foundation by focusing on commercial loans and business transaction accounts 
our management believes that this strategy has created recurring revenue streams  diversified our product portfolio and enhanced shareholder value 
key performance indicators we believe the following were key indicators of our performance for operations during our total assets grew to billion at the end of  or an increase of from billion at the end of our total deposits grew to billion at the end of  or an increase of from billion at the end of our total loans grew to billion at the end of  or an increase of from billion at the end of total noninterest income increased to million in  or an increase of from million in due mainly to the gain on sale of the nonguaranteed portion of sba loans 
our efficiency ratio the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income before provision for loan losses and total noninterest income remained at a relatively low level at and in and  respectively 
total noninterest expense increased from million in to million in  reflecting the expanded personnel and premises associated with our business growth 
noninterest expenses as a percentage of average assets were lowered to in from in these items  as well as other factors  contributed to the increase in net income for to million  or per diluted common share as compared with million  or per diluted common share in and are discussed in further detail throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
outlook as we look ahead to  the economies and real estate markets in our primary market areas will continue to be significant determinants of the quality of our assets in future periods and thus our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
we anticipate that the national economy is headed for a soft landing in and that this will generally affect asset quality negatively 
responding proactively to this anticipated business environment  we are shifting our focus from growth to asset quality improvement 
we have already enhanced our loan underwriting standards more stringently and made it more difficult to allow exceptions from our loan policy 
we anticipate these changes will result in moderating loan growth  but at the same time improving loan quality 
our focus on net interest margin management will continue 
we have generally been in an asset sensitive position  meaning that our interest earning assets will re price more quickly than our interest bearing liabilities 
although the interest repricing gap in our models indicate that our margin generally decreases in a declining interest rate environment  we do not anticipate a major drop  if any  in our net interest margin because our rate sensitivity position between assets and liabilities for the one year timeframe is currently about neutral 
it is also our expectation that the strategic change toward more moderate loan growth will make our funding needs subside and our reliance on high cost deposits to decline 
as a result  our net interest margin should improve 
we also believe that these strategic changes and our expansion into the east coast market of the united states  together with our core deposit campaign that linked monetary awards to core deposit growth  will also benefit our net interest margin going forward 
notwithstanding the overall slower national economy  we believe that there will be continued growth in our primary market areas  which includes the korean american business sectors located in southern california  texas  and the greater new york metropolitan area  due mainly to the anticipated capital influx from the republic of korea 
we therefore believe that we will continue to grow  just at a more controlled pace than we have experienced in the past few years 
such reduction of the growth rate is expected to result in a healthier balance sheet with better asset quality and more core deposits 
we will continue to pursue opportunities for growth in our existing markets  as well as opportunities to expand into new markets through de novo branching and regional loan production offices 
we are currently in the process of acquiring a branch in new jersey and we also expect to open another branch in the greater new york metropolitan area 
we are targeting both branches to open in the first half of and we believe these two new branches  together with the existing new york branches  will be a critical part of our expansion strategy  especially in the east coast market of the united states due to its high level of small business activity and diverse population 
in addition  we will continue to focus on streamlining our operations so that our expenses grow more slowly than the overall growth of our business 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
in particular  we have identified several accounting policies that  due to judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
these policies relate to the classification and valuation of investment securities  the methodologies that determine our allowance for loan losses  the treatment of non accrual loans  the valuation of properties acquired through foreclosure  the valuation of retained interests and mortgage servicing assets related to the sales of small business administration loans  and the treatment and valuation of stock based compensation and business combination 
in each area  we have identified the variables most important in the estimation process 
we have used the best information available to make the estimation necessary to value the related assets and liabilities 
actual performance that differs from our estimates and future changes in the key variables could change future valuation and impact net income 
allowance for loan losses accounting for allowance for loan losses involves significant judgment and assumptions by management and is based on historical data and management s view of the current economic environment 
at least on a quarterly basis  our management reviews the methodology and adequacy of allowance for loan losses and reports its assessment to the board of directors for its review and approval 
we base our allowance for loan losses on an estimation of probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
our methodology for assessing loan loss allowances is intended to reduce the differences between estimated and actual losses and involves a detailed analysis of our loan portfolio in three phases the specific review of individual loans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  the segmenting and reviewing of loan pools with similar characteristics in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and our judgmental estimate based on various qualitative factors 
the first phase of our allowance analysis involves the specific review of individual loans to identify and measure impairment 
at this phase  we evaluate each loan except for homogeneous loans  such as automobile loans and home mortgages 
specific risk rated loans are deemed impaired with respect to all amounts  including principal and interest  which will likely not be collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the related loan agreement 
impairment for commercial and real estate loans is measured either based on the present value of the loan s expected future cash flows or  if collection on the loan is collateral dependent  the estimated fair value of the collateral  less selling and holding costs 
the second phase involves segmenting the remainder of the risk rated loan portfolio into groups or pools of loans  together with loans with similar characteristics for evaluation in accordance with sfas no 
we perform loss migration analysis and calculate the loss migration ratio for each loan pool based on its historical net losses and benchmark it against the levels of other peer banks 
in the third phase  we consider relevant internal and external factors that may affect the collectibility of a loan portfolio and each group of loan pools 
as a general rule  the factors detailed below will be considered to have no impact to our loss migration analysis 
however  if there exists information to warrant adjustment to the loss migration ratios  the changes will be made in accordance with the established parameters and supported by narrative and or statistical analysis 
we use a credit risk matrix to determine the impact to the loss migration analysis 
this matrix enables management to adjust the general allocation based on the loss migration ratio up to additional for each loan pool 
the factors currently considered include  but are not limited to  those described below 
for all factors  the extent of the adjustment will be commensurate with the severity of the conditions that concern each factor 
concentration of credits this factor may be adjusted based on the identification of any concentration or significant changes to the level of identified concentrations of credit 
a concentration of credit is defined as loans to any single borrower  affiliated group of borrowers  or borrowers engaged in or dependent upon one industry that exceeds of tier capital reserves 
a concentration can also result from an acquisition of a volume of loans from a single source  regardless of the diversity of the individual borrowers 
delinquency trends the trend of delinquency shall be assessed by the quarterly trend and the comparison with peer average 
nature and volume of loan trend this factor will be adjusted for significant changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio 
non accrual loan trend the trend of non accrual loans shall be assessed by the quarterly trend and the comparison with peer average 
problem loan trend this factor may be adjusted depending on the quarterly trend of criticized and classified loans in the total loans 
loss and recovery trend this factor may be adjusted depending on the quarterly trend of the net charge offs and the comparison with peers 
quality of loan review this factor may be adjusted when there has been a noted and significant as determined and documented from external or internal sources deterioration or improvement in the loan review system and or director s oversight 
an adjustment will generally occur when there had previously been a documented weakness and clear improvement was noted by external sources  or when a significant deterioration was noted by external sources  in the loan review system and or the degree of oversight by the directors 
in the absence of noted changes to the loan review system and or the degree of oversight by the directors  no adjustment will be made 
lending and management staff this factor will be adjusted with changes to the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff that are significant enough to warrant adjustment to the loss migration ratio 
if the staffing or the experience level of lending staff is considered to be adequate as determined by an external source then  in general  no adjustment will be made 
lending policies and procedures this factor may be adjusted depending on the documented results of external reviews of the policies and procedures  including underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices 
the trend of policy or procedure exceptions will also have an impact on this factor 
it is the objective of the board of directors and management to maintain at all times adequate policies  procedures  underwriting standards  and practices 
economic and business conditions this factor may be adjusted depending on local  regional  and national economic trends and their perceived impact on particular market segments 
in the periods of stable economic environment  no adjustment will be made 
external factors such as changes in legal and regulatory requirements  on the level of estimated credit losses in the current portfolio this factor may be adjusted depending on the trend of external factors and their perceived impact on the overall credit risk 
in the periods of stable regulatory environment  no adjustment will be made 
other adjustments with a supporting rationale  this factor may be used for adjustments which cannot be addressed by the foregoing factors 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these factors is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio components 
management currently intends to manage an unallocated allowance not to exceed of the total estimated allowance for loan losses  due to the inherent risk associated with the imprecision in estimating the allowance 
central to our credit risk management and our assessment of appropriate loss allowance is our loan risk rating system 
under this system  the originating credit officer assigns borrowers an initial risk rating based on a thorough analysis of each borrower s financial capacity in conjunction with industry and economic trends 
approvals are made based upon the amount of inherent credit risk specific to the transaction and are reviewed for appropriateness by senior line and credit administration personnel 
credits are monitored by line and credit administration personnel for deterioration in a borrower s financial condition which may impact the ability of the borrower to perform under the contract 
although management has allocated a portion of the allowance to specific loans  specific loan pools  including off balance sheet credit exposures which are reported separately as part of other liabilities  the adequacy of the allowance is considered in its entirety 
sba loans certain small business administration sba loans that may be sold prior to maturity have been designated as held for sale at origination and are recorded at the lower of cost or market value  determined on an aggregate basis 
a valuation allowance is established if the market value of such loans is lower than their cost  and operations are charged or credited for valuation adjustments 
when we sell a loan  we usually sell the guaranteed portion of the loan and retain the non guaranteed portion 
we receive sales proceeds from i the guaranteed principal of the loan  ii the deferred premium for the difference between the book value of the retained portion and the fair value allocated to the retained portion  and iii the loan excess servicing fee esf 
at the time of sale  the deferred premium  which is amortized over the remaining life of the loan as an adjustment to yield  is recorded for the difference between the book value and the fair value allocated to the retained portion 
the sales gain is recognized from the difference between the proceeds and the book value allocated to the sold portion 
we allocate the book value of the related loan among three portions on the basis of their relative fair value i the sold portion  ii the retained portion  and iii the esf 
we estimate the fair value of each portion based on the following 
the amount received for the sale represents the fair value of the sold portion 
the fair value of the retained portion is computed by discounting  at above the contract rate note rate  its future cash flows over the estimated life of the loan 
we calculate the fair value of the esf for the loan from the cash in flow of the net servicing fee over the estimated life of the loan  discounted at above the main note rate of the related loan 
we capitalize the fair value allocated to esf in two categories i intangible servicing assets the contracted servicing fee less normal servicing costs typically basis points  and ii interest only strip receivables excess of esf over the contracted servicing fee 
the servicing asset is recorded based on the present value of the contractually specified servicing fee  net of servicing cost  over the estimated life of the loan  using a discount rate of above the main note rate of the related loan 
the servicing asset is amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated servicing income 
management periodically evaluates the fair value of servicing assets for impairment 
a valuation allowance is recorded when the fair value is below the carrying amount and a recovery of the valuation allowance is recorded when its fair value exceeds the carrying amount 
however  a reversal may not exceed the original valuation allowance recorded 
for purposes of measuring impairment  the servicing assets are stratified by collateral type 
an interest only strip is recorded based on the present value of the excess of future interest income  over the contractually specified servicing fee  calculated using the same assumptions as noted above 
interest only strips are accounted for at their estimated fair value  with unrealized gains recorded as an adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
if the estimated fair value is less than its carrying value  the loss is considered as other than temporary impairment and it is charged to the current earnings 
non accrual loan policy interest on loans is credited to income as earned and is accrued only if deemed collectible 
accrual of interest is discontinued when a loan is over days delinquent unless management believes the loan is adequately collateralized and in the process of collection 
generally  payments received on nonaccrual loans are recorded as principal reductions 
interest income is recognized after all principal has been repaid or an improvement in the condition of the loan has occurred that would warrant resumption of interest accruals 
affordable housing investments the company has invested in limited partnerships formed to develop and operate affordable housing units for lower income tenants throughout the states of california  texas  and new york 
the costs of the investments are being amortized on a straight line method over the life of related tax credits 
if the partnerships cease to qualify during the compliance period  the credits may be denied for any period in which the projects are not in compliance and a portion of the credits previously taken is subject to recapture with interest 
such investments are recorded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition 
stock based compensation the company issued stock based compensation to certain employees  officers  and directors 
prior to december   the company accounted for its fixed stock options using the intrinsic value method  presented in apb opinion no  accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related interpretations  which generally does not result in compensation expense recognition 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation cost for stock options is measured at the date of grant as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our stock over the exercise price of the options 
on january   the company adopted sfas r  share based payment  for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r allows for two alternative transition methods 
the company follows the modified prospective method  which requires application of the new statement to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after the required effective date 
accordingly  prior period amounts have not been restated 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of january  will be recognized as the requisite services are rendered on or after january  the compensation cost of that portion of awards is based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo  which represents real estate acquired through foreclosure  or deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of commercial and real estate loans  is carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less the estimated selling costs of the real estate 
the fair value of the property is based upon a current appraisal 
the difference between the fair value of the real estate collateral and the loan balance at the time of transfer is recorded as a loan charge off if fair value is lower 
subsequent to foreclosure  management periodically performs valuations and the oreo property is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value  less cost to sell 
the determination of a property s estimated fair value incorporates i revenues projected to be realized from disposal of the property  ii construction and renovation costs  iii marketing and transaction costs  and iv holding costs eg  property taxes  insurance and homeowners association dues 
any subsequent declines in the fair value of the oreo property after the date of transfer are recorded through a write down of the asset 
any subsequent operating expenses or income  reduction in estimated fair values  and gains or losses on disposition of such properties are charged or credited to current operations 
investment securities our investment policy seeks to provide and maintain liquidity  and to produce favorable returns on investments without incurring unnecessary interest rate or credit risk  while complementing our lending activities 
our investment securities portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates may cause actual prepayments to vary from the estimated prepayments over the life of a security 
this may result in adjustments to the amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts related to these instruments  consequently changing the net yield on such securities 
reinvestment risk is also associated with the cash flows from such securities 
the unrealized gain loss on such securities may also be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates 
under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  investment securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and recorded at amortized cost 
securities not classified as held to maturity or trading  with readily determinable fair values  are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value 
purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the estimated lives of the securities 
currently  all of our investment securities are classified as either available for sale or held to maturity 
the unrealized gains and losses for available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income  as part of shareholders equity 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf  we are obligated to assess  at each reporting date  whether there is other than temporary impairment to our investment securities 
declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
gains and losses on the sale of securities are recorded on the trade date 
as of december  and december   no investment securities were determined to have any other than temporary impairment 
business combination during the second quarter of  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 
 the purchase of liberty bank of new york liberty required significant estimates and assumptions 
we engaged outside experts  including appraisers  to assist in estimating the fair values of certain assets acquired  particularly the loan portfolio  core deposit intangible asset and fixed assets 
the bank used market data regarding securities market prices and interest rates to estimate the fair values of financial assets  including the securities portfolio  deposits and borrowings 
we also evaluated long lived assets for impairment and no significant impairment was noted 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination  we recognized liabilities assumed for costs to involuntarily terminate employees of liberty and we do not assume any costs to exit activities of liberty 
in connection with the acquisition of the liberty  the company also recognized goodwill and intangible assets 
see further discussion on this matter in note 
of the company s financial statements included herein 
pursuant to sfas no 
 the company tested goodwill and intangible assets for impairment as of december  there was no impairment in recorded goodwill and intangible assets as of december  results of operations net interest income and net interest margin our primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest and fees derived from earning assets and interest paid on liabilities obtained to fund those assets 
our net interest income is affected by changes in the level and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as volume changes 
our net interest income is also affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities  referred to as rate changes 
interest rates charged on our loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans  the supply of money available for lending purposes and competitive factors 
those factors are  in turn  affected by general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control  such as federal economic policies  the general supply of money in the economy  legislative tax policies  the governmental budgetary matters  and the actions of the federal reserve board frb 
average net loans were billion in  as compared with billion in and million in  representing increases of and in and  respectively  from each of the prior annual periods and average interest earning assets were billion in  as compared with billion in and billion in  representing increases of and in and  respectively  from each of the prior annual periods

such charges were not made only for our outstanding loan portfolio  but also for off balance sheet items  such as commitments to extend credits or letters of credit 
the charges made for our outstanding loan portfolio were credited to allowance for loan losses  whereas charges for off balance sheet items were credited to the reserve for off balance sheet items  which are presented as a component of other liabilities 
our stringent loan underwriting standard and proactive credit follow up procedures have helped us successfully curb an increase of the provision for loan losses despite our rapid loan growth 
however  the provision for loan losses increased to million in from million and million in and  respectively  to keep pace with the continued growth of our loan portfolio and an increase of non performing loans see nonperforming assets below for further discussion 
the said provision for loan losses included the amount we provided for the credit risk of off balance sheet items   and  in  and  respectively 
the procedures for monitoring the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  as well as detailed information concerning the allowance itself  are described in the section entitled allowance for loan losses below 
noninterest income total noninterest income increased to million in as compared with million in and million in noninterest income was of average assets in and  lowered from in we currently earn non interest income from various sources  including an income stream provided by bank owned life insurance  or boli  in the form of an increase in cash surrender value 
net loan fees have been included in the calculation of interest income 
net loan fees were approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
loans are net of the allowance for loan losses  deferred fees  unearned income  and related direct costs  but include those placed on non accrual status 
the following table sets forth the various components of our noninterest income for the periods indicated noninterest income dollars in thousands for the years ended december  amount amount amount service charges on deposit accounts gain on sale of loans loan related servicing income loan referral fee income sba loan packaging fee income from other earning assets other income total average assets noninterest income as a of average assets our largest source of noninterest income in was the gain on sale of loans  usually representing over of total noninterest income 
it increased to million in from million and million in and  respectively 
this noninterest income is derived primarily from the sale of the guaranteed portion of sba loans 
we sell the guaranteed portion of sba loans in government securities secondary markets and retain servicing rights 
sba loan production levels increased to million in as compared with million and million in  and  respectively  and accordingly the sales gains on the guaranteed portions of sba loans increased to million in as compared with million in and million in we also sell the unguaranteed portion of sba loans  but the resulting gains are not considered a stable source of income since the unguaranteed portion is sold primarily for credit risk management purposes 
the gain on sale of the unguaranteed portions of sba loans was million   and million in   and  respectively 
this source of noninterest income also includes sales gains on residential mortgage loans 
since the inception of our home loan center in the fourth quarter of  the sale of residential mortgage loans have become a stable noninterest income source  but gain on such sales decreased to  in  as compared with  and  in and  respectively  due to the slowdown of the residential mortgage market 
our second largest source of noninterest income was service charge income on deposit accounts  usually representing approximately of total noninterest income 
this revenue source generally increases in accordance with an increase in the number of transactional accounts and increased by in to million from million in in  the more rigid monitoring procedures we imposed on the money service business  or msb  accounts reduced the volume of transactions and service fee income from those msb accounts and limited the increase in this revenue source  relative to the increase of transactional accounts  by only from million in we constantly review service charge rates to maximize service charge income while maintaining a competitive position 
the third largest source of noninterest income was loan related servicing income 
this fee income consists of trade financing fees and servicing fees on sba loans sold 
significant reversals of servicing assets on sold loans  which were paid off before their maturities  decreased this income source to million and million in and  respectively  from million in the servicing fees on sold sba loans are credited when we collect the monthly payments on the sold loans we are servicing  and charged by the monthly amortization of servicing assets that we previously capitalized as intangible servicing assets and interest only strip receivables upon sale of the related loans 
such servicing assets are also reversed and charged against the fee income account when the sold loans are paid off before the related servicing assets are fully amortized 
in and  million and million  respectively  of servicing assets were charged back to this income account by early pay offs as compared with  in in light of our increasing emphasis on trade financing activities and the continuing growth of our servicing loan portfolio million  million  and million at year end   and  respectively  management believes that this income source should continue to improve as prepayments on sba loans slow down 
however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
our loan referral fee income source includes income derived from our referring to other financial institutions loans that did not meet our lending requirements for various reasons  including size  availability of funds  credit criteria and others 
our referral fee income in decreased to  as compared with  in which previously increased from  in we cannot assure you that this source of revenue will increase because loan referrals do not represent our core banking business and fee income therefrom is not a stable source of revenue 
sba loan packaging fee income  which represents charges to borrowers for sba loan processing  increased to  in as compared with  in and  in as the volume of sba loan production increased 
income on other earning assets represents income from earning assets other than interest earning assets  such as dividend income from fhlb stock ownership and the increase in cash surrender value of boli 
such income was million   and  in  and  respectively 
these increases were primarily attributable to an additional purchase of million in boli in the second quarter of and the increased acquisition of fhlb stock as required by the new capital plan of the federal home loan bank of san francisco that went into effect on april  other income represented income from miscellaneous sources  such as gain on sale of investment securities and the excess of insurance proceeds over the carrying value of an insured loss and generally increases as our business grows 
other income increased to million in from million in  which previously decreased from million in when we had some nonrecurring additional revenues such as a settlement award on an insurance claim and gain on sale call of investment securities 
noninterest expense total noninterest expense increased to million in from million in which previously increased from million in these increases can be attributed to the expanded personnel and premises associated with our business growth  including the recent openings of new offices 
however  due to continuing efforts to minimize operating expenses  noninterest expenses as a percentage of average assets were lowered to in from in and in management believes that its efforts in cost cutting and revenue diversification have improved our operational efficiency  as evidenced by our relatively low efficiency ratio the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income before provision for loan losses and total noninterest income 
our efficiency ratio was stable at and  in and  respectively  and improved from in the following table sets forth a summary of noninterest expenses for the periods indicated noninterest expense dollars in thousands for the years ended december  amount amount amount salaries and employee benefits occupancy and equipment data processing loan referral fee professional fees directors fees office supplies investor relation expenses advertising and promotional communications deposit insurance premium outsourced service for customers amortization of intangibles other total average assets noninterest expense as a of average assets salaries and employee benefits historically represent more than half of total noninterest expense and generally increase as our branch network and business volume expand 
the new branch and loan production office openings increased these expenses to million in as compared with million in and million in  representing increases of and in and  respectively  over each of the prior year periods 
despite our efforts to promote efficient operations by limiting personnel growth  the number of full time equivalent employees increased to in december  as compared with and in and  respectively 
the significant increase in was mainly caused by our acquisition of two branches in new york 
however  our significant asset growth helped us continue to increase assets per employee to million at the end of from million and million at the end of and  respectively 
occupancy and equipment expenses represent approximately to of total noninterest expenses and totaled million in  compared to million in and million in  representing increases of and in and  respectively  over each of the prior year periods 
these increases were attributable primarily to the expansion of our office network and the additional office space for new departments 
the increase in was more significant due to the lease expenses for the two new york branches acquired in may data processing expenses increased to million in from million in  which previously increased from million in office supply expenses also increased to  in from  and  in and  respectively  representing an increase of and in and  respectively  over each of the prior year periods 
these increases in data processing and office supplies expenses correspond to the growth of our business 
loan referral fees are paid to brokers who refer loans to us  mostly sba loans 
although we also pay referral fees for some qualified commercial loans  referral fee expenses generally correspond to our sba loan production level 
sba loan production increased to million in  from million in and million in and these referral fees accordingly increased to million in  as compared with million and million in and  respectively 
professional fees generally increase as we grow and we expect these expenditures will continue to be significant  as we address the enhanced sec and nasdaq corporate governance requirements and the local regulation of the states into which we expand our business operations 
professional fees were   and  or   and of total noninterest expense  in  and  respectively 
the professional fees unusually high due mainly to the legal and accounting fees incurred to comply with the enhanced financial reporting requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  or sox  and fees in connection with the holding company reorganization 
advertising and promotional expenses increased to million in from  in which previously increased from  in  representing   and of total noninterest expenses in  and  respectively 
such increases were attributable to expanded marketing activities  such as media advertisements and promotional gifts for customers of newly opened offices  especially in the new areas such as texas and new york 
outsourced service costs for customers are payments made to third parties who provide services that were traditionally provided by banks to their customers  such as armored car services or bookkeeping services  and are recouped from the earnings credits earned by the respective depositors on their balances maintained with us 
due to the reduction of such services  these expenses have decreased slightly to million in from million in in  these expenses increased from million in due to the increase in depositors demanding such services  such as escrow accounts and brokerage accounts 
investor relations expenses represent costs for providing services to our existing or prospective shareholders  such as nasdaq listing fees  fees for an outside investor relations company and various promotional material costs 
these expenses decreased to  as compared with  in when the nasdaq listing fees were paid for additional shares issued in connection with the december stock split and  in when additional expenses incurred in connection with the holding company reorganization 
noninterest expense  other than the categories specifically addressed above  increased by  or  to million in from million in in  noninterest expenses increased by  or  from million in such increases represent the normal growth in association with the growth of our business activities and appear in line with our expectation 
generally  noninterest expense has increased from to as a result of rapid asset growth and in and  respectively  and the expansion of our office network and products 
management anticipates that noninterest expense will continue to increase as we continue to grow 
however  management remains committed to cost control and operational efficiency  and we expect to keep these increases to a minimum relative to our rate of growth 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december   we made a provision for income taxes of million on pretax net income of million  representing an effective tax rate of  as compared with a provision for income taxes of million on pretax net income of million  representing an effective tax rate of for  and a provision of million on pretax net income of million  representing an effective tax rate of for the effective tax rates in were slightly lower than those in prior years due mainly to the effect of a change in the estimated tax provision 
we filed our income tax returns in the third quarter of and the actual income tax liability on the return was approximately  less than the provision we estimated in  resulting in a reversal of tax payable in our effective tax rates are usually one to two percentage points lower than statutory rates due to state tax benefits derived from doing business in an enterprise zone and the tax preferential treatment for the bank owned life insurance and low income housing tax credit funds see other earning assets for further discussion 
generally  income tax expense is the sum of two components current tax expense and deferred tax expense benefit 
current tax expense is calculated by applying the current tax rate to taxable income 
deferred tax expense accounts for the change in deferred tax assets liabilities from year to year 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the tax effects  based on current tax law  of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized in the financial statements 
because we traditionally recognize substantially more expenses in our financial statements than we have been allowed to deduct for taxes  we generally have a net deferred tax asset 
at december   and  we had net deferred tax assets of million  million and million  respectively 
we believe that we have adequately provided or paid for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
based upon consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances  we do not believe the ultimate resolution of tax issues for all open tax periods will have a materially adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition 
financial condition loan portfolio total loans are the sum of loans receivable and loans held for sale and reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income which is unamortized deferred fees and costs and premiums and discounts 
total loans net of unearned income increased by million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  total loans net of unearned income were billion  million and million at december   and  respectively 
total loans net of unearned income as a percentage of total assets were     and for    and  respectively 
real estate secured loans consist primarily of commercial real estate loans and are extended to finance the purchase and or improvement of commercial real estate and or businesses thereon 
the properties may be either user owned or for investment purposes 
our loan policy adheres to the real estate loan guidelines set forth by the fdic 
the policy provides guidelines including  among other things  fair review of appraisal value  limitation on loan to value ratio  and minimum cash flow requirements to service debt 
loans secured by real estate equaled billion  billion  million  million  and million  as of december     and  respectively 
real estate secured loans as a percentage of total loans were     and at december     and  respectively 
due to the slowdown of the california real estate market and our target marketing efforts for unsecured business and commercial loans  the composition of real estate secured loans have decreased in and we believe there will be further decreases going forward 
we offer a wide selection of residential mortgage programs  including non traditional mortgages such as interest only and payment option adjustable rate mortgages 
most of our salable loans are transferred to the secondary market while we retain a portion on our books as portfolio loans 
our total home mortgage loan portfolio outstanding at the end of and was million and million  respectively and we have deemed its effect on our credit risk profile to be immaterial 
the residential mortgage loans with unconventional terms such as interest only mortgage and option adjustable rate mortgage at december  were million and million  respectively  inclusive of loans held temporarily for sale or refinancing 
they were million and million  respectively  at december  commercial and industrial loans include revolving lines of credit  as well as term business loans 
commercial and industrial loans were million  million  million  million  and million at the end of    and  respectively 
commercial and industrial loans were     and as a percentage of total loans at the end of    and  respectively 
such increases in recent years were mainly caused by our marketing strategy targeted for the relationship based accounts  such as unsecured business and commercial loans 
consumer loans have historically represented less than of our total loan portfolio 
the majority of consumer loans are concentrated in automobile loans  which we provide as a service only to existing customers 
with our target marketing for them  the consumer loans continued to increase to million  million  million  million  and million  at december     and  respectively 
consumer loans as a percentage of total loans are however still minimal 
management anticipates further increases in consumer loans going forward  although no assurance can be given that this increase will occur 
construction loans are generally extended as a temporary financing vehicle only 
in the third quarter of  we formed a construction loan department by appointing a construction loan specialist as its manager 
since then  construction loans increased to million and million  respectively at the end of and  as compared with million  million  and million  respectively  at the end of   and construction loans as a percentage of total loans also increased to at the end of from to in prior years 
we expect to expand our construction lending activities with this specialized capacity under the guidance of the commercial loan center 
our loan terms vary according to loan type 
commercial term loans have typical maturities of three to five years and are extended to finance the purchase of business entities  business equipment  and leasehold improvements  or to provide permanent working capital 
sba guaranteed loans usually have longer maturities to years 
we generally limit real estate loan maturities to five to eight years 
lines of credit  in general  are extended on an annual basis to businesses that need temporary working capital and or import export financing 
we generally seek diversification in our loan portfolio  and our borrowers are diverse as to industry  location  and their current and target markets 
the following table sets forth the amount of total loans net of unearned income and the percentage distributions in each category  as of the dates indicated distribution of loans and percentage composition of loan portfolio amount outstanding as of december  dollars in thousands construction real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer total loans net of unearned income participation loans sold and serviced by the company construction real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer total loans net of unearned income the following table shows the contractual maturity distribution and repricing intervals of the outstanding loans in our portfolio as of december  in addition  the table shows the distribution of such loans between those with variable or floating interest rates and those with fixed or predetermined interest rates 
the amounts on the table below are the gross loan balances at december  before netting unearned income totaling million and the gross amount of non accrual loans of million is not included loan maturities and repricing schedule at december   within one year after one but within five years after five years total dollars in thousands construction real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer total loans loans with variable floating interest rates loans with predetermined fixed interest rates the majority of the properties taken as collateral are located in southern california 
the loans generated by our loan production offices  which are located outside of our main geographical market  are generally collateralized by property in close proximity to those offices 
we employ strict guidelines regarding the use of collateral located in less familiar market areas 
since a major real estate recession during the first part of the previous decade  property values in southern california have generally increased 
however in  we have started to see below trend growth in gdp and a slowdown of the real estate market in california 
given the current economic conditions  no assurance can be given that property values will not significantly decrease 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets consist of loans on non accrual status  loans days or more past due and still accruing interest  loans restructured  where the terms of repayment have been renegotiated resulting in a reduction or deferral of interest or principal  and other nonperforming assets 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when they become days past due  unless management believes the loan is adequately collateralized and in the process of collection 
the past due loans may or may not be adequately collateralized  but collection efforts are continuously pursued 
loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some changes in financial status  causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms  and where we believe the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and repay the loan in full 
other nonperforming assets  mainly other real estate owned oreo and repossessed vehicles  consist of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means that management intends to offer for sale 
despite the significant growth of our loan portfolio  our continued emphasis on asset quality control enabled us to maintain a relatively low level of nonperforming loans prior to however  the general economic condition of the united states as well as the local economies in which we do business has shown a slowdown as the housing sector has cooled in and the transition to below trend gdp growth has started 
this transition of the economy affected our borrowers strength and our nonperforming loans increased to million at the end of  as compared with million  million  million  and million at the end of    and  respectively 
at december   the nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans therefore increased from and at december  and  respectively  but still relatively low at and lower than and  respectively  at the end of and when some of our borrowers were negatively affected by the then economic conditions 
at december   we had  as other nonperforming assets  the majority of which were represented by one oreo  foreclosed in and subsequently sold at a small loss in january at the end of  we had three oreo as other nonperforming assets in an amount of  which were subsequently sold without significant losses 
at the end of  our only nonperforming asset was a single family residence in an amount of  which was subsequently sold without a significant loss 
we had no other nonperforming assets at the end of and together with oreo and repossessed vehicles  we managed the ratio of nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and other nonperforming assets at a relatively low level for the past five years  equaling     and as of december     and  respectively 
management believes that the reserve provided for nonperforming loans  together with the tangible collateral  were adequate as of december  see allowance for loan losses below for further discussion 
except as disclosed above  as of december   management was not aware of any material credit problems of borrowers that would cause it to have serious doubts about the ability of a borrower to comply with the present loan payment terms 
however  no assurance can be given that credit problems may exist that may not have been brought to the attention of management 
the following table provides information with respect to the components of our nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated the figures in the table are net of the portion guaranteed by the us government nonperforming assets at december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer total loans days or more past due and still accruing as to principal or interest construction real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer total restructured loans  real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer total total nonperforming loans repossessed vehicles other real estate owned total nonperforming assets nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and other nonperforming assets allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans allowance for loan losses in anticipation of credit risk inherent in our lending business  we set aside allowances through charges to earnings 
such charges were not only made for the outstanding loan portfolio  but also for off balance sheet items  such as commitments to extend credit or letters of credit 
the charges made for the outstanding loan portfolio were credited to the allowance for loan losses  whereas charges for off balance sheet items were credited to the reserve for off balance sheet items  which is presented as a component of other liabilities 
the provision for loan losses is discussed in the section entitled provision for loan losses above 
during the th quarter of  we enhanced our methodology for estimating allowance for loan losses 
we started the credit loss migration analysis in on a cumulative basis  with years historical loss data tracing back to since then  the loss horizon has been unchanged with the same starting point of  due to negligible loss experience in the past years and the fact that the migration analysis requires several years for it to be set into a fully operating mode 
after a passage of years  which is deemed to be an appropriate time span for the migration analysis framework to be stabilized and for all the issues on the settings thereof to be identified  our methodology had been until recently under consideration for refinement in the near future 
in such courses of events  a new interagency policy statement on alll was publicized on december   which further prompted the foregoing cause 
during the fiscal year ended december   no interest income related to these loans was included in net income 
additional interest income of approximately  would have been recorded during the year ended december   if these loans had been paid in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the fiscal year ended december  or  if not outstanding throughout the fiscal year ended december   since origination 
a restructured loan is one the terms of which were renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
during the fiscal year ended december   approximately of interest income related to this loan was included in net income 
additional interest income would be negligible during the year ended december   if this loan had been paid in accordance with its original term and had been outstanding throughout the fiscal year ended december  two major changes have been made 
the first change was the change of the loss horizon look back period for the historic loss ratio calculation from cumulative basis to years moving average  which is more in line with the average lives of our loans 
also  the weights given to each period were adjusted 
prior to the change  the same weights have been assigned to all analysis periods  which may have allowed the aged loan losses to have undue influence on the reserve factors 
therefore  a change was made so that the highest weight of is given to the most recent year  which is to be reduced by each year going back 
the foregoing change is also in line with the new interagency policy statement on alll stating that during periods of economic stability in an institution s market  a relatively long period of time may be appropriate 
however  during periods of significant economic expansion or contraction  the relevance of data that are several years old may be limited 
the second change was made on the scale and the format of the qualitative adjustment 
the company s maximum scale prior to change was from to for each of factors 
in order to make it more in line with the industry average  the scale has been revised so that the maximum adjustment shall not exceed of general allocation 
the format of the qualitative adjustment was also revised so that factors with multiple subfactors are more objectively assessed 
as a result of these changes  we reduced the allowance for loan losses by million as of december  the first change reduced the second phase allocation review of pools of loans with similar characteristics in the phase of methodology table below by million and the second change increased the third phase allocation judgmental estimate based on qualitative factors in the phase of methodology table below by  with the economic transition addressed in nonperforming assets above  the net charge offs in increased to million as compared with   and  respectively in  and the net charge offs in included million consumer loan charge offs  the majority of which were the charge offs of authomobile loans  including automobile inventory financing  extended in connection with two used car dealers who closed down their businesses in the mid this million net charge offs represents of average total loans in  higher than   and  respectively  in   and it was however lower than million net charge offs or of average total loans in when the weak business climate adversely impacted the financial condition of a certain number of our clients 
in order to keep pace with the increase of nonperforming loans and our loan portfolio  we increased our allowance for loan losses by  or million  to million at december   as compared with million at december  such allowances were million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
with the continued increase of the allowance for loan losses in recent years  we were able to maintain the adequate ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans at     and at the end of    and  respectively 
management believes that the current ratio of is in line with our peer group average and adequate for our loan portfolio because the level of total non performing loans as of december  was relatively low at of total loans 
although management believes the allowance at december  was adequate to absorb losses from any known and inherent risks in the portfolio  no assurance can be given that economic conditions which adversely affect our service areas or other variables will not result in increased losses in the loan portfolio in the future 
with the foregoing new changes in effect  as of december  and  our allowance for loan losses consisted of amounts allocated from three phases of our methodology for assessing loan loss allowances  as follows see details of methodology for assessing allowance for loan losses in the section entitled critical accounting policies phase of methodology as of december  specific review of individual loans review of pools of loans with similar characteristics judgmental estimate based on various qualitative factors the table below summarizes  for the years indicated  loan balances at the end of each period  the daily averages during the period  changes in the allowance for loan losses arising from loans charged off  recoveries on loans previously charged off  additions to the allowance and certain ratios related to the allowance for loan losses allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands balances average total loans outstanding during year total loans outstanding at end of year allowance for loan losses balances at beginning of year actual charge offs real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer total charge offs recoveries on loans previously charged off real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer total recoveries net loan charge offs allowance for loan losses acquired in lbny acquisition provision for loan losses less provision for losses on off balance sheet item balance at end of year ratios net loan charge offs to average total loans allowance for loan losses to total loans at end of year net loan charge offs to allowance for loan losses at end of year net loan charge offs to provision for loan losses the table below summarizes  for the periods indicated  the balance of the allowance for loan losses and the percentage of such balance for each type of loan as of the dates indicated distribution and percentage composition of allowance for loan losses amount outstanding as of december  dollars in thousands applicable to construction real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer total allowance construction real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer total allowance contractual obligations the following table represents our aggregate contractual obligations principal and interest to make future payments as of december  dollars in thousands total one year or less over one year to three years over three years to five years over five years fhlb borrowings junior subordinated debenture operating leases time deposits total off balance sheet arrangements during the ordinary course of business  we provide various forms of credit lines to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these commitments  which represent a credit risk to us  are not represented in any form on our balance sheets 
as of december   and  we had commitments to extend credit of million  million  and million  respectively 
obligations under standby letters of credit were million  million  and million  for  and  respectively  and the obligations under commercial letters of credit were million  million  and million for the same periods 
the effect on our revenues  expenses  cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably predicted because there is no guarantee that the lines of credit will be used 
in the normal course of business  we are involved in various legal claims 
we have reviewed all legal claims against us with counsel and have taken into consideration the views of counsel as to the outcome of the claims 
in our opinion  the final disposition of all such claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
investment activities investments are one of our major sources of interest income and are acquired in accordance with a written comprehensive investment policy addressing strategies  types and levels of allowable investments 
this investment policy is reviewed at least annually by the board of directors 
management of our investment portfolio is set in accordance with strategies developed and overseen by our asset liability committee 
investment balances  including cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions  are subject to change over time based on our asset liability funding needs and interest rate risk management objectives 
our liquidity levels take into consideration anticipated future cash flows and all available sources of credits and are maintained at levels management believes are appropriate to assure future flexibility in meeting anticipated funding needs 
cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions we sell federal funds  purchase securities under agreements to resell and high quality money market instruments  and deposit interest bearing accounts in other financial institutions to help meet liquidity requirements and provide temporary holdings until the funds can be otherwise deployed or invested 
as of december   and  we had million  million and million  respectively  in federal funds sold and repurchase agreements  and   and  respectively  in interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions 
investment securities management of our investment securities portfolio focuses on providing an adequate level of liquidity and establishing an interest rate sensitive position  while earning an adequate level of investment income without taking undue risk 
we classify our investment securities as held to maturity or available for sale 
investment securities that we intend to hold until maturity are classified as held to maturity securities  and all other investment securities are classified as available for sale 
the carrying values of available for sale investment securities are adjusted for unrealized gains or losses as a valuation allowance and any gain or loss is reported on an after tax basis as a component of other comprehensive income 
at december  and  we had no mmps  but at the end of we had million in money market preferred stock mmps  which is classified as available for sale securities 
mmps is a form of equity security having characteristics similar to money market investments such as commercial paper and offers attractive tax equivalent yields with a dividend received deduction 
mmps is re auctioned every or days

as of december   held to maturity securities  which are carried at their amortized costs  decreased to million from million and million at december  and  respectively 
available for sale securities  which are stated at their fair market values  increased to million at december  from million and million at december  and  respectively 
these increases reflect a strategy of improving our liquidity level using available for sale securities  in addition to immediately available funds which are maintained mainly in the form of overnight investments 
the following tables show our investments gross unrealized losses and fair value  aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position  at december  and  respectively dollars in thousands as of december  less than months months or longer total gross gross gross unrealized unrealized unrealized description of securities fair value losses fair value losses fair value losses securities of government sponsored enterprises collateralized mortgage obligations mortgage backed securities municipal securities corporate securities as of december  less than months months or longer total gross gross gross unrealized unrealized unrealized description of securities fair value losses fair value losses fair value losses securities of government sponsored enterprises collateralized mortgage obligation mortgage backed securities municipal securities corporate securities as of december   the total unrealized losses less than months old were  and total unrealized losses more than months old were million 
the aggregate related fair value of investments with unrealized losses less than months old was million at december   and those with unrealized losses more than months old were million 
as of december   the total unrealized losses less than months old were million and total unrealized losses more than months old were million 
the aggregate related fair value of investments with unrealized losses less than months old was million at december   and those with unrealized losses more than months old were million 
declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  we consider  among other things  i the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and iii our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
we have the ability and intent to hold the securities classified as held to maturity until they mature  at which time we expect to receive full value for the securities 
as of december  and  we also had the ability and intent to hold the securities classified as available for sale for a period of time sufficient for a recovery of cost 
the unrealized losses were largely due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased 
the fair value is expected to recover as the bonds approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline 
we do not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality 
accordingly  as of december  and  we believe the impairments detailed in the table above were temporary  and no impairment loss has been realized in our consolidated statements of operations 
other earning assets for various business purposes  we make investments in earning assets other than the interest earning securities discussed above 
before  the only other earning assets held by us were insignificant amounts of federal home loan bank stock and the cash surrender value of the boli 
in an effort to provide additional benefits aimed at retaining key employees  while generating a tax exempt noninterest income stream  we purchased million in in boli from insurance carriers rated aa or above 
in  we purchased million more in boli from the same insurance carriers 
we are the owner and the primary beneficiary of the life insurance policies and recognize the increase of the cash surrender value of the policies as tax exempt other income 
in  we also invested in two low income housing tax credit funds lihtcf to promote our participation in cra activities 
we committed to invest  over two to three years  a total of million to two different lihtcf million in apollo california tax credit fund xxii  lp  and million in hudson housing los angeles revitalization fund  lp 
in  in order to promote our cra activities in each of the assessment areas in dallas  new york  and los angeles  we also committed to invest additional million  million  and million in wnc institutional tax credit fund xxi  wnc institutional tax credit fund x new york series  and wnc institutional tax credit fund x california series  respectively 
we receive the returns on these investments  over the fifteen years following the said two to three year investment periods in the form of tax credits and tax deductions 
the balances of other earning assets as of december  and december  were as follows type balance as of december  balance as of december  boli lihtcf federal home loan bank stock deposits and other sources of funds deposits deposits are our primary source of funds 
total deposits at december   and were billion  billion and billion  respectively  representing an increase of million  or  in and million  or  in the average deposits for the years ended december   and were billion  billion  and million  respectively  representing an increase of million  or  in  and of million  or  in after  our niche market depositor s preference in time deposits bearing relatively high interest rates decreased the level of deposits in transactional accounts and we increased our reliance on time deposits to fund our loan growth 
despite our efforts in controlling the growth of expensive time deposits  the percentage of the average time deposits over the average total deposits increased to and  respectively  in and as compared with in we believe that our regional diversification into the texas and new york markets together with our core deposit campaign launched late  that gives incentives to the branches achieving the assigned core deposit goals  will reduce our level of time deposit reliance going forward 
the average rate paid on time deposits in denominations of  or more increased to in as compared with in  which previously increased from in see net interest income and net interest margin for further discussion

a number of clients carry deposit balances of more than of our total deposits  but only two customers  including the california state treasury  had a deposit balance of more than of total deposits in at december  and  the california state treasury was the only depositor whose deposit balance was more than of our total deposits 
we accept brokered deposits on a selective basis at reasonable interest rates to augment deposit growth 
we have reduced these deposits to million at december  from million and million  at december  and  respectively  in order to limit our reliance on non core funding sources 
most of the brokered deposits will mature within one year 
since brokered deposits are generally less stable forms of deposits  we closely monitor growth from this non core funding source 
fhlb borrowings although deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and for general business purposes  we may obtain advances from the fhlb as an alternative to retail deposit funds 
since  we have increased borrowings from fhlb in order to take advantage of the flexibility of the program and its reasonably low cost 
see liquidity management below for the details on the fhlb borrowings program

bank level junior subordinated debenture 
in december  the bank issued a million junior subordinated debenture the debenture 
the interest rate payable on the debenture was at december   which rate adjusts quarterly to the three month libor plus 
the debenture will mature on december  interest on the debenture is payable quarterly and no scheduled payments of principal are due prior to maturity 
the bank may redeem the debenture in whole or in part at par prior to maturity on or after december  the debenture is treated as tier capital for bank regulatory capital purposes 
likewise  on a consolidated basis  the debenture also is treated as tier capital for holding company level capital purposes under current frb capital guidelines 
junior subordinated debenture  trust preferred securities issuance 
in december  wilshire bancorp was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of the bank  in order to raise additional capital funds through the issuance of trust preferred securities 
prior to the completion of the august bank holding company reorganization  wilshire bancorp organized its wholly owned subsidiary  wilshire statutory trust i  which issued million in trust preferred securities 
wilshire bancorp then purchased all of the common interest in the wilshire statutory trust i  and issued the junior subordinated debenture the debenture in the amount of approximately million to the wilshire statutory trust i with terms substantially similar to the trust preferred securities in exchange for the proceeds from the issuance of the wilshire statutory trust i s trust preferred securities and common securities 
wilshire bancorp subsequently deposited the proceeds from the debenture in a depository account at the bank and infused million as additional equity capital to the bank immediately following the holding company reorganization 
the rate of interest on the debenture and related trust preferred securities was at december   which adjusts quarterly to the three month libor plus 
the debenture and related trust preferred securities will mature on december  the interest on both the debenture and related trust preferred securities is payable quarterly and no scheduled payments of principal are due prior to maturity 
wilshire bancorp may redeem the debenture and in turn the trust preferred securities in whole or in part at par prior to maturity on or after december  march junior subordinated debenture  trust preferred securities issuance

wilshire bancorp subsequently deposited the proceeds from the march debenture in a depository account at the bank and infused million as additional equity capital to the bank 
the rate of interest on the march debenture and related trust preferred securities was at december   which adjusts quarterly to the three month libor plus 
the march debenture and related trust preferred securities will mature on march  the interest on both the march debenture and related trust preferred securities are payable quarterly and no scheduled payments of principal are due prior to maturity 
wilshire bancorp may redeem the march debenture and in turn the trust preferred securities in whole or in part at par prior to maturity on or after march  september junior subordinated debenture  trust preferred securities issuance 
in september  wilshire bancorp organized its wholly owned subsidiary  wilshire statutory trust iii  which issued million in trust preferred securities 
wilshire bancorp then purchased all of the common interest in the wilshire statutory trust iii and issued its junior subordinated debt securities the september debenture in the amount of million to the wilshire statutory trust iii with terms substantially similar to the september trust preferred securities and common securities 
wilshire bancorp subsequently deposited the proceeds from the september debenture in a depository account at the bank 
until september   the securities will be fixed at a annual interest rate  thereafter converting to a floating rate of three month libor plus  resetting quarterly 
the september debenture and related trust preferred securities will mature on september  the interest on both the september debenture and related trust preferred securities are payable quarterly and no scheduled payments of principal are due prior to maturity 
wilshire bancorp may redeem the september debenture and in turn the trust preferred securities in whole or in part at par prior to maturity on or after september  on march   the federal reserve board adopted a final rule that allows continued inclusion of trust preferred securities in the tier capital of bank holding companies  subject to stricter quantitative limits 
under the final rule  bank holding companies may include trust preferred securities in tier capital in an amount together with other restricted core capital elements equal to of the sum of core capital elements including restricted core capital elements net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability 
amounts in excess of these limits will generally be included in tier capital 
for purposes of this rule  restricted core capital elements are generally to be comprised of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  minority interest related to qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock directly issued by a consolidated us depository institution or foreign bank subsidiary  minority interest related to qualifying common stock or qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock directly issued by a consolidated subsidiary that is neither a us depository institution or a foreign bank and qualifying trust preferred securities 
the final rule provides a transition period for bank holding companies to come into compliance with these new capital restrictions 
accordingly  while the final rule became effective on april   for practical purposes  bank holding companies will have until september  an extension of the september  transition period under the proposed rule to come into compliance with the final rule s capital restrictions due to the transition period 
in extending the transition period to  the federal reserve noted that the extended period will provide bank holding companies with existing trust preferred securities with call features after the first five years an opportunity to restructure their capital elements in order to conform to the limitations of the final rule 
under the final rule  as of december   wilshire bancorp counted the full amount million of trust preferred securities as tier capital 
asset liability management management seeks to ascertain optimum and stable utilization of available assets and liabilities as a vehicle to attain our overall business plans and objectives 
in this regard  management focuses on measurement and control of liquidity risk  interest rate risk and market risk  capital adequacy  operation risk and credit risk 
see risk factors for further discussion on these risks 
information concerning interest rate risk management is set forth under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity management maintenance of adequate liquidity requires that sufficient resources be available at all time to meet our cash flow requirements 
liquidity in a banking institution is required primarily to provide for deposit withdrawals and the credit needs of its customers and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise 
liquidity management involves our ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without incurring significant loss  and to raise cash or maintain funds without incurring excessive additional cost 
for this purpose  we maintain a portion of our funds in cash and cash equivalents  deposits in other financial institutions and loans and securities available for sale 
our liquid assets at december   and totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
our liquidity level measured as the percentage of liquid assets to total assets was  and at december   and  respectively 
as a secondary source of liquidity  we rely on advances from the fhlb to supplement our supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements 
advances from the fhlb are typically secured by our mortgage loans and stock issued by the fhlb 
advances are made pursuant to several different programs 
each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
depending on the program  limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution s net worth or on the fhlb s assessment of the institution s creditworthiness 
while this fund provides flexibility and reasonable cost  we limit our use to of our borrowing capacity  as such borrowing does not qualify as core funds 
as of december   our borrowing capacity from the fhlb was about million and the outstanding balance was million  or approximately of our borrowing capacity 
as of december   we also maintained a guideline to purchase up to million and million in federal funds with bank of the west and union bank of california  respectively 
capital resources and capital adequacy requirements historically  our primary source of capital has been internally generated operating income through retained earnings 
in order to ensure adequate levels of capital  we conduct ongoing assessments of projected sources and uses of capital in conjunction with projected increases in assets and level of risks 
we have considered  and we will continue to consider  additional sources of capital as the need arises  whether through the issuance of additional equity  debt or hybrid securities 
we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we must meet specific capital guidelines that rely on quantitative measures of our assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger regulatory actions under the prompt corrective action rules that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
prompt corrective action may include regulatory enforcement actions that restrict dividend payments  require the adoption of remedial measures to increase capital  terminate fdic deposit insurance  and mandate the appointment of a conservator or receiver in severe cases 
in addition  failure to maintain a well capitalized status may adversely affect the evaluation of regulatory applications for specific transactions and activities  including acquisitions  continuation and expansion of existing activities  and commencement of new activities  and could adversely affect our business relationships with our existing and prospective clients 
the aforementioned regulatory consequences for failing to maintain adequate ratios of tier and tier capital could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
see part i  item description of business regulation and supervision capital adequacy requirements in this annual report on form k for additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements 
at december   total shareholders equity increased by million  after declaring cash dividends of million  to million from million at december  such additional capital was primarily derived from internally generated operating income million and the additional shares issued in connection with the liberty bank acquisition million 
in  total shareholders equity also grew by million from million at december   after declaring cash dividends of million  primarily from internally generated operating income of million 
our equity also increased by the share based compensation and other comprehensive income 
for the regulatory capital ratio computation purpose  we considered the junior subordinated debentures of million  which consists of million issued by the bank and million issued by the company in connection with the issuance of million trust preferred securities 
as of december   wilshire bancorp accounted for million of such securities as tier capital and million as tier capital 
as of december   the portion qualified for tier capital increased to million  reducing the portion for tier capital to million 
for the bank level  only the million debenture issued by the bank in is treated as tier capital 
see deposits and other sources of funds for further discussion regarding the capital treatment of subordinated debentures and the trust preferred securities 
as of december   we were qualified as a well capitalized institution under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action

this statement also resolves issues addressed in statement implementation issue no 
d  application of statement to beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
sfas no 
eliminates the exemption from applying sfas no 
to interests in securitized financial assets so that similar instruments are accounted for similarly regardless of the form of the instruments 
sfas no 
also allows a preparer to elect fair value measurement at acquisition  at issuance  or when a previously recognized financial instrument is subject to a remeasurement new basis event  on an instrument by instrument basis  in a case in which a derivative would otherwise have to be bifurcated 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after december  for the company 
the company does not expect the adoption sfas no 
to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements or results of operations

 accounting for servicing of financial assets  which amends the guidance in sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that an entity separately recognize a servicing asset or a servicing liability when it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset under a servicing contract in certain situations 
such servicing assets or servicing liabilities are required to be measured initially at fair value  if practicable 
sfas no 
also allows an entity to measure its servicing assets and servicing liabilities subsequently using either the amortization method  which existed under sfas no 
 or the fair value measurement method 
sfas no 
will be effective for the company in the fiscal year beginning january  the company does not expect the adoption sfas no 
to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin which supplements sfas no 
by defining the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements 
the interpretation requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date 
the more likely than not threshold represents a positive assertion by management that a company is entitled to the economic benefits of a tax position 
if a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits  no benefits of the position are to be recognized 
moreover  the more likely than not threshold must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of a benefit 
at adoption  companies must adjust their financial statements to reflect only those tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained as of the adoption date 
any necessary adjustment would be recorded directly to retained earnings in the period of adoption and reported as a change in accounting principle 
the company adopted fin on january   and this adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the company will adopt sfas no 
for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods with those fiscal years 
the transition adjustment  measured as the difference between the carrying amounts and the fair values of those financial instruments at the date sfas no 
is initially applied  should be recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for the fiscal year in which this statement is initially applied 
the company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this adoption on the consolidated financial statements or results of operations

 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  which requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the change occur through comprehensive income of the business entity 
an employer with publicly traded equity securities is required to initially recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and to provide the required disclosures 
the company adopted sfas no

has not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements or results of operations 
in september the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 quantifying financial misstatements  which expresses the staff s views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements 
registrants are required to quantify the impact of correcting all misstatements  including both the carryover and reversing effects of prior year misstatements  on the current year financial statements 
the techniques most commonly used in practice to accumulate and quantify misstatements are generally referred to as the rollover current year income statement perspective and iron curtain year end balance perspective approaches 
the financial statements would require adjustment when either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that is material  after considering all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors 
this guidance is effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after november  the adoption of sab no

impact of inflation  seasonality inflation primarily impacts us by its effect on interest rates 
our primary source of income is net interest income  which is affected by changes in interest rates 
we attempt to limit the impact of inflation on our net interest margin through management of rate sensitive assets and liabilities and the analysis of interest rate sensitivity 
the effect of inflation on premises and equipment as well as noninterest expenses has not been significant for the periods covered in this report 
our business is generally not seasonal 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in lending  investing and deposit taking activities 
we evaluate market risk pursuant to policies reviewed and approved annually by our board of directors 
the board delegates responsibility for market risk management to the asset liability management alm committee  which reports monthly to the board on activities related to market risk management 
as part of the management of our market risk  our alm committee may direct changes in the mix of assets and liabilities 
to that end  we actively monitor and manage interest rate risk exposures 
interest rate risk management involves development  analysis  implementation and monitoring of earnings to provide stable earnings and capital levels during periods of changing interest rates 
in the management of interest rate risk  we utilize monthly gap analysis and quarterly simulation modeling to determine the sensitivity of net interest income and economic value of equity 
these techniques are complementary and are used together to provide a more accurate measurement of interest rate risk 
gap analysis measures the repricing mismatches between assets and liabilities 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is determined by subtracting the amount of liabilities from the amount of assets that reprice in a particular time interval 
if repricing assets exceed repricing liabilities in any given time period  we would be deemed to be asset sensitive for that period 
conversely  if repricing liabilities exceed repricing assets  we would be deemed to be liability sensitive for that period 
the significant balance of noninterest bearing deposits puts us in an overall asset sensitive position and we strategically plan a significant three month positive gap to meet any unanticipated funding needs by maintaining a large portion of funds obtained from non interest bearing deposits in overnight investments and other cash equivalents 
in general  based upon our mix of deposits  loans and investments  increases in interest rates would be expected to increase our net interest margin 
decreases in interest rates would be expected to have the opposite effect 
however  we usually seek to maintain a balanced position over the period of one year to ensure net interest margin stability in times of volatile interest rates 
this is accomplished by maintaining a similar level of interest earning assets and interest paying liabilities available to be repriced within one year 
at december   our position appeared balanced for a one year timeframe with a negligible liability sensitive cumulative gap minus of average interest earning assets 
we do not anticipate a major change in our net interest margin as we expect such repricing gap  if occurred  to be eliminated within a year 
the change in net interest income may not always follow the general expectations of an asset sensitive or a liability sensitive balance sheet during periods of changing interest rates 
this possibility results from interest rates changing by differing increments and at different time intervals for each type of interest sensitive asset and liability 
the interest rate sensitivity gaps reported in the tables arise when assets are funded with liabilities having different repricing intervals 
since these gaps are actively managed and change daily as adjustments are made in interest rate views and market outlook  positions at the end of any period may not reflect our interest rate sensitivity in subsequent periods 
we attempt to balance longer term economic views against prospects for short term interest rate changes 
although the interest rate sensitivity gap is a useful measurement and contributes to effective asset and liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates based solely on that measure 
as a result  the alm committee also regularly uses simulation modeling as a tool to measure the sensitivity of earnings and net portfolio value npv to interest rate changes 
the npv is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
the simulation model captures all assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments and accounts for significant variables that are believed to be affected by interest rates 
these include prepayment speeds on loans  cash flows of loans and deposits  principal amortization  call options on securities  balance sheet growth assumptions and changes in rate relationships as various rate indices react differently to market rates 
although the simulation measures the volatility of net interest income and net portfolio value under immediate increase or decrease of market interest rate scenarios in basis point increments  our main concern is the negative effect of a reasonably possible worst scenario 
the alm policy prescribes that for the worst possible rate decreasing scenario the possible reduction of net interest income and npv should not exceed of the base net interest income and of the base npv  respectively 
as our simulation measures indicate below  the net interest income increases decreases as market interest rates rise fall  since we were in an overall asset sensitive position with a positive gap for the three month timeframe 
the npv increases decreases as interest income increases decreases since the change in cash flows has a greater impact on the change in the npv than does the change in the discount rate 
however the extent of such changes was within the tolerance level prescribed by our alm policy due partly to the near balanced cumulative gap for the one year timeframe 
management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate the vulnerability of our operations to changes in interest rates approximate actual experience and considers them reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities and the estimated effects of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and npv could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual experience differs from the historical experience on which they are based 
the following table sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  using the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio 
for purposes of the following table  an asset or liability is considered rate sensitive within a specified period when it can be repriced or matures within its contractual terms 
actual payment patterns may differ from contractual payment patterns

we also permit to purchase rate caps and floors and interest rate swaps  although we only engaged once in the interest rate swap agreement in september on the notional amount of million which was subsequently terminated without any gain or loss by mutual agreement between us and a brokerage company in january
