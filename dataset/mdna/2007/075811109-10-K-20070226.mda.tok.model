item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation we believe transparency and understandability are the primary goals of successful financial reporting 
we remain committed to increasing the transparency of our financial reporting  providing our stockholders with informative disclosures and presenting an accurate view of our financial position and operating results 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results 
the following md a is presented in seven sections overview strategic initiatives critical accounting estimates results of operations liquidity and capital resources off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations recent accounting developments overview we are a biomedical testing company  participating in markets that we estimate totaled billion in based on annual worldwide sales 
our company is dedicated to improving patient health and reducing the cost of care 
we address this goal by focusing on improving the efficiency of processes within laboratories 
we design  manufacture  and sell systems  services  reagents and supplies to clinical and life science laboratories around the world 
our products combine sophisticated analytical instruments  user friendly software and sensitive chemistries  integrated into complete and simple to use systems 
we simplify  automate and innovate clinical and laboratory processes so that our customers can more easily and efficiently produce accurate and precise information 
our products are used in a range of applications  from lab solutions used for pioneering medical research  clinical research and drug discovery to diagnostic systems found in hospitals and physicians offices to aid in patient care 
we market our products in more than countries  with approximately of revenue in coming from outside the united states us 
our product lines include virtually all blood tests routinely performed in hospital laboratories and a range of systems for medical and pharmaceutical research 
we have more than  systems operating in laboratories around the world 
our instruments are generally provided to customers under either operating type lease otl arrangements  sales type lease stl arrangements or cash sales 
many of our lease arrangements take the form of what are known as reagent rentals where an instrument is placed at a customer location and the customer commits to purchase a certain minimum volume of reagents annually 
we also enter into metered contracts with customers where the instrument is placed at a customer location with a stock of reagents 
the customer is then billed monthly based on actual usage of reagents 
in  we reviewed our leasing policies and in response to customer preferences decided to emphasize lease contracts with terms that resulted in more otls 
this shift to otls began in the third quarter of  and mostly impacted the united states us 
in  nearly all of our leases in the us were otls 
the revenue from otl leases in the us was million in about of our total revenue is generated by recurring revenue from supplies  test kits  services and operating type lease payments 
central laboratories of mid to large size hospitals represent our most significant customer group 
our large installed base provides us with a significant competitive advantage and drives this profitable stream of aftermarket consumables and service 
our strategy is to extend the company s leadership in simplifying  automating and innovating customer s processes  by continuing to rollout new products  enhancing our current product offerings  and entering into new and growing market segments 

table of contents placements of products serving the clinical diagnostics markets chemistry systems  immunoassay systems  the majority of products within cellular systems and some of the products within discovery and automation systems have been experiencing growth as test volumes continue to increase as a result of factors such as an aging population  increasing expenditures on chronic diseases  conditions requiring ongoing treatment for example  diabetes  aids and cancer and greater acceptance of modern medicine in emerging countries 
our customers are faced with increasing volumes of testing  a shrinking skilled labor pool and are under constant pressure to contain costs 
consequently  it has become essential for manufacturers to provide cost effective systems to remain competitive 
a large number of the products in the discovery and automation systems product area are dependent on academic research funding and capital spending in the biotechnology  pharmaceutical and clinical research markets 
we are seeing an increase in pharmaceutical and biotechnology research and development investment along with a growing need to simplify and automate testing in the research markets 
these trends have driven growth in certain areas of this market where we are focused on becoming a provider of solutions for our various customers 
products such as the unicel dxi access immunoassay system  the recently introduced unicel dxc and synchron clinical chemistry systems and the auto mate front end automation system provide our customers with a means to increase efficiency through automation and workstation consolidation 
we believe these industry leading  high throughput platforms have positioned us to gain market share and increased streams of reagent revenue in the coming years 
to further the potential of these systems  we are developing new assays internally  collaborating with external parties and pursuing business and technology acquisitions 
in hematology  we continue to automate more of the testing process with recently introduced platforms to serve both high volume hospital labs and small to mid sized labs 
our after market sales of chemistry kits  supplies and service historically have allowed us to generate substantial operating cash flows 
we have used this cash flow in the past to facilitate growth in the business by developing  marketing and launching new products through internal development as well as business and technology acquisitions 
our shift to primarily otls which began in requires additional investment in our customer leased instruments and will require an increase in our capital expenditures over the next few years until we reach a new higher level of customer leased instruments 
we expect our operating cash flows to build as our lease portfolio builds over the next few years 
we expect the majority of our lease arrangements to be otls in future years 
we have also used our operating cash flows to repurchase shares of our common stock and pay regular quarterly dividends 
in order to continue to grow  gain market share and remain competitive  we must continue to introduce new instrument and reagent technologies and remain at the forefront in helping customers advance medical science  improve patient outcomes and reduce overall healthcare costs 
to remain competitive we must also acquire and defend intellectual property and invest in research and development 
otherwise  our current products could become technologically obsolete over time 
while we believe that our cash flow will enable us to continue to fund these activities  we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could hamper our efforts to successfully increase market share and expand into new markets 
among other factors  those risks include general worldwide economic weakness  pressure on healthcare spending  constrained government research funding and our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for new products 
we believe we are addressing these risks by providing our customers automated and cost effective solutions 
a large number of our products require marketing authorizations from the fda and similar agencies in other countries 
we believe that we have effective quality and compliance programs in place and have been successful in obtaining the necessary clearances for our new products from the fda and other similar agencies 
acquisition on november   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of lumigen  inc lumigen  a world leading developer and manufacturer of novel detection chemistries for high sensitivity testing in clinical diagnostics and life science research for a purchase price of approximately million 
lumigen s chemiluminescent chemistry is the detection method used in our access family of immunoassay systems 
the acquisition was financed through a million bridge loan  which was subsequently repaid with proceeds from our convertible notes offering in december 
table of contents debt issuance and repayment on june   approximately million of our million debentures  bearing an interest rate of per annum due june   were tendered to us for repayment by the holders of the debentures 
the debentures were put to us under terms of the indenture governing the debenture agreement that allowed them to be repaid  in whole or in part  on june  at a redemption price of 
in connection with this redemption we incurred million in debt extinguishment costs 
on december   we finalized our convertible notes offering and issued convertible notes convertible notes  for an aggregate principal amount of million in a private placement transaction to certain qualified institutional buyers 
the convertible notes are due december and carry an interest rate of that is payable semiannually and  under certain circumstances  beginning with the six month period beginning december   contingent interest 
additionally  the convertible notes have a conversion feature that will allow the holders of the convertible notes to convert  in increments of  principal  their investment into shares of our common stock equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of common stock  subject to adjustment 
in certain circumstances  the convertible notes may be convertible into cash up to the principal amount and  if applicable  shares of common stock with respect to any excess conversion value 
holders of the convertible notes may require us to repurchase all or part of their notes on december      and or upon the occurrence of certain designated events 
also  on or after december   we may redeem all or part of the convertible notes 
upon such events  we will repurchase or redeem such convertible notes for cash at a price equal to of the principal amount of the convertible notes being repurchased or redeemed  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the proceeds from the issuance of the convertible notes were used to redeem million of the senior notes  to repay the million bridge loan obtained to fund the lumigen acquisition  and to repay million of the outstanding amount on our credit facility 
proceeds were also used to repurchase million of our common stock approximately million shares 
we recorded debt discounts and issuance costs of million and a debt extinguishment loss of million as a result of the debt redemption 
lastly  related to the contingent interest feature on the convertible notes  we recorded a liability for the value of the embedded derivative in the amount of million 
see note debt financing of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
reorganization and restructuring during the fourth quarter  we completed our one company reorganization initiative  which we began in the objective of the reorganization was to better enable us to leverage personnel  technologies and products by combining our two divisions in a single company structure 
as part of our reorganization plans  we exited certain products and products under development 
significant projects that we decided to exit included a test under development for the detection of bovine spongiform encephalopathy mad cow disease  two lower priority investments in the cellular product area  an immunoassay for the detection and management of sepsis  and certain non core product lines in discovery and automation 
related to the above projects and product lines  as well as other less significant products  we recorded charges of and million in and  respectively  to write off patents  licenses and other related assets 
charges of and million in and  respectively  were also recorded in cost of goods sold for inventory write offs related to the products that we are no longer offering 
we terminated approximately employees worldwide as a result of the reorganization and in recorded a charge for approximately million for severance and related benefits for affected employees and other exit and contract termination costs 
additional charges of million were incurred in strategic initiatives our strategic initiatives for are focused on our key growth drivers and operational improvements we are working to expand our consumables menu  particularly in immunoassay  and believe that our focus on certain disease states will enable us to deliver enhanced testing capability to our customers  which will ultimately improve patient health 

table of contents we are building on our ability to help customers simplify  automate and innovate their processes 
our process leadership in customers laboratories supports our expansion of automation and work cells  expanding our installed base of instruments 
from a geographic perspective  we are expanding resources in emerging markets  including china and india  which we believe will improve our opportunities for long term growth 
we have announced the closure of our manufacturing site in palo alto  california and the relocation of those operations to indianapolis  indiana 
we expect that the closure of our palo alto site will cost approximately million over the next two years  including million for employee severance in we expect to begin realizing benefits from the relocation in we intend to continue to streamline our supply chain operations to improve our overall cost structure over the next three years 
we are expanding our use of lean six sigma tools throughout the company as a result of our initial success with these tools in a pilot project in our chaska  minnesota facility 
we have announced that we plan to design and build automated  fully integrated molecular diagnostic systems for clinical laboratories 
costs for the project are anticipated to be about to million per year through  excluding any licensing fees for test menu 
we expect the interest savings from the debt refinancing in december will offset a significant portion of these costs 
as part of our strategic initiatives  we expect to incur charges for supply chain management as we realign our manufacturing and distribution footprint and implement initiatives to improve productivity and reduce operating costs in the future
