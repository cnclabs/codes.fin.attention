item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes included elsewhere in this annual report and the section risk factors in item a  as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this report  before deciding to purchase  sell or hold our common stock 
company overview we are a leading provider of technology and services for digital video recorders 
the subscription based tivo service redefines home entertainment by providing consumers with an easy way to record  watch  and control television and receive videos  pictures  and movies from cable  broadcast  and broadband sources 
we offer such features as season pass recordings  wishlist searches  tivotogo transfers  tivocast content which includes premium content delivered from amazon unbox  tivo kidzone  tivo online scheduling  and tivo product watch 
as of january   there were approximately million subscriptions to the tivo service 
we distribute the tivo service through consumer electronics retailers and through our on line store at tivo 
com 
additionally  we provide the tivo service through agreements with leading television service providers such as satellite television providers  including currently directv and in the future cable television operators  such as comcast and cox  and digital subscriber line  dsl  providers such as bellsouth and earthlink 
we also provide innovative marketing solutions for the television industry  including a unique platform for advertisers and audience research measurement 

table of contents executive overview and outlook of financial results during the fiscal year ended january   we experienced growth in our tivo owned subscription base and subscription revenues 
through our continued investment in marketing and research and development  we increased our tivo owned subscription base 
however  this subscription growth was largely offset by the loss of a portion of our directv installed subscription base 
additionally  in fiscal year we elected to invest in subscription acquisition activities in an effort to expand our subscription base and promote the tivo brand for future partnerships 
tivo owned subscription gross additions for the fiscal year were  which was down from the fiscal year for the fiscal year ending january   we plan to lower our consumer hardware rebates offerings thereby reducing our rebates  revenues share and other payments to channel and we will redirect a portion of those funds towards advertising expenditures to promote the tivo brand and service  which will increase our sales and marketing expenses 
in fiscal year  we expect to continue to grow our tivo owned subscription base  however  we expect this growth to continue to be offset by losses in our directv subscription installed base as directv no longer markets the tivo service to its customers as of february we anticipate fiscal year will have continued service revenue growth as our tivo owned subscription base increases and our advertising sales business grows 
this service revenue growth will be somewhat offset by the continued decline of product lifetime subscription related revenues as they become fully recognized coupled with a decline in directv related service revenues due to further losses in our directv subscription installed base 
development and deployment of the tivo service software solution for comcast and cox are expected to launch in initial markets during fiscal year during fiscal year  we expect to recognize technology revenue associated with the development work from our comcast and cox agreements 
the following table sets forth selected information as of our fiscal years ended january    and fiscal year ended january  in thousands service and technology revenues net revenues cost of revenues operating expenses loss from operations cash flows from operating activities service and technology revenues 
our service and technology revenues  which include subscription fees received for the tivo service  advertising fees  and engineering and licensing fees  increased million or during the fiscal year ended january  compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in our cumulative tivo owned subscription installed base of approximately  net tivo owned subscriptions during the fiscal year ended january   coupled with million in technology revenues from licensing and engineering work recognized from our comcast agreement 
net revenues 
in addition to service and technology revenues  our net revenues include our hardware revenues as well as any offsetting effects of contra revenue such as rebates  revenue shares  and other payments to channel 
net revenues increased by million or during the fiscal year ended january  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase of million in hardware revenues in absolute dollars is attributed to increased sales to our new and existing retail channel customers and the rollout of our new tivo series dt and from our new tivo series hd dmr models 
cost of revenues 
our total costs of revenues  which include cost of service revenues  cost of technology revenues  and cost of hardware revenues  increased by million or during the 
table of contents fiscal year ended january  the cost of service and technology revenues for the fiscal year ended january  increased by million  or  compared to the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of million in technology costs related to comcast coupled with increased costs associated with our growing tivo owned subscription base 
the cost of hardware revenues for the fiscal year ended january  increased by million  or  compared to the prior fiscal year  primarily due to increased hardware shipments related to our introduction of two new dvr models during the year 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses  including research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses  increased million or during the fiscal year ended january  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the largest contributor to the increase in operating expenses for the fiscal year end january  was non cash stock compensation expense of million  compared to  in the prior year 
this increase of million was largely due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas r  share based payments 
cash flows from operating activities 
our cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended january  was million  as compared to million provided by operating activities for the prior fiscal year 
this change in cash flows used in operating activities is largely due to the increase in our net loss coupled with increased inventory spending and reduction of deferred revenues due to the company s decision to discontinue general sale of the product lifetime subscription service 
key business metrics management periodically reviews certain key business metrics in order to evaluate our operations  allocate resources  and drive financial performance in our business 
management monitors these metrics together and not individually as it does not make business decisions based upon any single metric 
subscriptions 
management reviews this metric  and believes it may be useful to investors  in order to evaluate our relative position in the marketplace and to forecast future potential service revenues 
below is a table that details the growth in our subscription base during the past eight quarters 
the tivo owned lines refer to subscriptions sold directly by tivo to consumers who have tivo enabled dvrs 
the directv lines refer to subscriptions sold by directv to consumers who have integrated directv satellite receivers with tivo service 
additionally  we provide a breakdown of the percent of tivo owned subscriptions for which consumers pay recurring fees  including on a monthly and a prepaid one  two  or three year basis  as opposed to a one time prepaid product lifetime fee 
three months ended subscriptions in thousands jan  oct  july  april  jan  oct  jul  april  tivo owned subscription gross additions subscription net additions tivo owned directv total subscription net additions cumulative subscriptions tivo owned directv total cumulative subscriptions fully amortized active lifetime subscriptions of tivo owned cumulative subscriptions paying recurring fees we define a subscription as a contract referencing a tivo enabled dvr for which i a consumer has paid for the tivo service and ii service is not canceled 
we previously offered a 
table of contents product lifetime subscription for general sale  under which consumers could purchase a subscription that is valid for the lifetime of a particular dvr 
we count these as subscriptions until both of the following conditions are met i the four year period we use to recognize lifetime subscription revenues ends  and ii the related dvr has not made contact to the tivo service within the prior six month period 
lifetime subscriptions past the four year mark which have not called into the tivo service for six months are not counted in this total 
we are not aware of any uniform standards for defining subscriptions and caution that our presentation may not be consistent with that of other companies 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we discontinued general sale of the product lifetime service option 
tivo owned subscription net additions increased by  subscriptions  bringing the tivo owned installed subscription base to million subscriptions for the fiscal year ended january  tivo owned subscription net additions for the fiscal year ended january  decreased by  compared to the same prior fiscal year period we believe  largely due to an increase in churn resulting from a larger subscription base and because of increased competition from dvrs distributed by cable and satellite providers  including directv s non tivo products  and the increasing importance of high definition television 
the percent of cumulative tivo owned subscriptions on a monthly or prepay plan increased  by to during the quarter ended january   as compared to the same prior year period 
directv installed subscription base decreased by  subscriptions to million subscriptions as of january  as compared to the same prior year period 
this decrease is due to directv s promotion of a competing dvr service from nds 
as of january   approximately  product lifetime subscriptions had exceeded the four year period we use to recognize product lifetime subscription revenues  but had made contact to the tivo service within the prior six months  such tivo product lifetime subscriptions represent approximately of our cumulative lifetime subscriptions as compared to for the fiscal year ended january  we continue to incur costs of services for these subscriptions without recognizing corresponding subscription revenues 
tivo owned churn rate per month 
management reviews this metric  and believes it may be useful to investors  in order to evaluate our ability to retain existing tivo owned subscriptions including both monthly and product lifetime subscriptions by providing services that are competitive in the market 
management believes factors such as service enhancements  service commitments  higher customer satisfaction  and improved customer support may improve this metric 
conversely  management believes factors such as increased competition  lack of competitive service features such as high definition television recording capabilities  for our primary product offerings  and increased price sensitivity may cause our tivo owned churn rate per month to increase 
we define the tivo owned churn rate per month as the total tivo owned subscription cancellations in the period divided by the average tivo owned subscriptions for the period including both monthly and product lifetime subscriptions  which then is divided by the number of months in the period 
we calculate average tivo owned subscriptions for the period by adding the average tivo owned subscriptions for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period 
we calculate the average tivo owned subscriptions for each month by adding the beginning and ending subscriptions for the month and dividing by two 
we are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating churn and caution that our presentation may not be consistent with that of other companies 

table of contents the following table presents our tivo owned churn rate per month information fiscal year ended january  in thousands  accept percentages tivo owned subscription cancellations average tivo owned subscriptions annual churn rate number of months tivo owned churn rate per month the tivo owned churn rate per month was for the fiscal year ended january  compared to 
and 
for the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
the tivo owned churn rate per month of for the fiscal year ended january  is primarily comprised of cancellations of recurring subscriptions 
we also count as churn those product lifetime subscriptions that have both reached the end of the four year revenue recognition period and whose dvrs have not contacted the tivo service within the prior six months 
conversely  we do not count as churn product lifetime subscriptions that have not reached the end of the four year revenue recognition period  regardless of whether such subscriptions continue to contact the tivo service 
we anticipate our tivo owned churn rate per month will increase in future periods as a result of increased competition in the marketplace  competitive pricing issues  the growing importance of offering competitive service features such as high definition television recording capabilities  and increased churn from product lifetime subscriptions 
subscription acquisition cost or sac 
management reviews this metric  and believes it may be useful to investors  in order to evaluate trends in the efficiency of our marketing programs and subscription acquisition strategies 
we define sac as our total acquisition costs for a given period divided by tivo owned subscription gross additions for the same period 
we define total acquisition costs as the sum of sales and marketing expenses  rebates  revenue share  and other payments to channel  minus hardware gross margin defined as hardware revenues less cost of hardware revenues 
this includes all fixed costs including headcount related expense  such as stock based compensation  marketing not directly associated with subscription acquisition  operating expenses for the advertising sales business  and allocations 
we do not include directv subscription gross additions in our calculation of sac because we incur limited or no acquisition costs for new directv subscriptions 
we are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating total acquisition costs or sac and caution that our presentation may not be consistent with that of other companies 
fiscal year ended january  subscription acquisition costs sales and marketing expenses rebates  revenue share  and other payments to channel hardware revenues cost of hardware revenues total acquisition costs tivo owned subscription gross additions subscription acquisition costs sac during the twelve months ended january   our total acquisition costs were million and sac was comparatively  total acquisition costs for the twelve months ended january  and were million and million  respectively and sac was and  respectively 
sac increased by or for the twelve months ended january  compared to the prior year period primarily due to our new multi tiered pricing structure and bundled 
table of contents sales program that we implemented in march which includes a reduced priced tivo dvr in exchange for a customer commitment to either a one  two  or three year service plan combined with higher hardware rebate offers that were available to consumers 
as a result of the seasonal nature of our subscription growth  sac varies significantly during the year 
management primarily reviews this metric on an annual basis due to the timing difference between our recognition of promotional program expenses and the subsequent addition of the related subscription acquisition 
for example  we have historically incurred increased sales and marketing expenses during our third quarter in anticipation of new subscriptions that may be added during the fourth quarter and in subsequent periods in addition to those added during the third quarter 
average revenue per subscription or arpu 
management reviews this metric  and believes it may be useful to investors  in order to evaluate the potential of our subscription base to generate revenues from a variety of sources  including subscription fees  advertising  and audience research measurement 
arpu does not include rebates  revenue share and other payments to channel that reduce our gaap revenues 
additionally  under the accounting policy for our bundled sales program  revenues associated with these bundled sales transactions  a portion of which were previously recognized as hardware revenues  are now being recognized in service revenues 
as a result  you should not use arpu as a substitute for measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with gaap 
management believes it is useful to consider this metric excluding the costs associated with rebates  revenue share and other payments to channel because of the discretionary and varying nature of these expenses and because management believes these expenses are more appropriately monitored as part of sac 
we are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating arpu and caution that our presentation may not be consistent with that of other companies 
we calculate arpu per month for tivo owned subscriptions by subtracting directv related service revenues which includes directv subscription service revenues and directv related advertising revenues from our total reported service revenues and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
we then divide by average tivo owned subscriptions for the period  calculated as described above for churn rate 
the following table shows this calculation and reconciles arpu for tivo owned subscriptions to our reported service and technology revenues fiscal year ended january  tivo owned average revenue per subscription in thousands  except arpu service and technology revenues less technology revenues total service revenues less directv related service revenues tivo owned related service revenues average tivo owned revenues per month average tivo owned per month subscriptions tivo owned arpu per month tivo owned arpu per month for the fiscal year ended january  decreased from fiscal year ended january  and increased from fiscal year ended january  to from and from  respectively 
the decrease in tivo owned arpu for the fiscal year ended january  was due to an increase of  tivo owned product lifetime subscriptions that reached the end of the four year period we use to recognize lifetime subscription revenue  as compared to the same prior year period 
however  this decrease in tivo owned arpu due to the increase in fully amortized and still active product lifetime subscriptions was partially offset by our new multi tiered pricing structure and bundled sales program which yielded a higher monthly subscription rate for new tivo owned subscriptions 
we expect the number of fully amortized and still active product lifetime subscriptions to increase in fiscal year ended january  the increase of 
for the fiscal year ended january  was largely due to increased volume of monthly subscriptions as compared to the same prior year period 

table of contents we calculate arpu per month for directv subscriptions by first subtracting tivo owned related service revenues which includes tivo owned subscription service revenues and tivo owned related advertising revenues from our total reported service revenues 
then we divide average revenues per month for directv related service revenues by average subscriptions for the period 
the following table shows this calculation and reconciles arpu for directv subscriptions to service and technology revenues fiscal year ended january  directv average revenue per subscription in thousands  except arpu service and technology revenues less technology revenues total service revenues less tivo owned related service revenues directv related service revenues average directv revenues per month average directv per month subscriptions directv arpu per month for fiscal year  pursuant to the recently amended directv agreement  tivo deferred a portion of the directv subscription fees equal to the fair value of the undelivered development services 
otherwise the recurring subscriptions fees in this agreement are similar to the recurring monthly per household fees for the households with directv receivers with tivo service activated since arpu per month for directv subscriptions for the fiscal year ended january  decreased from the same year prior periods to from and  respectively 
the decrease for fiscal year ended january  was largely a result of the deferred directv revenues described above  which impacted arpu by a decrease of 
the decrease in arpu for fiscal year ended january  as compared to the same prior year period was a result of acquiring subscriptions at lower recurring revenues than subscriptions added during earlier phases of our directv relationship 
in fiscal  we expect arpu per month for directv subscriptions to decrease further as the term of our seventh amendment of our development agreement continues 
under the seventh amendment  after february   directv will pay us a monthly fee for all directv households with tivo receivers similar to the lower amount paid by directv for households with directv receivers with tivo service deployed since march   subject to a monthly minimum payment by directv 
we will continue to defer a portion of these fees as a non refundable credit to fund mutually agreed development  maintenance  and support services  which may potentially be offset by increased advertising revenues in the future 
critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates are those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties  and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we base our discussion and analysis on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles as described in item note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we 
table of contents base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of this analysis form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates  see item note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
recognition period for product lifetime subscriptions revenues 
tivo previously offered a product lifetime subscription option for general sale for the life of the dvr for a one time  prepaid payment 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we discontinued general sale of the product lifetime service option 
we recognize subscription revenues from product lifetime subscriptions ratably over a four year period  based on our estimate of the useful life of these dvrs 
as of january    product lifetime subscriptions had exceeded the four year period we use to recognize product lifetime subscription revenues and had made contact with the tivo service within the prior six month period 
this represents approximately of our cumulative lifetime subscriptions as compared to for the fiscal year ended january  during fiscal year  we will continue to monitor the useful life of a tivo enabled dvr and the impact of higher churn  increased competition and compatibility of our existing tivo units with high definition programming 
further analysis will allow us to determine if our useful life is shorter or longer than four years  in which case we may revise the estimated life and we would recognize revenues from this source over a shorter or longer period 
engineering services project cost estimates 
for engineering services that are essential to the functionality of the software or involve significant customization or modification  we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method  as described in statement of position sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we recognize revenue by measuring progress toward completion based on the ratio of costs  principally labor  incurred to total estimated costs of the project  an input method 
in general  these contracts are long term and complex 
we believe we are able to make reasonably dependable estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates include forecasting of costs and schedules  estimating contract revenue related to contract performance  projecting cost to complete  tracking progress of costs incurred to date  and projecting the remaining effort to complete the project 
costs included in engineering services are labor  materials  and overhead related to the specific activities that are required for the project 
costs related to general infrastructure or platform development are not included in the engineering services project cost estimates 
these estimates are assessed continually during the term of the contract and revisions are reflected when the conditions become known 
in some cases  we have accepted engineering services contracts that were expected to be losses at the time of acceptance 
provisions for all losses on contracts are recorded when estimates determine that a loss will be incurred on a contract 
using different cost estimates  or different methods of measuring progress to completion  engineering services revenues and expenses may produce materially different results 
a favorable change in estimates in a period could result in additional revenue and profit  and an unfavorable change in estimates could result in a reduction of revenue and profit or the recording of a loss that would be borne solely by tivo 
for the fiscal year ended january  the majority of our technology revenues are related to the comcast development agreement and are offset by an equal amount of development cost recognized as cost of technology revenues 
consumer rebate redemption rate 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  we record an estimated potential liability for our consumer rebate program that is based on the percentage of customers that were reimbursed for the rebate for similar past programs and adjust estimates to consider actual redemptions 
currently  the estimated redemption rate for the rebate program is based on historical redemptions for previous rebate programs 
starting november   the company had new rebate programs which offer a rebate of for a dual tuner dvr unit and for a single tuner dvr unit 
the estimated weighted average redemption rate for these programs is 
starting february   the rebate 
table of contents amount was lowered to for a dual tuner dvr unit and for a single tuner dvr unit 
during the fiscal year ended january   we recorded a total charge of million  of which million related to our earlier rebate programs and million related to the rebate programs announced in november and february as of january   million remains accrued on the company s balance sheet 
a one percentage point deviation in our redemption rebate estimate would have resulted in an increase or decrease in our rebate liability as of january  of approximately  upon full completion of consumer rebate programs  any unredeemed consumer rebate expense will be reversed 
these consumer rebates and sales incentives programs are recognized as rebates  revenue share  and other payments to channel in our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of inventory 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the first in  first out method 
we base write downs of inventories upon current facts and circumstances and determine net realizable value on an aggregate pool basis 
we perform a detailed assessment of excess and obsolete inventory and purchase commitments at each balance sheet date  which includes a review of  among other factors  demand requirements and market conditions 
based on this analysis  we record adjustments  when appropriate  to reflect inventory of finished products and materials on hand at lower of cost or market and to reserve for products or materials which are not forecasted to be used 
we also record accruals for charges that represent management s estimate of the company s exposure to the contract manufacturer for excess non cancelable purchase commitments 
as of january   we impaired million in inventory and reserved approximately  for excess non cancelable purchase commitments 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of product demand and pricing assumptions  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments would significantly impact the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
in the future  if we find that our estimates are too optimistic and determine that our inventory needs to be written down further  we will be required to recognize such costs in our cost of revenue at the time of such determination 
conversely  if we find our estimates are too pessimistic and we subsequently sell product that has previously been written down  our gross margin in that period will be favorably impacted 
valuation of stock based compensation 
on february   we adopted the provisions of sfas r  share based payment  requiring us to recognize expense related to the fair value of our stock based compensation awards 
sfas no 
r eliminates the option to account for stock based compensation transactions with employees using the intrinsic value method under accounting principle board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and instead requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
the fair value of our restricted stock awards was calculated based on the fair market value of our stock at the grant date 
sfas no 
r requires the use of a valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock based awards 
we have elected to use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options and espp awards 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award and interest rates 
the expected volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock 
the expected life of an award is based on the simplified calculation of expected life as defined by staff accounting bulletin sab  share based payment 
the interest rate is based on the average of us treasury yield curve on investments with lives approximating the term during the fiscal quarter an option is granted 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can affect our gross margin  research and development expenses  sales and marketing expenses  and general and administrative expenses 
the expense we recognize in future periods could also differ from the current period and or our forecasts due to adjustments in the assumed forfeiture rates 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in september  the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on the sec s views regarding the process of quantifying materiality of financial statement misstatements 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework and gives guidance regarding the methods used for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on its consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the interpretation contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   which will be the company s fiscal year  and is required to be recognized as a change in accounting principle through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption 
the company estimates that the adoption of fin will not have a significant impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb ratified the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
eitf issue no 
requires that the presentation of taxes within revenue producing transactions between a seller and a customer  including but not limited to sales  use  value added  and some excise taxes  should be on either a gross included in revenue and cost or a net excluded from revenue basis 
in addition  for any such taxes that are reported on a gross basis  a company should disclose the amounts of those taxes in interim and annual financial statements for each period for which an income statement is presented if those amounts are significant 
the disclosure of those taxes can be done on an aggregate basis 
eitf issue no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   which will be the company s fiscal year eitf will not impact the method for recording these sales taxes in the company s consolidated financial statements as the company has historically presented sales excluding all taxes and the company currently has no plan to change its method of revenue reporting 
results of operations net revenues 
our net revenues for the fiscal years ended january    and as a percentage of total net revenues were as follows fiscal year ended january  in thousands  except percentages service revenues technology revenues hardware revenues rebates  revenue share  and other payments to channel net revenues change from same prior year period 
table of contents of the total service revenues and technology revenues for the fiscal year ended january   million was generated from related parties 
no revenues were generated from related parties in the fiscal years ended january  or service revenues 
service revenues for the fiscal year ended january  increased or million over the service revenues for the fiscal year ended january  this increase was primarily due to the year over year growth in our tivo owned subscription base 
during the fiscal year ended january  we added  net tivo owned subscriptions bringing the total installed base to over million as of january  service revenues for the year ended january  were million  higher than the service revenues for the year ended january  during the fiscal year ended january   we added million net subscriptions to the tivo service 
consumer demand for tivo enabled dvr and dvd products was driven by broad availability and strong support in the retail channel  consumer rebate programs  and increased consumer awareness of the tivo service 
we intend to generate continued tivo owned subscription growth by managing our relationships with leading retailers such as best buy  circuit city  radio shack  and others and by launching advertising campaigns directed at growing our subscription base 
we anticipate fiscal year will have continued service revenue growth as our tivo owned subscription installed base increases and our advertising sales business grows  however  we expect to see a decrease in directv related service revenues in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year technology revenues 
in the fiscal year ended january   we derived of our net revenues  or million  from licensing and engineering services compared to of our net revenues  or million  in the prior fiscal year 
technology revenues for the fiscal year ended january  were  or million higher than the prior fiscal year end largely due to revenues of million in revenues recognized from engineering services related to our agreement with comcast  of which million is related to services performed in fiscal year  and was offset by an equal amount of development expense recognized as cost of technology revenues 
technology revenues for fiscal year were lower than the fiscal year as engineering services for existing contracts were completed and engineering services related to our agreements with comcast had not yet begun 
additionally  in fiscal year  we determined that we needed to incur million of development costs related to a loss contract deemed substantially complete in fiscal year as a result  we recorded a total charge of million to the statement of operations in the three months ended july  of which  was a reduction in technology revenues and  was an increase in costs of technology revenues 
technology revenues for the twelve months ended january  were largely a result of amortization of deferred revenue on existing license contracts 

table of contents hardware revenues 
hardware revenues  net of allowance for sales returns  for the fiscal year ended january  was of our net revenues compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in hardware revenues in absolute dollars is attributed to increased sales to our new and existing retail channel customers and the rollout of our new tivo series dt and tivo series hd dmr models  which was partially offset by lower hardware prices under our bundled sales programs 
for the fiscal year ended january   hardware revenues were of our net revenues compared to for the prior fiscal year 
for the fiscal year ended january   the decrease in hardware revenues was largely a result of decreased hardware sales volume due to increased competition from directv s tivo products  as well as from other dvr distributors and cable and service providers 
additionally  the average selling price has declined year over year due to consumer incentive programs  including one program which offered a free dvr with the purchase of an annual or product lifetime product subscription 
for the fiscal years ended january    and  one retail customer generated million  million  and million of hardware revenues or   and of net revenues  respectively 
rebates  revenue share  and other payments to channel 
we recognize certain marketing related payments as a reduction of revenues in our consolidated statements of operations 
these reductions are recorded based on an estimated potential liability for our consumer rebate program  which is based on the percentage of customers that were reimbursed for the rebate for similar past programs and then we adjust estimates to reflect actual redemptions 
rebates  revenue share  and other payments to channel increased by million or for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to the same prior year period 
in the fiscal year ended january   we had an increase of million in rebate expense due to higher hardware rebates amounts offered and an increased redemption rate 
this increase was largely offset by a decrease of million in marketing development funds and million in tivo rewards expense 
for the fiscal year ended january   rebates  revenue share  and other payments to channel decreased by million  as compared to the same prior fiscal year period 
the primary contributor to the decrease in rebates  revenue share  and other payments to channel for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to the prior fiscal year was lower than expected rebate expenses due to fewer programs offered in the first half of fiscal year in addition  we had a reversal of million of rebate expense during the six months ended july   which was primarily a result of a truing up the rebate accruals established in fiscal year  for certain rebate programs that ended during the three months ended april  consumer rebate expenses were million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended january    and  respectively 
for the fiscal year ending january   we plan to lower our consumer hardware rebate offerings thereby reducing our rebates  revenues share and other payments to channel

although we currently anticipate these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our cash needs through the next twelve months  we may require or choose to obtain additional financing 
our ability to obtain financing will depend  among other things  on our development efforts  business plans  operating performance  and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required  or at all 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity  equity linked or debt securities  those securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock  and our stockholders may experience dilution
