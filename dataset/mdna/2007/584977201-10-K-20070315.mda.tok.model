executive overview our business we are engaged primarily in distinct  but very much related businesses  which for financial reporting purposes are divided into two reportable segments laboratory services and product sales 
for financial information relating to our segments  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
laboratory services our laboratory services business segment includes the activities of our wholly owned subsidiary  medtox laboratories  inc medtox laboratories  inc principally engages in forensic toxicology primarily laboratory testing for identification of drugs of abuse  providing these services to private and public companies  drug treatment counseling centers  occupational health clinics and hospitals  as well as third party administrators 
our specialty laboratory services operations consist of clinical toxicology  clinical testing for the pharmaceutical industry eg  central laboratory services  bioanalytical  and pharmacokinetic testing  and analysis of heavy and trace metals 
we provide these services to hospitals  clinics  hmos and small to mid sized biotech and pharmaceutical companies and other laboratories 
testing is conducted using methodologies that include various immunoassays  gas liquid chromatography  gas chromatography mass spectrometry  and high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry 
we also provide services in the areas of logistics management  data management and program management 
these services support our underlying business of laboratory analysis and provide added value to our clients 
the laboratory services segment also includes new brighton business center  llc  a wholly owned limited liability company formed for the sole purpose of acquiring the facilities in st 
paul  minnesota  where our laboratory services administrative offices and laboratory operations are located 
these facilities include other commercial tenants that have individual leases with terms of up to ten years 
product sales our product sales business segment consists of our wholly owned subsidiary  medtox diagnostics  inc medtox diagnostics  inc 
is engaged in the development  manufacturing  and distribution of a variety of point of collection testing poct diagnostic drug screening devices  such as our profile ii  profile ii a  profile iii  profile ii er  medtoxscan reader  verdict ii  and sure screen products  in addition to a variety of agricultural testing products and other diagnostic tests for the detection of alcohol 
medtox diagnostics  inc also provides contract manufacturing services  such as coagulation market controls 
the operations of the product sales segment are located in burlington  north carolina  where we maintain the offices  research and development laboratories  production operations  and warehouse distribution facilities 
key trends influencing our operating results our management believes that there are several notable trends that are currently influencing  and are expected in the foreseeable future to continue to influence  our operating results 
these include consolidation in the laboratory services  drugs of abuse business the laboratory services  drugs of abuse industry is consolidating 
the consolidation is being driven by customers desires to minimize the number of laboratories with which they work  the need for operating efficiencies in the form of critical mass testing volumes  required investment levels and government regulation 
given the competitive environment  we are increasingly seeking to differentiate ourselves through our technology and value added services  such as  data management  collection site management  training  and technical support and expertise 
economic uncertainties causing variability in testing volumes in the laboratory services  drugs of abuse business in the second quarter of  we experienced a decrease in testing volume from our existing workplace drugs of abuse clients  which we primarily attributed to lower new job creation and reduced employee turnover caused by economic uncertainties 
in the third quarter of  testing volume from our existing workplace drugs of abuse clients was level with the prior year period 
in the fourth quarter of  testing volume from our existing workplace drugs of abuse clients was slightly higher than the prior year period 
we feel economic uncertainties may continue to cause variability in our workplace drugs of abuse testing volume in the foreseeable future 
increased poct diagnostic device test competition we have experienced increased competition with respect to our poct diagnostic tests from systems and products developed by others  many of whom compete solely on price 
as the number of firms marketing diagnostic tests has grown  we have experienced increased price competition for certain diagnostic testing devices  particularly in the probation  parole and rehabilitation market 
our strategy we believe that the combined operations of our laboratory services business and on site test kits manufactured by the product sales segment have created synergy in the marketing of comprehensive  on site and laboratory testing programs to a common customer base 
our combined operations allow us to offer a full line of products and services for the substance abuse testing and occupational medicine marketplace 
these include on site tests for the detection of substance of abuse drugs  substance abuse mental health services administration samhsa certified laboratory testing screening and confirmation  biological monitoring of occupational toxins  consultation and logistics  data management  and program management services 
our strategy is to build market share by offering the highest quality products and services  delivered rapidly  priced competitively  and supported by value added services 
these services include data management  collection site management  training  technical support and expertise  as well as policy review 
in the data management area  we have a new service echain  our web based electronic chain of custody and donor tracking system 
we have over  clinics and collection sites utilizing echain throughout the country 
these sites will serve as the basis for a marketing campaign to offer echain to national clients beginning in in  we developed and introduced medtoxscan  an electronic reader  for use with our profile ii er poct device in hospital laboratories and emergency rooms 
approximately readers have been shipped and response from our distributor  cardinal health  and end using customers has been very good 
poct devices introduced in  including sure screen  our lower detection level poct device targeted for the government and rehabilitation markets and our profile iii device  an integrated cup and testing device for sale to the workplace drug testing market  are gaining acceptance and have been increasing in sales month over month 
in july  we were awarded a contract to provide our clearcourse solution to the los angeles county probation department 
our clearcourse solution includes both laboratory and point of collection drug screening  utilizing the company s verdict ii and new sure screen devices  with the lowest detection levels of any fda cleared product 
the contract term is one year with four one year extensions 
the annual revenue from the contract is estimated at approximately million per year  but is not guaranteed past year of the contract 
we began providing services under the contract late in the third quarter of initially  the revenue will be derived primarily from our laboratory services business 
moving forward  a greater percentage of revenue will be shifted to the sale of our poct devices 
we have expanded the number of sales representatives in our sales group from to  to increase new sales activity in response to uncertain economic conditions that may result in lower activity from existing workplace drugs of abuse clients 
we have committed to improve productivity and quality in our organization through lean and six sigma processes 
our lean and six sigma initiatives are designed to improve quality and productivity  cut costs  and increase throughput 
while all key departments in the laboratory services and product sales segments have now been through initial lean processes  as an organization we recognize that lean is an ongoing philosophy  not a project to be finished 
lean is a highly disciplined process that helps us focus on reducing waste and eliminating unnecessary steps in our business processes 
our six sigma initiatives address quality and variability in processes 
our lean and six sigma processes have resulted in cost savings which have helped to improve our gross margins over the past few years 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies outlined below as critical to understanding our business and results of operations 
the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the company s business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item note that the preparation of this annual report on form k requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies are as follows accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customers current creditworthiness  as determined by management s review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have generally been within our historical expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that have occurred in the past 
our consolidated trade accounts receivable balance at december  was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
revenue recognition some of our laboratory services revenues for certain types of tests are billed to third party payers including insurance companies  state medicaid and medicare agencies 
these payers pay for such services at established amounts  which are typically lower than gross amounts billed by us 
however  the tests are sometimes billed directly to patients or other parties and paid at the gross amount billed for these tests 
in addition  billings for the tests are occasionally re billed to alternative payers in situations where incorrect billing information was submitted to us by the customer 
historically  the amounts of such incorrect billings have not been material 
we estimate a discount on the billings for these tests and recognize revenues and related accounts receivable at a net amount  after discount  in order to state revenues and accounts receivable at the amount expected to be paid 
while we believe that estimated discounts and the related net revenues and net accounts receivable from these testing services are materially correct  there can be differences in amounts ultimately paid compared to estimated amounts 
these differences are recorded upon payment and may affect previously recorded amounts 
we consider contracted rates with payers and historical discounts when estimating future discounts on a monthly basis 
product sales are recognized according to the terms of delivery  net of estimated allowances for returns 
off site supplies inventory off site supplies represent collection kits and forms located at collection sites throughout the united states used by laboratory services customers to submit specimens for testing services 
these inventories are recorded at the lower of historical cost or market 
at december   off site inventory was million 
the process for valuing off site inventory involves making significant assumptions regarding the average time that a collection site uses the inventory  as well as the amount of inventory expected to be scrapped 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances 
we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year 
no impairments were indicated as a result of our annual impairment reviews for goodwill and other intangible assets in  or in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  projections regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors are made to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and tax planning strategies  and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we increase or decrease the valuation allowance in a period  we must include an expense or benefit within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets primarily consist of certain net operating losses nols carried forward 
at december   we had a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of approximately  which represents the portion of certain state nol carryforwards that will more likely than not expire unused in future years 
the valuation allowance is based on management s estimate of future taxable income and the period over which nols will be recoverable 
in the future  subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of these deferred tax assets could cause the provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although our cash payments would remain unaffected until the benefit of the nols is completely utilized or expires unused 
results of operations in evaluating our financial performance  our management has primarily focused on three objectives maximizing operating income  increasing our cash flows and strengthening our balance sheet 
the first of these objectives is discussed in this section 
the other two are addressed under liquidity and capital resources 
to maximize our operating income  we have sought revenue growth  improved gross margins and reduced selling  general and administrative sg a expense as a percentage of revenues 
as discussed below  during we made positive strides on all three fronts 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues year ended december year over year of revenues of revenues change change revenues laboratory services product sales our laboratory services segment includes revenues from workplace drugs of abuse testing and revenues from specialty laboratory services 
our revenues from workplace drugs of abuse testing grew due to an increase in sample volume and stable pricing for our testing services 
our sample volume and revenue from new account activity was strong during the year 
revenues from our existing clients were also up slightly from the prior year period 
pricing for our workplace drugs of abuse testing services tends to be stable overall  however  the average price per testing specimen can vary slightly from quarter to quarter 
test price can vary by client based on the percentage of samples that test positive for drugs of abuse and the average number of samples per shipment 
revenues from our specialty laboratory services increased to million due to strong growth in testing for our clinical trial services business and a higher average revenue per test 
while we continue to add new clients in clinical trial services  we are also experiencing significant repeat business from existing clients 
however  revenues from these services can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the project nature  size  and the actual timing of clinical trials 
in the product sales segment  sales of poct products  which consist of the profile ii  profile ii er  profile ii a  profile iii  verdict ii and sure screen on site test kits and other ancillary products for the detection of abused substances  increased to million in this growth primarily reflected strong sales of profile ii er  sure screen  and profile iii devices 
overall  pricing for our poct devices was stable year over year 
we will also be marketing our medtoxscan reader for use with our profile ii er device in the hospital market 
we shipped approximately units of medtoxscan to customers beginning late in the third quarter  which is down from our original expectation  due to start up manufacturing issues that have since been resolved 
additionally  in the product sales segment  sales of contract manufacturing services and associated products increased to million in sales of contract manufacturing services were impacted due to the timing of the placement of orders from our two existing clients for these services  as well as an increase in order levels 
gross profit year ended december year over year of revenues of revenues change change cost of revenues cost of services cost of sales cost of services as a percentage of laboratory services revenues cost of sales as a percentage of product sales revenues consolidated gross margin increased to of revenues in  compared to of revenues in the increase was driven by improvement in both laboratory services and product sales gross margins 
laboratory services gross margin was in  up from in the margin improvement was primarily attributable to increased revenues from additional testing volume through our existing infrastructure  as well as an increase in higher margin testing relating to clinical trials 
gross margin from product sales was in  up from in in the first half of  margins were impacted by costs associated with the transition to the new improved product format for our profile ii product line 
operating expenses year ended december year over year of revenues of revenues change change operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of revenues in  compared to million  or in the lower percentage reflects the increase in revenue on marginally higher year over year expenses 
the increase in spending was primarily associated with higher performance based compensation  such as executive deferred compensation expense  based on our financial performance  as well as increased spending in information technology 
other expense other income and expense consists primarily of interest expense and the net expenses associated with our building rental activities 
these expenses were million in  a decrease of compared to the decline was primarily due to lower interest expense  reflecting a reduction in average debt levels  partially offset by reduced net operating results from our building rental activities 
income taxes in  we recorded million in income tax expense  or an effective rate of  compared to an effective rate of in the lower rate in was caused primarily by a million reduction in our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
the reduction in the valuation allowance was based on the available evidence  including our recent historical performance and projected future results 
the reduction in income tax expense from the valuation allowance change was partially offset by a charge of million related to a north carolina department of revenue examination of medtox diagnostics  inc at december   we had a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of approximately  which represents the portion of certain state nol carryforwards that will more likely than not expire unused in future years 
should operating results in and future years differ from expectations  the valuation allowance against the nol carryforwards and the related deferred tax asset may require adjustment in future periods 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues year ended december year over year of revenues of revenues change change revenues laboratory services product sales in our laboratory services segment  our revenues from workplace drugs of abuse testing grew due to an increase in sample volume  partially offset by a slight decrease in the average price per testing specimen 
our increased sample volume was from both new and existing customers across a broad customer base and resulted from the execution of our business strategy 
revenues from our specialty laboratory services increased to million due to strong growth in testing for our clinical trial services 
in the product sales segment  sales of poct products  which consisted of the profile ii  profile ii er  profile ii a  profile iii  verdict ii and sure screen on site test kits and other ancillary products for the detection of abused substances  increased to million in this growth reflected strong sales of profile ii products and solid gains later in the year within the government and rehabilitation markets as our new lower detection poct device sure screen began to have a positive impact on sales in those markets 
overall  pricing for our poct devices was stable year over year 
sales of contract manufacturing services and associated products decreased to million in and were impacted by the timing of the placement of orders from our two existing clients for these services 
gross profit year ended december year over year of revenues of revenues change change cost of revenues cost of services cost of sales cost of services as a percentage of laboratory services revenues cost of sales as a percentage of product sales revenues consolidated gross margin increased to of revenues in  compared to of revenues in laboratory services gross margin was in  up from in the margin improvement was attributable to increased revenues from additional testing volume through our existing infrastructure 
gross margin from product sales declined to in  down from in  largely due to the impact of costs associated with the transition to an enhanced product format for our profile ii product line during the first half of the enhanced product began shipping late in the first quarter of operating expenses year ended december year over year of revenues of revenues change change operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development operating expenses increased in  but as a percentage of revenues were down slightly 
the increase reflected a continued increased investment in sales and marketing  information technology and research and development activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of revenues in  compared to million  or in the lower percentage reflects the increase in revenue on marginally higher year over year expenses 
the increase in spending was primarily associated with higher performance based compensation such as executive deferred compensation expense and sales commissions based on our financial performance  as well as increased spending in information technology 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million in  primarily due to continued spending for significant development projects in our product sales segment 
during  we completed enhancements to our profile ii  profile ii a  and profile ii er products that shorten run times  darken line intensity  improve readability and extend the positive result hold time 
we received fda k clearance for sure screen 
we also made substantial progress on development of an electronic reader medtoxscan expected to be utilized with our devices in the hospital laboratory and emergency room markets 
other expense other income and expense consists primarily of interest expense and the net expenses associated with our building rental activities 
these expenses were million in  a decrease of compared to the slight decline was primarily due to lower interest expense  reflecting a reduction in average debt levels  partially offset by reduced net operating results from our building rental activities 
income taxes in  we recorded million in income tax expense  or an effective rate of  compared to an effective rate of in the lower rate in was caused primarily by a million reduction in our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
the reduction in the valuation allowance was based on the available evidence  including our recent historical performance and projected future results 
at december   we had a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of approximately  the reduction in income tax expense from the valuation allowance change was partially offset by a charge of million related to a north carolina department of revenue examination of medtox diagnostics  inc liquidity and capital resources our working capital requirements have been funded primarily by various combinations of profitable operations  cash received from debt financing  and the sale of equity securities 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december  and net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
this increase was primarily due to an improvement in our operating results with no corresponding cash payment of income taxes 
this increase was partially offset by a smaller increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased million in compared to million in the increase in was primarily due to the timing of scheduled payments 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in over was primarily due to an improvement in operating results as well as an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities  consisting primarily of capital expenditures  was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
these expenditures consisted of equipment purchased and costs incurred to continue to improve efficiencies and reduce operating costs within our laboratory services and product sales businesses 
we expect equipment and capital improvement expenditures to be between million and million in  with increased investment in instrumentation and facility improvements in support of our growing clinical trials and workplace drugs of abuse business 
such expenditures are expected to be funded through cash provided by operating activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to the refinancing of a portion of our mortgage loan in march see below 
in addition  in  we received proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of warrants to acquire  common shares issued in connection with our private placements in july and august in  the board of directors authorized up to million for the repurchase of shares of the company s common stock through open market or privately negotiated transactions at times and in such amounts as management deemed appropriate 
under this program  we repurchased  shares  at a cost of million  which are being held in treasury 
in  we repurchased  shares of our common stock in the open market at a cost of million for the long term incentive plan 
in  we repurchased  shares of our common stock in the open market and  shares of our common stock from an officer of our company for a combined total cost of  the acquired stock was contributed to our long term incentive plan 
on march   we entered into a term note the note with the wells fargo bank  national association the bank to refinance  on march   a portion of the outstanding balance of million on our mortgage loan with principal life insurance company principal 
we financed the march purchase of the building complex  where our laboratory services segment and other commercial tenants are located  with the mortgage loan from principal 
the mortgage loan had a term of ten years and was being repaid based on a year amortization schedule at a fixed interest rate of for the first five years 
in accordance with the provisions of the mortgage loan  principal had the option to adjust the interest rate  effective march   or to call the loan due on march  we elected not to accept the interest rate adjustment and refinanced million with the bank over a five year term in monthly installments of approximately  plus interest  commencing may  interest is calculated at either i a variable rate of below the prime rate or ii a fixed rate of above libor in effect on the first day of the applicable fixed rate term 
we paid the remaining outstanding mortgage loan balance of approximately million using approximately million of our line of credit and million of cash 
at december   we had an outstanding balance of million on our note and no outstanding balance on our line of credit 
we are party to a credit security agreement the wells fargo credit agreement with the bank 
the wells fargo credit agreement  as amended  consists of i a revolving line of credit line of credit  payable on demand  of up to million bearing interest at either a fluctuating rate of below the bank s prime rate or at a fixed rate of above libor  as defined and calculated by the bank  in effect on the first day of the applicable fixed rate term  and ii a note or notes aggregating up to million loan limit for the purchase of capital equipment bearing interest at either a rate of below the bank s prime rate or at a fixed rate for a period of one  two  three  or four years at a rate of in excess of the then current yield on us treasury securities  adjusted to a constant maturity equal to such fixed rate period 
subject to certain conditions  the wells fargo credit agreement also provides for the issuance of letters of credit which  if drawn upon  would be deemed advances under the line of credit 
we are required to pay a fee equal to per annum on the average daily unused amount of the line of credit 
we have granted the bank a first priority security interest in all of the company s accounts receivable  other rights to payment  general intangibles  inventory  and equipment to secure all indebtedness of the company to the bank 
extensions of credit under the wells fargo credit agreement are subject to certain conditions 
the wells fargo agreement also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants  including maintaining  on a consolidated basis a current ratio not less than to at any time  with current ratio defined as total current assets divided by total current liabilities 
tangible net worth not less than  at any time  with tangible net worth defined as the aggregate of total stockholders equity plus subordinated debt less any intangible assets 
total liabilities divided by tangible net worth not greater than to at any time  with total liabilities defined as the aggregate of current liabilities and non current liabilities less subordinated debt  and with tangible net worth as defined above 
a debt service coverage ratio not less than to as of each fiscal quarter end  determined on a rolling four quarter basis  with debt service coverage ratio defined as the aggregate of net income before non cash tax expense plus depreciation expense and amortization expense  divided by the aggregate of the current maturity of long term debt for the previous four fiscal quarters plus current capital lease obligations for the previous four fiscal quarters 
we are relying on expected positive cash flow from operations and our line of credit to fund our future working capital and asset purchases 
at december   we had total borrowing capacity of million on our line of credit 
we did not have an outstanding balance on the line of credit at december  in the short term  we believe that the aforementioned resources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations through while there can be no assurance that the available capital will be sufficient to fund our future operations beyond  we believe that future profitable operations  as well as access to additional capital through debt or equity financings  will be the primary means for funding our operations for the long term 
we continue to follow a plan which includes i aggressively monitoring and controlling costs  ii increasing revenue from sales of the our existing products and services iii developing new products and services  as well as iv selectively pursuing synergistic acquisitions to increase our critical mass 
however  there can be no assurance that costs can be controlled  revenues can be increased  financing may be obtained  acquisitions successfully consummated  or that we will be profitable 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table aggregates all contractual commitments and commercial obligations that affect the company s financial condition and liquidity position at december  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual obligations amounts include interest payments based upon contractual or prevailing interest rates 
off balance sheet transactions we do not maintain any off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
impact of inflation and changing prices the impact of inflation and changing prices has been primarily limited to salary  laboratory and operating supplies and rent increases and has historically not been material to our operations 
in the future  we may not be able to increase the prices of laboratory testing by an amount sufficient to cover the cost of inflation  although we are responding to these concerns by offering the highest quality products and services  delivered rapidly  priced competitively and supported by value added services for customers 
seasonality we believe that the laboratory testing business is subject to seasonal fluctuations in pre employment screening 
these seasonal fluctuations include reduced volume in the year end holiday periods  and other major holidays 
in addition  inclement weather may have a negative impact on volume thereby reducing net revenues and cash flow 
impact of new accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosure requirements regarding fair value measurement 
where applicable  sfas no 
simplifies and codifies fair value related guidance previously issued within generally accepted accounting principles 
although  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements  its application may  for some entities  change current practice 
sfas no 
is effective for the company as of january  we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
in september  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  which provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after november  early application is encouraged  but not required 
we adopted sab no 
for our fiscal year ending december  the adoption of this bulletin did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
this interpretation requires that we recognize in our financial statements  the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin are effective for us as of january  we are in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of fin and expect there will be no cumulative effect of applying the provisions as of the beginning of in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

sfas no 
permits entities to choose  at specified election dates  to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we have not yet evaluated the impact of adopting sfas no 
on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in interest rates or currency exchange rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates 
during   and  we did not have sales denominated in foreign currencies nor did we have any subsidiaries located in foreign countries 
as such  we are not exposed to market risk associated with currency exchange rates and prices 
at december   we had a term note with wells fargo bank bearing interest at a variable rate of below the prime rate 
at december   we had approximately million in long term debt outstanding under the wells fargo credit agreement 
the debt under the wells fargo credit agreement had variable interest rates 
we have cash flow exposure on our committed and uncommitted line of credit and long term debt with wells fargo bank due to its variable prime rate pricing 
at december   a change in the prime rate would increase or decrease interest expense or cash flows by less than million 
at december   we had a million mortgage loan payable to principal at a fixed annual rate of 
in accordance with the provisions of the loan  principal had the option to adjust the interest rate  effective march   or to call the loan due on march  we elected not to accept the interest rate adjustment and repaid the outstanding balance of million on march  at december   we had capital leases totaling  at various fixed rates 
these fixed rate financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will increase or decrease in value if market interest rates change 
changes in market interest rates would not impact our cash obligations under these fixed rate obligations 
we do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments or hedging transactions for trading or speculative purposes
