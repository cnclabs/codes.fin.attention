item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements the information set forth in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the exchange act  and is subject to the safe harbor created by those sections 
factors that realistically could cause results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements are set forth in this section and earlier in this report under item a 
risk factors  beginning on page the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto 
overview and executive summary we design  develop  manufacture  market and service hpc systems  commonly known as supercomputers 
our supercomputer systems provide capability  capacity and sustained performance far beyond typical server based computer systems and address challenging scientific and engineering computing problems 
we believe we are well positioned to meet the hpc market s demanding needs by providing superior supercomputer systems with performance and cost advantages when sustained performance on challenging applications and total cost of ownership are taken into account 
we differentiate ourselves from our competitors primarily by concentrating our research and development efforts on the processing  interconnect and software capabilities that enable our systems to scale that is  to continue to increase performance as our systems grow in size 
purpose built for the supercomputer market  our systems balance highly capable processors  highly scalable software and very high speed interconnect and communications capabilities 
in  our management changed significantly with a new chief executive officer and new leaders in technology  engineering  finance  marketing  operations and customer support 
under our new management team  we have expanded our worldwide customer base  refined our product roadmap  established a lower operating cost model and sharpened our focus on execution to meet customer expectations and improve our financial operating results 
in early we announced our adaptive supercomputing vision to expand the concept of hybrid computing to a fully integrated view of both hardware and software supporting multiple processing technologies within a single  highly scalable system 
we believe that our november million award from the darpa under its hpcs program validates our adaptive supercomputing vision 
this award will co fund our cascade development project to implement this vision 
summary of results revenue increased by million or in from due to a million increase in product revenue  principally from cray xt system sales  and a million increase in service revenue 

table of contents loss from operations improved to a loss of million in from a loss of million in the improvement was primarily due to a million increase in gross margin and a million reduction in operating expenses driven by lower research and development and restructuring  severance and impairment costs 
net cash provided by operations in was million compared to a use of cash of million in cash balances  including restricted cash balances  increased million during and we did not borrow amounts under our line of credit agreements 
the increase in cash balances principally resulted from our public stock offering in december and cash from operations 
market overview and challenges the most significant trend in the high performance computing market is the continuing expansion and acceptance of low bandwidth and cluster systems using processors manufactured by intel  amd  ibm and others with commercially available commodity networking and other components throughout the high performance computing market  especially in capacity computing situations 
these systems may offer higher theoretical peak performance for equivalent cost  and vendors of such systems often put pricing pressure on us in competitive procurements  even at times in capability market procurements 
to compete against these systems in the longer term  we need to incorporate greater performance differentiation across our products 
we believe we will have such differentiation through our new vector based product being developed in our blackwidow project and our new multithreaded cray xmt system 
these products  which focus initially on a narrower market than our commodity processor products  are expected to be available in late one of our challenges is to broaden the markets for these products 
we must add greater performance differentiation to our high bandwidth massively parallel commodity processor based products  such as the cray xt and successor systems  while balancing the business strategy trade offs between using commodity parts  which are available to our competitors  and proprietary components  which are both expensive and time consuming to develop 
our strategy our goal is to become the leading provider of supercomputers in the markets that we target 
key elements of our strategy include gain share in our core hpc market 
we intend to leverage our strong product portfolio  product roadmap and brand recognition in the high end of the hpc market to gain market share 
we believe that most of our competitors are primarily focused on the lower end of the hpc market where low bandwidth cluster systems dominate 
we plan to remain focused on the capability and enterprise segments of the hpc market 
maintain focus on execution and profitability 
we are committed to achieving sustained profitability on an annual basis 
we intend to continue to refine our product roadmap  converge our technologies and development processes  improve our ability to deliver high quality products on time and on budget and continue our commitment to financial discipline 
extend technology leadership 
we are an innovation driven company in a technology driven market 
we plan to maintain a technology leadership position by investing in research and development and partnering with key customers with interests aligned strongly with ours 
we will rely in part on government funding for our research and development efforts 
we intend to execute on our product roadmap and implement our adaptive supercomputing vision to realize the concept of supporting multiple processing technologies within a single  highly scalable linux based system 
expand total addressable market 
over time  we intend to leverage our technologies  customer base and cray brand in new segments and expand our addressable market 
we believe we have the opportunity to compete in a broader portion of the hpc market as well as selective markets outside of hpc 

table of contents key performance indicators our management monitors and analyzes several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance  including revenue 
product revenue generally constitutes the major portion of our revenue in any reporting period  and for the reasons discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k is subject to significant variability from period to period 
in the short term  we closely review the status of product shipments  installations and acceptances in order to forecast revenue and cash receipts  longer term  we monitor the status of the pipeline of product sales opportunities and product development cycles 
revenue growth is the best indicator of whether we are achieving our objective of increased market share in the markets we address 
our new products scheduled for and our longer term adaptive supercomputing vision are efforts to increase product revenue 
product revenue varies significantly from quarter to quarter 
service revenue is more constant in the short run and assists  in part  to offset the impact that the variability in product revenue has on total revenue 
gross margins 
our overall product margins in were 
after adjusting for the effect of our low margin red storm and darpa phase ii development projects  which were included as product revenue  overall product margins were 
to be successful  we need to increase product gross margins  which we believe is best achieved through increased product differentiation 
we also monitor service margins and have been proactive in reducing service costs where possible 
our mid term objective is to achieve overall margins  as a percentage of revenue  from to or better 
recent increases in gross margins have led to improved operational results 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses are driven largely by headcount  contracted research and development services and the level of co funded research and development 
we had two major headcount reductions in as part of our ongoing efforts to control operating expenses  we monitor headcount levels in specific geographic and operational areas 
during we received increased levels of co funding for our research and development projects 
our november darpa phase iii award is in line with our long term development path 
this award likely will result in some increase in gross and net research and development expenditures by us in future periods due to the size of the overall program and the cost sharing requirement on our part 
our overall operating expenses significantly decreased in compared to  especially in research and development 
our operating expenses  excluding cost of revenue  as a percent of revenue were  compared to in our mid term objective is for operating expenses  as a percentage of revenue  to be in the range of to 
meeting this objective is dependent on our ability to increase revenue in the future 
liquidity and cash flows 
due to the variability in product revenue  our cash position also varies from quarter to quarter and within a quarter 
we closely monitor our expected cash levels  particularly in light of potential increased inventory purchases for large system installations and the risk of delays in product shipments and acceptances and  longer term  in product development 
our december common stock offering is consistent with our goal to build our cash position to provide additional working capital and to improve our operational and strategic flexibility while at the same time lowering the business risk to shareholders 
sustained profitability over annual periods is our primary objective  which should improve our cash position and shareholder value 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report on form k are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
in preparing our financial statements in accordance with us gaap  there are certain accounting policies that are particularly important 
these include revenue recognition  inventory valuation  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  accounting for loss contracts and stock based compensation 
we believe these accounting policies and others set forth in note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 
in some cases  these policies represent required accounting 
in other cases  they may represent a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation 

table of contents additionally  we consider certain judgments and estimates to be significant  including those relating to the fair value determination used in revenue recognition  percentage of completion accounting on the red storm contract  estimates of proportional performance on co funded engineering contracts  determination of inventory at the lower of cost or market  useful lives for depreciation and amortization  determination of future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill and long lived assets  determination of the fair value of stock options and assessments of fair value  estimation of restructuring costs  calculation of deferred income tax assets  potential income tax assessments and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
our management has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been shipped or the services have been provided to our customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable  no significant unfulfilled obligations exist and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record revenue in our statements of operations net of any sales  use  value added or certain excise taxes imposed by governmental authorities on specific sales transactions 
in addition to the aforementioned general policy  the following are the specific revenue recognition policies for each major category of revenue and for multiple element arrangements 
products 
we recognize revenue from our product lines as follows cray x xe and cray xt xt product lines 
we recognize revenue from product sales upon customer acceptance of the system  when we have no significant unfulfilled obligations stipulated by the contract that affect the customer s final acceptance  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
a customer signed notice of acceptance or similar document is required from the customer prior to revenue recognition 
cray xd product line 
we recognize revenue from product sales of cray xd systems upon shipment to  or delivery to  the customer  depending upon contract terms  when we have no significant unfulfilled obligations stipulated by the contract  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
if there is a contractual requirement for customer acceptance  revenue is recognized upon receipt of the notice of acceptance and when we have no unfulfilled obligations 
revenue from contracts that require us to design  develop  manufacture or modify complex information technology systems to a customer s specifications is recognized using the percentage of completion method for long term development projects under american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
percentage of completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs 
total estimated costs are based on several factors  including estimated labor hours to complete certain tasks and the estimated cost of purchased components or services 
estimates may need to be adjusted from quarter to quarter  which would impact revenue and margins on a cumulative basis 
to the extent the estimate of total costs to complete the contract indicates a loss  such amount is recognized in full in the period that the determination is made 
services 
maintenance services are provided under separate maintenance contracts with our customers 
these contracts generally provide for maintenance services for one year  although some are for multi year periods  often with prepayments for the term of the contract 
we consider the maintenance period to commence upon installation and acceptance of the product  which may include a warranty period 
we allocate a portion of the sales price to maintenance service revenue based on estimates of fair value 
revenue for the maintenance of computers is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract 
maintenance contracts that are paid in advance are 
table of contents recorded as deferred revenue 
we consider fiscal funding clauses as contingencies for the recognition of revenue until the funding is virtually assured 
revenue from cray technical services is recognized as the services are rendered 
multiple element arrangements 
we commonly enter into transactions that include multiple element arrangements  which may include any combination of hardware  maintenance and other services 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  when some elements are delivered prior to others in an arrangement and all of the following criteria are met  revenue for the delivered element is recognized upon delivery and acceptance of such item the element could be sold separately  the fair value of the undelivered element is established  and in cases with any general right of return  our performance with respect to any undelivered element is within our control and probable 
if all of the criteria are not met  revenue is deferred until delivery of the last element as the elements would not be considered a separate unit of accounting and revenue would be recognized as described above under our product line or service revenue recognition policies 
we consider the maintenance period to commence upon installation and acceptance of the product  which may include a warranty period and accordingly allocate a portion of the sales price as a separate deliverable which is recognized as service revenue over the entire service period 
inventory valuation we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly evaluate the technological usefulness and anticipated future demand of our inventory components 
due to rapid changes in technology and the increasing demands of our customers  we are continually developing new products 
additionally  during periods of product or inventory component upgrades or transitions  we may acquire significant quantities of inventory to support estimated current and future production and service requirements 
for example  we have placed a last time buy order on a key component for our cray xt and cray xmt systems and blackwidow project 
as a result  it is possible that older inventory items we have purchased may become obsolete  be sold below cost or be deemed in excess of quantities required for production or service requirements 
when we determine it is not likely we will recover the cost of inventory items through future sales  we write down the related inventory to our estimate of its market value 
we are nearing the end of the life cycle for the cray xt system and have made certain estimates of the future demand for this product 
these estimates are subject to risk in the near term and could require a write down of inventory if the actual demand is lower than currently estimated 
during  we wrote off approximately million of cray xt inventory deemed in excess of current demand 
because the products we sell have high average sales prices and competitive product lives of generally one to two years  and because a high number of our prospective customers receive funding from us or foreign governments  it is difficult to estimate future sales of our products and the timing of such sales 
it also is difficult to determine whether the cost of our inventories will ultimately be recovered through future sales 
while we believe our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and that our estimates and assumptions to determine any adjustments to the cost of our inventories are reasonable  our estimates may prove to be inaccurate 
we have sold inventory previously reduced in part or in whole to zero  and we may have future sales of previously written down inventory 
we also may have additional expense to write down inventory to its estimated market value 
adjustments to these estimates in the future may materially impact our operating results 
goodwill and other intangible assets approximately of our total assets as of december  consisted of goodwill resulting from our acquisition of the cray research business unit assets from sgi in and our acquisition of octigabay in april we no longer amortize goodwill associated with these acquisitions  but we are required to conduct periodic analyses of the recorded amount of goodwill in comparison to its estimated fair value 
we currently have one operating segment and reporting unit 
as such  we evaluate any potential goodwill impairment by comparing our 
table of contents net assets against the market value of our outstanding shares of common stock 
we performed an annual impairment test effective january   and determined that our recorded goodwill was not impaired 
the analysis of whether the fair value of recorded goodwill is impaired and the number and nature of our reporting units involves a substantial amount of judgment 
future charges related to the amounts recorded for goodwill could be material depending on future developments and changes in technology and our business 
in connection with our acquisition of octigabay  we assigned million of value to core technology 
in december we announced plans to further integrate our technology platforms  and combine the cray xd and the cray xt products into a unified product offering 
we determined that the core technology asset was impaired and recorded a charge of million charge in to restructuring  severance and impairment in the consolidated statements of operations 
in connection with this charge  we reversed the remaining deferred tax liability of million that was established in the purchase accounting as amortization of this intangible asset was not deductible for income tax purposes 
accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for income taxes fas  a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is provided when we estimate that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized through future operations 
this assessment is based upon consideration of available positive and negative evidence  which includes  among other things  our most recent results of operations and expected future profitability 
we consider our actual historical results to have stronger weight than other more subjective indicators when considering whether to establish or reduce a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
the provision for or benefit from income taxes represents taxes payable or receivable for the current period plus the net change in deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowance amounts during the period 
in  we reversed million of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  principally us loss carryforwards  based primarily upon our consideration of our most recent profitable operating performance as well as our reasonably expected future performance 
based upon our judgment of the positive and negative evidence  we concluded that we would more likely than not be able to utilize most of our net deferred tax asset 
in late  we established a valuation allowance and recorded an income tax expense of million based on our losses from operations in and based on our revised projections indicating continued challenging financial results 
based upon our most recent negative operating results  which we consider as a strong indicator of our future ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  we established a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets  principally us loss carryforwards  created during in accordance with fas as of december   we had approximately million of deferred tax assets  against which we provided a million valuation allowance 
the net deferred tax assets were generated in foreign jurisdictions where we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize these assets through future operations 
for the years ended december   and we recognized income tax expense of  and income tax benefit of million  respectively 
income tax expense in all periods was related to taxes in foreign and certain state and local jurisdictions 
accounting for loss contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  certain production contracts are accounted for using the percentage of completion accounting method 
we recognize revenue based on a measurement of completion comparing the ratio of costs incurred to date with total estimated costs multiplied by the contract value 
inherent in these estimates are uncertainties about the total cost to complete the project 
if the estimate to complete results in a loss on the contract  we will record the amount of the estimated loss in the period the determination is made 
on a regular basis  we update our estimates of total costs 
changes to the estimate may result in a charge or benefit to operations 
as of december   our estimate of loss on the red storm contract was consistent with our 
table of contents estimate of such loss as of december   which was a cumulative loss of million  all of which was recorded in prior periods 
as of december  and  the red storm loss contract accrual balance was  and million  respectively  and is included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
research and development expenses research and development costs include costs incurred in the development and production of our hardware and software  costs incurred to enhance and support existing software features and expenses related to future product development 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred  and may be offset by co funding from the us government 
amounts to be received under co funding arrangements with the us government are based on either contractual milestones or costs incurred 
these co funding milestone payments are recognized as an offset to research and development expenses as performance is estimated to be completed and is measured as milestone achievements or as costs are incurred 
we do not record a receivable from the us government prior to completing the requirements necessary to bill for a milestone or cost reimbursement 
funding from the us government is subject to certain budget restrictions and as such  there may be periods in which research and development costs are expensed as incurred for which no reimbursement is recorded  as milestones have not been completed or the us government has not funded an agreement 
we classify amounts to be received from funded research and development projects as either revenue or a reduction to research and development expense  based on the specific facts and circumstances of the contractual arrangement  considering total costs expected to be incurred compared to total expected funding and the nature of the research and development contractual arrangement 
in the event that a particular arrangement is determined to represent revenue  the corresponding research and development costs are classified as cost of revenue 
share based compensation on january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fas r 
prior to january   we accounted for share based payments under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations  as permitted by fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas 
in accordance with apb  no compensation cost was required to be recognized for options granted that had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
certain of the stock options granted in connection with the octigabay acquisition in had exercise prices below the fair market value of our common stock at the grant date and accordingly we have recorded compensation expense over the vesting period based on the intrinsic value method 
we adopted fas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation cost recognized for the year ended december   includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested  as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of fas  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r 
the financial results for the prior periods have not been restated 
estimates of fair value of stock options are based upon the black scholes option pricing model 
we utilize assumptions related to stock price volatility  stock option term and forfeiture rates that are based upon both historical factors as well as management s judgment 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect 
table of contents the adoption of fin to be significant but it will require us to provide additional disclosures about tax uncertainties 
in september  the fasb issued fas no 
 fair value measurements fas 
fas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements but does not require any new fair value measurements 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the adoption of fas to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued fas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans fas 
fas requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
we adopted fas as of december   and this adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position 
in february  the fasb issued fas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  fas 
fas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we have not yet determined the impact of adopting fas on our financial statements 
results of operations revenue and gross margins our product and service revenue for the indicated years ended december were in thousands  except for percentages year ended december  product revenue less cost of product revenue product gross margin product gross margin percentage service revenue less cost of service revenue service gross margin service gross margin percentage total revenue less total cost of revenue total gross margin total gross margin percentage product revenue product revenue in increased million  or  over due to increased sales of cray xt systems which offset sales decreases of cray xe and cray xd systems 
revenue from the darpa phase ii and red storm development projects totaled million in compared to million in 
table of contents the increase in product revenue over levels was due to increased sales of all three of our principal products  the cray xe  the cray xt and the cray xd systems 
in we recorded approximately million in product revenue from the darpa phase ii and red storm development projects which was a reduction of million compared to due to reduced expenditures and associated revenue  in particular on the red storm development project 
for the full year  we expect strong product sales growth  offset in part by a nearly million reduction in low margin development related project revenue 
the revenue level is dependent on the success of the cray xt system and the timing and success of the cray xmt and blackwidow systems 
the cray xt system is currently available with an upgrade to quad core processors and system software expected to be available in the second half of while the cray xmt and blackwidow systems are not expected to reach general availability until late service revenue service revenue for increased million  or  over  due to a growth in maintenance revenue from new contracts and revenue from cray technical services 
service revenue in decreased slightly from due to lower revenue on maintenance contracts as older systems were withdrawn from service 
revenue from cray technical services in increased by million from million in due principally to a service contract to refurbish certain components for a customer 
while we expect our maintenance service revenue to stabilize over the next year  we may have periodic revenue and margin declines as our older  higher margin service contracts end 
our newer products will likely require less hardware maintenance and therefore generate less maintenance revenue than our historic vector systems 
overall service revenue may decline in due to the end of a cray technical services refurbishment contract in product gross margin product gross margin improved percentage points for compared to this improvement in product gross margin was due to increased gross margins across all product lines  including lower charges for excess and obsolete inventory and no amortization of core technology intangible assets that were written off during the fourth quarter of additionally  gross margins for were negatively impacted by a million loss on the red storm project 
product gross margin in  although improved compared to  was impacted by several factors  including higher sales of the lower margin cray xd product  a million charge for a change in the estimate to complete the red storm project due principally to the addition of hardware deliverables to settle contract and performance issues  and million of charges for inventory write downs  which included scrap and obsolete inventory 
the red storm and darpa phases i and ii research and development costs  totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively  are reflected on our financial statements as cost of product revenue and the related reimbursements are recorded in our financial statements as product revenue 
excluding these low margin development projects  product gross margin would have been  and  respectively 
revenue for  and included  million and  respectively  from the sale of obsolete inventory recorded at a zero cost basis 
in  this amount consisted mainly of the sale of a refurbished cray te supercomputer  one of our legacy systems 
with minimal low margin  development related product revenue expected in and the expected benefit of three new product introductions  overall product gross margins should increase in as compared to 
table of contents service gross margin service gross margin improved percentage points in compared to due to the increases in maintenance and cray technical services revenue while increasing costs at a lower rate 
in both and  our service gross margin was favorably impacted by high margin cray technical services contracts  service cost reductions implemented in the fourth quarter of and the second half of both and  and the lower amortization expense of legacy spare parts inventory  offset in in part by increased costs incurred to achieve customer acceptances of large cray xt systems 
service gross margin percentage for is expected to decrease somewhat from levels as revenue from certain high margin cray technical services contracts is expected to decrease  and we expect to incur additional costs associated with expanding our cray technical services offerings 
operating expenses research and development research and development expenses for the indicated years ended december were as follows in thousands december  gross research and development expenses less amounts included in cost of product revenue less reimbursed research and development excludes amounts in revenue net research and development expenses percentage of total revenue gross research and development expenses in the table above reflect all research and development expenditures  including expenses related to our research and development activities on the red storm and darpa phases i  ii and iii projects 
research and development expenses on the red storm and darpa phases i and ii projects are reflected in our statements of operations as cost of product revenue  and government co funding on our other projects  including darpa phase iii  is recorded in our statements of operations as reimbursed research and development 
research and development expenses include personnel expenses  depreciation  allocations for certain overhead expenses  software  prototype materials and outside contracted engineering expenses 
we have received increased government co funding each period 
for  net research and development expenses decreased as compared to due principally to increases in reimbursement for our blackwidow  cray xmt and darpa projects and reduced research and development expenses for the cray xd product line which was offset by a million charge related to an intellectual property license agreement 
in  net research and development expenses decreased as compared to due to increased government funding for our blackwidow project  and the effect of a pay reduction program in the second half of  partially offset by option expense as we accelerated vesting on options issued in connection with the octigabay acquisition at the beginning of the second quarter in we anticipate both gross research and development expenses and the total level of government funding to increase in  with net research and development expenses likely higher than levels due to the cost sharing portion of the darpa phase iii award  with possible further increases in net research and development expenses if the us government ceases co funding on our blackwidow or cray xmt projects earlier than anticipated 
we expect that research and development co funding  including amounts under the darpa phase iii  blackwidow and cray xmt funding agreements  will be recorded as a reduction to research and development expense in  based on contract specific terms 

table of contents other operating expenses our sales and marketing  general and administrative and restructuring  severance and impairment charges for the indicated years ended december were in thousands year ended december  sales and marketing percentage of total revenue general and administrative percentage of total revenue restructuring  severance and impairment percentage of total revenue sales and marketing 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses for compared to was primarily due to a decrease in headcount and related expenses as a result of a personnel reduction that took place in  offset in part by higher commission expense on increased product revenues 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses compared to was due to lower headcount  the pay reduction program in the second half of and lower discretionary spending  offset in part by higher commissions on increased product revenue 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will be higher than levels primarily due to increased sales commissions on higher anticipated product sales 
general and administrative 
the increase in general and administrative costs for over was primarily due to increases in expense for variable pay and retention compensation programs and in non cash  stock based compensation incurred in connection with restricted stock awards and stock option grants  which were partially offset by a general decrease in headcount expenses and lower costs for external audit  sarbanes oxley compliance and legal fees 
the decrease in general and administrative expense in compared to was primarily due to the effects of our reduction in force  as well as the pay reduction program in the second half of  savings from which were offset in part by increased fees for external audit  sarbanes oxley compliance and legal fees 
we expect general and administrative expenses to be similar and potentially lower than expense levels 
restructuring  severance and impairment 
restructuring  severance and impairment charges include costs related to our efforts to reduce our overall cost structure by reducing headcount 
during  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees 
we incurred additional severance charges primarily for the retirement of our former chief executive officer  james rottsolk  in the third quarter of during  we incurred severance and other exit costs related to our actions of million 
in connection with the acquisition of octigabay  we allocated million of the purchase price to a core technology intangible asset  which was associated with the cray xd system 
in connection with the fourth quarter decision to incorporate the cray xd system technology into the cray xt line  as well as limited expected future benefits of the core technology obtained in the acquisition  we evaluated the carrying value of the unamortized balance of the intangible asset of million and determined that the carrying value of the asset was impaired and accordingly recorded a charge for the million in the fourth quarter of the costs primarily represented severance expenses related to the termination of employees in the united states and an additional employees throughout the rest of the world in the second half of in process research and development charge as part of the acquisition of octigabay  we incurred an expense associated with acquired in process research and development of million in the second quarter of 
table of contents other income expense  net for the years ended december   and  we recognized net other expense of million  million and  respectively 
net other expense for the year ended december   was principally the result of foreign exchange losses in connection with a forward foreign exchange contract  while net other expense for the years ended december  and was principally foreign currency losses on the remeasurement of foreign currency balances  principally intercompany balances 
interest income expense  net our interest income and interest expense for the indicated years ended december were in thousands year ended december  interest income interest expense net interest income expense interest income increased in compared to as a result of higher average invested cash balances and higher short term interest rates 
interest expense for both and principally consisted of million of interest on our notes 
additionally  interest expense consisted of million and million  respectively  of non cash amortization of fees capitalized in connection with both our line of credit with wells fargo foothill  inc wff and our long term debt offering costs 
we also recorded  and  respectively  of interest and related fees on our line of credit with wff 
the interest expense for reflects approximately one month of interest on our notes  one month of amortization of the related capitalized issuance costs and interest on our capital leases 
taxes tax expense was  in which reflects estimated current tax expense for local  state and foreign tax jurisdictions 
benefit from income taxes in was million  which consisted of a million benefit for foreign deferred taxes  partially offset by current tax expense for local  state and foreign tax jurisdictions 
we recorded an income tax provision of million in  principally related to the establishment of a million valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  consisting primarily of accumulated net operating losses 
under the criteria set forth in fas  management concluded that it was unlikely that the future benefits of these deferred tax assets would be realized 
there has been no current provision for us federal income taxes for any period presented 
we have income taxes currently payable due to our operations in certain foreign countries  particularly in canada and certain european and asian countries and in certain states 
as of december   we had tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million that will begin to expire in if not utilized 
net income loss net loss was million in  million in and million in the loss included low gross margin on product revenue recognized for our cray x xe installation at the korea meteorological administration  million in inventory write downs and a million charge for an intellectual property license agreement 
the loss included a million charge for additional estimated losses identified during on the red storm development contract and restructuring  severance and impairment charges of million  which includes a million write down for core technology impairment 

table of contents the net loss included significant charges consisting of income tax expense of million  principally related to the establishment of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  a million write off of in process research and development acquired as part of the octigabay acquisition  a million charge to recognize the initial loss estimated on the red storm fixed price contract  an million restructuring charge  and an million write down of inventory 
while there continues to be a wide range of potential outcomes  we believe total revenue of million to million for is the most relevant range 
within this target revenue range  we anticipate operating income of approximately to percent of revenue  including about million of anticipated non cash stock compensation expense 
quarterly results are likely to be quite variable due to the timing of a limited number of large customer contracts 
we believe that year over year changes in net income are not necessarily predictive of our future results 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and accounts receivable totaled million as of december   compared to million as of december   cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash increased by million while accounts receivable decreased by million 
as of december   we had working capital of million compared to million as of december  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to a use of million for the same period in for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was principally the result of non cash depreciation and amortization being greater than our net loss for the year and cash generated from changes in operating assets and liabilities 
for the year ended december   cash used by operating activities was principally the result of our net loss for the period and increases in inventory and accounts receivable  partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue 
for  net operating cash was used primarily by our net operating loss and an increase in inventory  offset in part by increases in deferred revenue and accounts payable and a decrease in accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities was million in net cash provided by investing activities in was million 
in  net cash used in investing activities was million 
during  net cash used in investing activities was principally as a result of an increase in restricted cash  required under the provisions of our new line of credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na for the year ended december   net cash provided by investing activities consisted of the sale of short term investments  partially offset by the purchases of short term investments and equipment as well as a decrease in restricted cash 
in  net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of million of capital expenditures  an million increase in restricted cash and million used for the acquisition of octigabay which consisted of million in cash used in connection with the acquisition netted against million in cash we acquired from octigabay  offset by net sales of  of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in net cash used in financing activities was  in net cash provided by financing activities was million in for the year ended december   cash provided by financing activities includes million from our december common stock offering and million of proceeds from employee exercises of stock options 
for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities consisted primarily of  paid for line of credit issuance costs and  for payments on capital leases  offset by million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the employee stock purchase plan and exercise of stock options 
the net cash provided by financing activities was primarily related to our note offering in which we received net proceeds of million 
in we also received approximately million through stock option and warrant exercises as well as through the issuance of common stock in connection with our employee stock purchase plan 
over the next twelve months  our significant cash requirements will relate to operational expenses  consisting primarily of personnel costs  costs of inventory and spare parts  outside engineering expenses  particularly as we continue development of our cray xt and successor systems and internally fund a portion of the expenses on our 
table of contents cascade project pursuant to the darpa phase iii award  interest expense and acquisition of property and equipment 
our capital budget for property and equipment is approximately million 
in addition  we lease certain equipment and facilities used in our operations under operating or capital leases in the normal course of business 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands amounts committed by year less than contractual obligations total year years years thereafter development agreements capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations we have million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes due in the notes bear interest at an annual rate of  or million per year  and holders of the notes may require us to purchase the notes on december   december  and december  or upon the occurrence of certain events provided in the indenture governing the notes 
additionally  we have a two year revolving line of credit for up to million  which expires in december no amounts were outstanding under this line as of december  as of the same date  we were eligible to borrow million against this line of credit  the borrowing limitation relates to restrictions from our outstanding letters of credit 
in our normal course of operations  we have development arrangements under which we engage outside engineering resources to work on our research and development projects 
for the twelve months ended december   we incurred million for such arrangements 
at any particular time  our cash position is affected by the timing of cash receipts for product sales  maintenance contracts  government co funding for research and development activities and our payments for inventory  resulting in significant fluctuations in our cash balance from quarter to quarter and within a quarter 
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents  operations and credit facility 
even assuming acceptances and payment for large new systems to be sold and the benefit from our and restructurings and other recent cost reduction efforts  our cash flow from operations may be negative for as a whole  largely to support working capital requirements  although a wide range of results is possible 
with the proceeds of our december public offering  and the near term expected cash flow from our darpa phase iii award  we do not anticipate borrowing from our credit line and we expect our cash resources to be adequate for at least the next twelve months 
we have been focusing on expense controls  negotiating sales contracts with advance partial payments where possible  implementing tighter purchasing and manufacturing processes and improving working capital management in order to maintain adequate levels of cash 
additionally  the adequacy of our cash resources is dependent on the amount and timing of government funding as well as our ability to sell our products  particularly the cray xt  blackwidow and cray xmt systems  with adequate margins 
beyond the next twelve months  the adequacy of our cash resources will largely depend on our success in re establishing profitable operations and positive operating cash flows on a sustained basis

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and equity price fluctuations 
interest rate risk we invest our available cash in investment grade debt instruments of corporate issuers and in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies 
we do not have any derivative instruments in our investment portfolio 
we protect and preserve invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities  which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates

table of contents december   we held a portfolio of highly liquid investments  all which were to mature in less than days from the date of initial investment 
foreign currency risk we sell our products primarily in north america  asia and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our products are generally priced in us dollars  and a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
while we commonly sell products with payments in us dollars  our product sales contracts occasionally call for payment in foreign currencies and to the extent we do so  or engage with our foreign subsidiaries in transactions deemed to be short term in nature  we are subject to foreign currency exchange risks 
from time to time  we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated cash receipts on specific sales contracts 
during  we entered into one such contract for million 
all related cash receipts were received in and the hedge was settled 
our foreign maintenance contracts are paid in local currencies and provide a natural hedge against foreign exchange exposure related to our foreign local expenses 
to the extent that we wish to repatriate any of these funds to the united states  however  we are subject to foreign exchange risks 
as of december   a change in foreign exchange rates could impact our annual earnings and cash flows by approximately
