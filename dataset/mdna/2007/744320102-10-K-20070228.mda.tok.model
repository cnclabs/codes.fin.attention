item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the forward looking statements included below the table of contents  risk factors  selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
overview prudential financial has two classes of common stock outstanding 
the common stock  which is publicly traded nyse pru  reflects the performance of the financial services businesses  while the class b stock  which was issued through a private placement and does not trade on any exchange  reflects the performance of the closed block business 
the financial services businesses and the closed block business are discussed below 
financial services businesses our financial services businesses consist of three operating divisions  which together encompass eight segments  and our corporate and other operations 
the insurance division consists of our individual life  individual annuities and group insurance segments 
the investment division consists of our asset management  financial advisory and retirement segments 
the international insurance and investments division consists of our international insurance and international investments segments 
our corporate and other operations include our real estate and relocation services business  as well as corporate items and initiatives that are not allocated to business segments 
corporate and other operations also include businesses that have been or will be divested and businesses that we have placed in wind down status 
in  the results of the individual life and annuities businesses  formerly reported as components of the individual life and annuities segment  are reported as discrete segments for all periods presented 
we attribute financing costs to each segment based on the amount of financing used by each segment  excluding financing costs associated with corporate debt 
the net investment income of each segment includes earnings on the amount of equity that management believes is necessary to support the risks of that segment 
we seek growth internally and through acquisitions  joint ventures or other forms of business combinations or investments 
our principal acquisition focus is in our current business lines  both domestic and international 
closed block business in connection with the demutualization  we ceased offering domestic participating products 
the liabilities for our traditional domestic in force participating products were segregated  together with assets  in a regulatory 
table of contents mechanism referred to as the closed block 
the closed block is designed generally to provide for the reasonable expectations for future policy dividends after demutualization of holders of participating individual life insurance policies and annuities included in the closed block by allocating assets that will be used exclusively for payment of benefits  including policyholder dividends  expenses and taxes with respect to these products 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the closed block 
at the time of demutualization  we determined the amount of closed block assets so that the closed block assets initially had a lower book value than the closed block liabilities 
we expect that the closed block assets will generate sufficient cash flow  together with anticipated revenues from the closed block policies  over the life of the closed block to fund payments of all expenses  taxes  and policyholder benefits to be paid to  and the reasonable dividend expectations of  holders of the closed block policies 
we also segregated for accounting purposes the assets that we need to hold outside the closed block to meet capital requirements related to the closed block policies 
no policies sold after demutualization will be added to the closed block  and its in force business is expected to ultimately decline as we pay policyholder benefits in full 
we also expect the proportion of our business represented by the closed block to decline as we grow other businesses 
concurrently with our demutualization  prudential holdings  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of prudential financial that owns the capital stock of prudential insurance  issued billion in senior secured notes  which we refer to as the ihc debt 
the net proceeds from the issuances of the class b stock and ihc debt  except for million used to purchase a guaranteed investment contract to fund a portion of the bond insurance cost associated with that debt  were allocated to the financial services businesses 
however  we expect that the ihc debt will be serviced by the net cash flows of the closed block business over time  and we include interest expenses associated with the ihc debt when we report results of the closed block business 
the closed block business consists principally of the closed block  assets that we must hold outside the closed block to meet capital requirements related to the closed block policies  invested assets held outside the closed block that represent the difference between the closed block assets and closed block liabilities and the interest maintenance reserve  deferred policy acquisition costs related to closed block policies  the principal amount of the ihc debt and related hedging activities  and certain other related assets and liabilities 
revenues and expenses we earn our revenues principally from insurance premiums  mortality  expense  and asset management fees from insurance and investment products  and investment of general account and other funds 
we earn premiums primarily from the sale of individual life insurance and group life and disability insurance 
we earn mortality  expense  and asset management fees from the sale and servicing of separate account products including variable life insurance and variable annuities 
we also earn asset management and administrative fees from the distribution  servicing and management of mutual funds  retirement products and other asset management products and services 
our operating expenses principally consist of insurance benefits provided  general business expenses  dividends to policyholders  commissions and other costs of selling and servicing the various products we sell and interest credited on general account liabilities 
profitability our profitability depends principally on our ability to price and manage risk on insurance products  our ability to attract and retain customer assets and our ability to manage expenses 
specific drivers of our profitability include our ability to manufacture and distribute products and services and to introduce new products that gain market acceptance on a timely basis  our ability to price our insurance products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the expense of acquiring customers and administering those products  our mortality and morbidity experience on individual and group life insurance  annuity and group disability insurance products  which can fluctuate significantly from period to period  our persistency experience  which affects our ability to recover the cost of acquiring new business over the lives of the contracts  
table of contents our cost of administering insurance contracts and providing asset management products and services  our returns on invested assets  net of the amounts we credit to policyholders accounts  the performance of our investment in wachovia securities financial holdings  llc  or wachovia securities  the amount of our assets under management and changes in their fair value  which affect the amount of asset management fees we receive  our ability to generate favorable investment results through asset liability management and strategic and tactical asset allocation  and our ability to maintain our credit and financial strength ratings 
in addition  factors such as regulation  competition  interest rates  taxes  foreign exchange rates  securities market conditions and general economic conditions affect our profitability 
in some of our product lines  particularly those in the closed block business  we share experience on mortality  morbidity  persistency and investment results with our customers  which can offset the impact of these factors on our profitability from those products 
historically  the participating products included in the closed block have yielded lower returns on capital invested than many of our other businesses 
as we have ceased offering domestic participating products  we expect that the proportion of the traditional participating products in our in force business will gradually diminish as these older policies age  and we grow other businesses 
however  the relatively lower returns to us on this existing block of business will continue to affect our consolidated results of operations for many years 
our common stock reflects the performance of our financial services businesses  but there can be no assurance that the market value of the common stock will reflect solely the performance of these businesses 
see risk factors for a discussion of risks that could materially affect our business  results of operations or financial condition  cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
executive summary prudential financial  one of the largest financial services companies in the us  offers individual and institutional clients a wide array of financial products and services  including life insurance  annuities  mutual funds  pension and retirement related services and administration  asset management  banking and trust services  real estate brokerage and relocation services  and  through a joint venture  retail securities brokerage services 
we offer these products and services through one of the largest distribution networks in the financial services industry 
significant developments and events in reflect our continued efforts to redeploy capital effectively to seek enhanced returns 
these developments included the continuation of our share repurchase program 
in  we repurchased million shares of common stock at a total cost of billion 
in november  prudential financial s board of directors authorized us  under a new stock repurchase program  to repurchase up to billion of our outstanding common stock during a increase in our annual common stock dividend  to per share 
on june   we acquired the variable annuity business of the allstate corporation  or allstate  through a reinsurance transaction for million of total consideration  consisting primarily of a million ceding commission 
our initial investment in the business is approximately million  consisting of the total consideration  offset by the related tax benefits  plus an additional contribution of million to meet regulatory capital requirements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this acquisition 

table of contents we analyze performance of the segments and corporate and other operations of the financial services businesses using a measure called adjusted operating income 
see consolidated results of operations for a definition of adjusted operating income and a discussion of its use as a measure of segment operating performance 
shown below are the contributions of each segment and corporate and other operations to our adjusted operating income for the years ended december   and and a reconciliation of adjusted operating income of our segments and corporate and other operations to income from continuing operations before income taxes  equity in earnings of operating joint ventures  extraordinary gain on acquisition and cumulative effect of accounting change

results benefited in the current year from a net reduction in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and other costs  reflecting updates and refinements of our actuarial assumptions based on an annual review  and from compensation received based on multi year profitability of third party products we distribute 
the benefits of these items to results  together with higher fees reflecting higher asset balances were partially offset by less favorable mortality experience  net of reinsurance  compared to the prior year 
individual annuities segment results for improved in comparison to the prior year due to higher fee income reflecting higher average asset balances as well as a contribution from the variable annuity business acquired from the allstate corporation on june  results for both the current and prior years benefited from reductions in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and other costs  reflecting increased estimates of profitability based on an annual review 
group insurance segment results for improved slightly from the prior year as more favorable claims experience in our group disability business  together with a greater benefit from refinements in group disability reserves and an increased contribution from investment results  were largely offset by less favorable claims experience in our group life business and higher expenses 

table of contents asset management segment results in improved in comparison to the prior year primarily due to greater incentive fees  and income from our proprietary investing business  mainly related to real estate investments 
in addition  segment results benefited from higher asset management fees as a result of increased asset values due to market appreciation and net asset flows 
higher expenses  including performance related compensation costs  were a partial offset 
financial advisory segment results in improved in comparison to the prior year  reflecting lower expenses in related to obligations and costs we retained in connection with the businesses contributed to the retail brokerage joint venture with wachovia  primarily for litigation and regulatory matters  and increased income from our share of the joint venture 
retirement segment results for improved slightly in comparison to the prior year primarily reflecting lower acquisition related transition expenses  higher investment results in our institutional investment products business due principally from a larger base of invested assets and increased fees due to higher full service retirement account values 
these items were partially offset by expenses incurred in in our full service business relating to the expansion of our distribution and client servicing capabilities and costs associated with expense reduction initiatives  lower mortgage prepayment income and higher crediting rates on full service general account liabilities 
international insurance segment results for improved in comparison to the prior year  reflecting more favorable results from the segment s life planner operations  which benefited from continued business growth and more favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
less favorable results from the segment s gibraltar life operations were a partial offset  as lower benefits from reserve refinements  current year guaranty fund assessment costs  and a less favorable level of policy benefits and expenses more than offset improved investment income margins and more favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
international investments segment results in improved in comparison to the prior year due to more favorable results from both the segment s global commodities business  including income representing market value changes on securities held relating to trading exchange memberships  and its asset management operations 
realized investment gains losses  net  and related adjustments for the financial services businesses of million in includes net losses on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities partially offset by a gain on a private fixed maturity related to a korean financial services company and a recovery from a us telecommunications company 
in addition  results for benefited from fluctuations in value of hedging instruments related to our foreign currency risk and investments and from realized investment gains from the sale of equity securities 
closed block business income from continuing operations before income taxes  equity in earnings of operating joint ventures  extraordinary gain on acquisition and cumulative effect of accounting change decreased million from the prior year  reflecting a decrease in net realized investment gains  partially offset by a decrease in dividends to policyholders  which includes a decrease to the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation 
realized investment gains losses  net in reflect lower net gains on both sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities and sales of equity securities and losses due to fluctuations in value of investment related hedges 
accounting policies pronouncements application of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or us gaap  requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment 
management  on an ongoing basis  reviews estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements 
if management determines that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and circumstances  results of operations and financial position as reported in the consolidated financial statements could change significantly 

table of contents the following sections discuss the accounting policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
valuation of investments as prescribed by us gaap  we present our investments classified as available for sale  including fixed maturity and equity securities  and our investments classified as trading  such as our trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities  at fair value in the statements of financial position 
the fair values for our public fixed maturity securities and our public equity securities are based on quoted market prices or prices obtained from independent pricing services 
however  for our investments in private securities such as private placement fixed maturity securities  which comprise of our investments as of december   this information is not available 
for these private fixed maturities  fair value is determined typically by using a discounted cash flow model  which relies upon the average of spread surveys collected from private market intermediaries who are active in both primary and secondary transactions and takes into account  among other factors  the credit quality of the issuer and the reduced liquidity associated with private placements 
the estimated fair value of certain non performing private placement fixed maturities is based on our own estimates 
see realized investment gains and general account investments general account investments fixed maturity securities private fixed maturities credit quality and realized investment gains and general account investments general account investments trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities for information regarding the credit quality of the private fixed maturity securities included in our general account 
for our investments classified as available for sale  the impact of changes in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net  a separate component of equity 
for our investments classified as trading  the impact of changes in fair value is recorded within asset management fees and other income 
in addition  investments classified as available for sale  as well as those classified as held to maturity  are subject to impairment reviews to identify when a decline in value is other than temporary 
factors we consider in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary include the extent generally if greater than and duration generally if greater than six months of the decline  the reasons for the decline in value credit event  currency or interest rate related  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value  and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer 
when it is determined that a decline in value is other than temporary  the carrying value of the security is reduced to its fair value  with a corresponding charge to earnings 
this corresponding charge is referred to as an impairment 
impairments are reflected in realized investment gains losses  net in the statements of operations and are excluded from adjusted operating income 
the new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value 
in periods subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment  the impaired security is accounted for as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the impairment 
accordingly  the discount or reduced premium based on the new cost basis is accreted into net investment income over the remaining life of the security based upon the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and is included in adjusted operating income 
the level of impairment losses can be expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and decrease when economic conditions improve 
see realized investment gains and general account investments realized investment gains for a discussion of the effects of impairments on our operating results for the years ended december   and commercial loans  which comprise of our investments as of december   are carried primarily at unpaid principal balances  net of unamortized premiums or discounts and a valuation allowance for losses 
this valuation allowance includes a loan specific portion as well as a portfolio reserve for probable incurred but not specifically identified losses 
the loan specific portion is based on the company s assessment as to ultimate collectibility of loan principal 
valuation allowances for non performing loans are recorded based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
a non performing loan is defined as a loan for which it is probable that amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected 
the portfolio reserve is based on a number of factors  such as historical experience and portfolio diversification 
we record subsequent adjustments to our valuation allowances when appropriate 
adjustments to the allowance are reflected in realized investment gains losses  net  in our statements of operations 
similar to impairment losses discussed above  the allowance for losses can be expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and decrease when economic conditions improve

table of contents investments general account investments commercial loans commercial loan quality for a discussion of the effects of the valuation allowance on our operating results for the years ended december  and see realized investment gains and general account investments general account investments for a discussion of our investment portfolio  including the gross unrealized gains and losses as of december   related to the fixed maturity and equity securities of our general account  our policies and procedures regarding the identification of other than temporary declines in investment value  and the carrying value  credit quality  and allowance for losses related to the commercial loans of our general account 
policyholder liabilities future policy benefit reserves  other than unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses we establish reserves for future policy benefits to or on behalf of policyholders in the same period in which the policy is issued 
these reserves relate primarily to the traditional participating whole life policies of our closed block business and the non participating whole life  term life  and life contingent structured settlement and group annuity products of our financial services businesses 
the future policy benefit reserves for the traditional participating life insurance products of our closed block business  which as of december   represented of our total future policy benefit reserves are determined using the net level premium method as prescribed by us gaap 
under this method  the future policy benefit reserves are accrued as a level proportion of the premium paid by the policyholder 
in applying this method  we use mortality assumptions to determine our expected future benefits and expected future premiums  and apply an interest rate to determine the present value of both the expected future benefit payments and the expected future premiums 
the mortality assumptions used are based on data from the standard industry mortality tables that were used to determine the cash surrender value of the policies  and the interest rates used are the contractually guaranteed interest rates used to calculate the cash surrender value of the policy 
gains or losses in our results of operations resulting from deviations in actual experience compared to the experience assumed in establishing our reserves for this business are recognized in the determination of our annual dividends to these policyholders 
given our current level of policy dividends  we do not anticipate significant volatility in our results of operations in future periods as a result of these deviations 
the future policy benefit reserves for our international insurance segment and individual life segment  which as of december   represented of our total future policy benefit reserves combined  relate primarily to non participating whole life and term life products and are determined in accordance with us gaap as the present value of expected future benefits to or on behalf of policyholders plus the present value of future maintenance expenses less the present value of future net premiums 
the expected future benefits and expenses are determined using assumptions as to mortality  lapse  and maintenance expense 
reserve assumptions are based on best estimate assumptions as of the date the policy is issued with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation 
after our reserves are initially established  we perform premium deficiency tests using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation 
if reserves determined based on these best estimate assumptions are greater than the net us gaap liabilities us  reserves net of any dac asset  the existing net us gaap liabilities are adjusted to the greater amount 
our best estimate assumptions are determined by product group 
mortality assumptions are generally based on the company s historical experience or standard industry tables  as applicable  our expense assumptions are based on current levels of maintenance costs  adjusted for the effects of inflation  and our interest rate assumptions are based on current and expected net investment returns 
we review our mortality assumptions annually 
generally  we do not expect our mortality trends to change significantly in the short term and to the extent these trends may change we expect such changes to be gradual over the long term 
the reserves for future policy benefits of our retirement segment  which as of december  represented of our total future policy benefit reserves  relate to our non participating life contingent group annuity and structured settlement products 
these reserves are generally determined as the present value of expected future benefits and expenses based on assumptions as to mortality  retirement  maintenance expense  and interest rates 
reserves are based on best estimate assumptions as of the date the contract is issued with 
table of contents provisions for the risk of adverse deviation 
after our reserves are initially established  we perform premium deficiency testing by product group using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation 
if reserves determined based on these assumptions are greater than the existing reserves  the existing reserves are adjusted to the greater amount 
our best estimate assumptions are determined by product group 
our mortality and retirement assumptions are based on company or industry experience  our expense assumptions are based on current levels of maintenance costs  adjusted for the effects of inflation  and our interest rate assumptions are based on current and expected net investment returns 
we generally review our mortality assumptions and conduct a full actuarial study of these assumptions annually 
we conduct a full actuarial study of our retirement assumptions every three to five years 
generally  we do not expect our actual mortality or retirement trends to change significantly in the short term and to the extent these trends may change we expect such changes to be gradual over the long term 
unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses our liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses of billion is reported as a component of future policy benefits and relates primarily to the group long term disability products of our group insurance segment 
this liability represents our estimate of future disability claim payments and expenses as well as estimates of claims that we believe have been incurred  but have not yet been reported as of the balance sheet date 
we do not establish loss liabilities until a loss has occurred 
as prescribed by us gaap  our liability is determined as the present value of expected future claim payments and expenses 
expected future claims payments are estimated using assumed mortality and claim termination factors and an assumed interest rate 
the mortality and claim termination factors are based on standard industry tables and the company s historical experience 
our interest rate assumptions are based on factors such as market conditions and expected investment returns 
of these assumptions  our claim termination assumptions have historically had the most significant effects on our level of liability 
we regularly review our claim termination assumptions compared to actual terminations and conduct full actuarial studies every two years 
these studies review actual claim termination experience over a number of years with more weight placed on the actual experience in the more recent years 
if actual experience results in a materially different assumption  we adjust our liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses accordingly with a charge or credit to current period earnings 
deferred policy acquisition costs we capitalize costs that vary with and are related primarily to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance and annuity contracts 
these costs include primarily commissions  costs of policy issuance and underwriting  and variable field office expenses 
we amortize these deferred policy acquisition costs  or dac  over the expected lives of the contracts  based on the level and timing of either gross margins  gross profits  or gross premiums  depending on the type of contract 
as of december   dac in our financial services businesses was billion and dac in our closed block business was billion 
dac associated with the traditional participating products of our closed block business is amortized over the expected lives of those contracts in proportion to gross margins 
gross margins consider premiums  investment returns  benefit claims  costs for policy administration  changes in reserves  and dividends to policyholders 
we evaluate our estimates of future gross margins and adjust the related dac balance with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the effects of actual gross margins and changes in our expected future gross margins 
since many of the factors that affect gross margins are included in the determination of our dividends to these policyholders  we do not anticipate significant volatility in our results of operations as a result of dac adjustments  given our current level of dividends 
dac associated with the non participating whole life and term life policies of our individual life segment and the non participating whole life  term life and health policies of our international insurance segment is amortized in proportion to gross premiums 
we evaluate the recoverability of our dac related to these policies as part of our premium deficiency testing 
if a premium deficiency exists  we reduce dac by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a charge to current period earnings 
if the deficiency is more than the dac balance  we then increase the reserve for future policy benefits by the excess  by means of a charge to current period earnings 
generally  we do not expect significant short term deterioration in experience  and therefore do not expect significant writedowns to the related dac 

table of contents dac associated with the variable and universal life policies of our individual life segment and the variable and fixed annuity contracts of our individual annuities segment is amortized over the expected life of these policies in proportion to gross profits 
in calculating gross profits  we consider mortality  persistency  and other elements as well as rates of return on investments associated with these contracts 
we regularly evaluate and adjust the related dac balance with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the effects of our actual gross profits and changes in our assumptions regarding estimated future gross profits 
for the variable and universal life policies of our individual life segment  a significant portion of our gross profits is derived from mortality margins 
as a result  our estimates of future gross profits are significantly influenced by our mortality assumptions 
our mortality assumptions represent our expected claims experience over the life of these policies and are developed based on company experience 
we review and update our mortality assumptions annually 
updates to our mortality assumptions in future periods could have a significant adverse or favorable effect on our results of operations 
for a discussion of dac adjustments related to our individual life segment for the years ended december   and  see results of operations for financial services businesses by segment insurance division individual life 
for variable annuity contracts  dac is more sensitive to the effects of changes in our estimates of gross profits due primarily to the significant portion of our gross profits that is dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account investment options  and the shorter average life of the contracts 
this rate of return influences the fees we earn  costs we incur associated with minimum death benefit and other contractual guarantees specific to our variable annuity contracts  as well as other sources of profit 
this is also true  to a lesser degree  for our variable life policies 
the future rate of return assumptions used in evaluating dac for our domestic annuity and variable life insurance products are derived using a reversion to mean approach  a common industry practice 
under this approach  we consider actual returns over a period of time and project returns for the future period so that the assets grow at the expected rate of return for the entire period 
if the projected future rate of return is greater than our maximum future rate of return  we use our maximum reasonable future rate of return 
as part of our approach for variable annuity contracts  if the estimated gross profits under the previously projected rate of return are greater than or less than a range of estimated gross profits determined by statistically generated rate of returns  we change our future assumption to reflect the result of the reversion to the mean approach 
for variable annuities products  our expected rate of return is per annum  which reflects an expected rate of return of per annum for equity type assets 
the future equity rate of return used varies by product  but was under per annum for all of our variable annuity products for our evaluation of deferred policy acquisition costs as of december  the dac balance associated with our domestic variable annuity contracts was billion as of december  the following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of that dac balance relative to our future rate of return assumptions by quantifying the adjustments that we would be required to consider  subject to the range of estimated gross profits determined by the statistically generated rate of returns described above  assuming both an increase and decrease in our future rate of return by basis points 
this information considers only the effect of changes in our future rate of return and not changes in any other assumptions such as persistency  mortality  or expenses included in our evaluation of dac 
december  increase reduction in dac in millions increase in future rate of return by basis points decrease in future rate of return by basis points for a discussion of dac adjustments related to our individual annuities segment for the years ended december   and  see results of operations for financial services businesses by segment insurance division individual annuities 
in addition to dac  we also recognize assets for capitalized sales inducements and valuation of business acquired  or voba 
the deferred sales inducements are amortized using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize deferred policy acquisition costs 
for additional information about our deferred sales 
table of contents inducements  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
voba represents the present value of future profits embedded in acquired businesses 
for additional information about voba including its bases for amortization  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of december of each year and more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
impairment testing requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill  and record an impairment charge if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
the determination of a reporting unit s fair value is based on management s best estimate  which generally considers the unit s expected future earnings and market based earning multiples of peer companies 
as of december   we have million of goodwill reflected on our statements of financial position 
during  we recorded a goodwill impairment of million relating to our dryden wealth management business 
there were no goodwill impairment charges during or pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering employees who meet specific eligibility requirements 
our net periodic costs for these plans consider an assumed discount interest rate  an expected rate of return on plan assets and expected increases in compensation levels and trends in health care costs 
of these assumptions  our expected rate of return assumptions  and to a lesser extent our discount rate assumptions  have historically had the most significant effect on our net period costs associated with these plans 
we determine our expected return on plan assets based upon the arithmetical average of prospective returns  which is based upon a risk free rate as of the measurement date adjusted by a risk premium that considers historical statistics and expected investment manager performance  for equity  debt and real estate markets applied on a weighted average basis to our asset portfolio 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for our actual asset allocations by asset category and the asset allocation ranges prescribed by our investment policy guidelines for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
our assumed long term rate of return for was for our pension plans and for our other postretirement benefit plans 
given the amount of plan assets as of september   the beginning of the measurement year  if we had assumed an expected rate of return for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans that was basis points higher or basis points lower than the rates we assumed  the change in our net periodic costs would have been as shown in the table below 
the information provided in the table below considers only changes in our assumed long term rate of return given the level and mix of invested assets at the beginning of the measurement year  without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed long term rate of return 
for the year ended december  increase decrease in net periodic pension cost increase decrease in net periodic other postretirement cost in millions increase in expected rate of return by basis points decrease in expected rate of return by basis points we determine our discount rate  used to value the pension and postretirement benefit obligations  based upon rates commensurate with current yields on high quality corporate bonds 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the methodology we employ to determine our discount rate 
our assumed discount rate for was for both our pension plans and our other postretirement benefit plans 
given the amount of pensions and postretirement obligation as of september   the beginning of the measurement year  if we had assumed a discount rate for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans that was basis points higher or basis points lower than the rates we assumed  the change in our net periodic costs would have been as shown in the table below 
the information provided in the table below considers only changes in our assumed discount rate without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed discount rate

in addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions  the net periodic cost or benefit from our pension and other postretirement benefit plans may change due to factors such as actual experience being different from our assumptions  special benefits to terminated employees  or changes in benefits provided under the plans 
taxes on income our effective tax rate is based on income  non taxable and non deductible items  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans  planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes 
tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times from the items reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than the actual rate applied on the tax return 
some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences are temporary  reversing over time  such as valuation of insurance reserves 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred  or expenditures for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized in our financial statements 
the application of us gaap requires us to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if necessary to reduce our deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carry forward periods 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  will be realized 
our accounting represents management s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates 
certain changes or future events  such as changes in tax legislation  geographic mix of earnings and completion of tax audits could have an impact on our estimates and effective tax rate 
an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by one percent of income from continuing operations before income taxes  equity in earnings of operating joint ventures  extraordinary gain on acquisition and cumulative effect of accounting change  would have resulted in a decline or increase in consolidated income from continuing operations before equity in earnings of operating joint ventures  extraordinary gain on acquisition and cumulative effect of accounting change in of million 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions 
we reserve for our best estimate of potential payments settlements to be made to the internal revenue service  or service  and other taxing jurisdictions for audits ongoing or not yet commenced 
in  the service completed all fieldwork with regards to its examination of our consolidated federal income tax returns for the tax years and we anticipate the final report to be submitted to the joint committee on taxation for their review during the first quarter of the statute of limitations for the tax years expires in in addition  in january the service began an examination of the tax years through our liability for income taxes includes management s best estimate of potential payments and settlements for audit periods still subject to review by the internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions 
audit 
table of contents periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed 
the completion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to our liability for income taxes 
any such adjustment could be material to our results of operations for any given quarterly or annual period based  in part  upon the results of operations for the given period 
on january   the service officially closed the audit of our consolidated federal income tax returns for the to periods 
as a result of certain favorable resolutions  our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  includes an income tax benefit of million  reflecting a reduction in our liability for income taxes 
for the tax year  we have chosen to participate in the service s new compliance assurance program  or cap 
under cap  the service assigns an examination team to review completed transactions contemporaneously during the tax year in order to reach agreement with us on how they should be reported in the tax return 
if disagreements arise  accelerated resolutions programs are available to resolve the disagreements in a timely manner before the tax return is filed 
it is management s expectation this new program will significantly shorten the time period between when we file our federal income tax return and when the service completes its examination of the return 
reserves for contingencies a contingency is an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved upon the occurrence of future events 
under us gaap  reserves for contingencies are required to be established when the future event is probable and its impact can be reasonably estimated 
an example is the establishment of a reserve for losses in connection with an unresolved legal matter 
the initial reserve reflects management s best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and  ultimately  when the matter is brought to closure 
accounting policies adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding accounting policies adopted including the effect of adopting statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans and statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  and recently issued accounting pronouncements including fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and aicpa statement of position  accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs in connection with modifications or exchanges of insurance contracts 
the following provides additional discussion of certain accounting policies adopted 
share based payments effect of adoption we issued employee stock options during and that were previously accounted for using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board  or apb  no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  an allowable alternative method under statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  prior to its revision 
under apb no 
 we did not recognize any stock based compensation expense for employee stock options as all employee stock options had an exercise price equal to the market value of our common stock at the date of grant 
effective january   we changed our accounting for employee stock options to adopt the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 as amended  prospectively for all new awards granted to employees on or after january  under these provisions  the fair value of all employee stock options awarded on or after january   is included in the determination of net income 
accordingly  the amount we included in the determination of net income for periods prior to january   is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value method had been applied to all awards since inception of the employee stock option plan 
we adopted sfas no 
r on january   using the modified prospective application transition 
table of contents method 
there were no unvested stock options issued prior to january   and  therefore  the adoption of sfas no 
r had no impact to the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations with respect to the unvested employee options 
for the changes required prospectively in accounting for options and awards with non substantive vesting conditions  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of stock options issued to employees as described above  we did not record any compensation cost for employee stock options issued prior to january  however  we are required to disclose the net income and basic and diluted earnings per share that we would have reported if we had been recognizing compensation cost associated with those options 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for this proforma disclosure 
for purposes of this disclosure the fair value of these options was determined using a black scholes option pricing model 
this model considers dividend yield  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  and expected life of the option and uses an equation to produce a fair value 
for options issued on or after january   the fair value of each option was estimated using a binomial option pricing model 
this model also considers dividend yield  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  and expected life of the option but  unlike the black scholes options pricing model  it produces an estimated fair value based on the assumed changes in price of a financial instrument over successive periods of time 
we selected the binomial option pricing model because  absent observable market prices  we believe it produces a fair value that best reflects the substantive characteristics of the employee stock options we issue 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for the assumptions used in valuing employee stock options issued in   and excess tax benefits an excess tax benefit is generated whenever the tax deduction associated with share based payment arrangements exceeds the related cumulative compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes 
excess tax benefits are included in additional paid in capital in the period that the related tax deduction reduces our taxes payable 
if the tax deduction associated with share based payment arrangements is less than the cumulative compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes  the unused portion of the deferred tax asset is first offset against additional paid in capital generated from past excess tax benefits then charged to tax expense 
as of the date of adoption of sfas no 
r  we were required to determine the portion of our additional paid in capital that was generated from the realization of excess tax benefits prior to the date of adoption and is therefore available to offset deferred tax assets that may need to be written off in future periods had we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
beginning in we chose to calculate this pool of additional paid in capital using the alternative transition  or short cut  method provided for in fasb staff position fas r  transition election to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
under the short cut method  this pool of additional paid in capital was calculated as the sum of all net increases of additional paid in capital recognized in our financial statements related to tax benefits from share based payment transactions subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
but prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r less the cumulative incremental pre tax compensation costs that would have been recognized if sfas no 
had been used to account for share based payment transactions  tax effected at our statutory tax rate as of the adoption of sfas no 
r 
effect on calculation of diluted earnings per share of common stock in calculating the dilutive effect of share based payment arrangements such as stock options issued to employees  we apply the treasury stock method prescribed by sfas no 
 earnings per share 
in applying the treasury stock method to such arrangements we consider hypothetical excess tax benefits that would be recognized assuming all employee options are exercised and shares issued to employees vest 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r  we can now only include in this calculation the hypothetical excess tax benefits that would have resulted in a reduction of taxes payable in the current period 
prior to our adoption of sfas no 
r  we considered hypothetical excess tax benefits in applying the treasury stock method if it was probable that the excess tax benefit would be utilized for tax purposes prior to its expiration 
as described above  we did not use the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 as amended  for employee stock options issued prior to january  in applying the treasury stock method to these options  
table of contents prior to our adoption of sfas no 
r  the hypothetical excess tax benefit from these options was calculated as the entire amount deductible on our tax return 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we elected to continue to apply this calculation methodology for options issued to employees prior to january  consolidated results of operations the following table summarizes net income for the financial services businesses and the closed block business for the periods presented

the direct equity adjustment increased income from continuing operations before extraordinary gain on acquisition and cumulative effect of accounting change available to holders of the common stock for earnings per share purposes by million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  the direct equity adjustment modifies earnings available to holders of the common stock and the class b stock for earnings per share purposes 
the holders of the common stock will benefit from the direct equity adjustment as long as reported administrative expenses of the closed block business are less than the cash flows for administrative expenses determined by the policy servicing fee arrangement that is based upon insurance and policies in force and statutory cash premiums 
as statutory cash premiums and policies in force in the closed block business decline  we expect the benefit to the common stock holders from the direct equity adjustment to decline accordingly 
if the reported administrative expenses of the closed block business exceed the cash flows for administrative expenses determined by the policy servicing fee arrangement  the direct equity adjustment will reduce income available to holders of the common stock for earnings per share purposes

for the financial services businesses  we analyze our segments operating performance using adjusted operating income 
results of the closed block business for all periods are evaluated and presented only in accordance with us gaap 
adjusted operating income does not equate to income from continuing operations before income taxes  equity in earnings of operating joint ventures  extraordinary gain on acquisition and cumulative effect of accounting change or net income as determined in accordance with us gaap but is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources  and consistent with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  is our measure of segment performance 
adjusted operating income is calculated for the segments of the financial services businesses by adjusting each segment s income from continuing operations before income taxes  equity in earnings of operating joint ventures  extraordinary gain on acquisition and cumulative effect of accounting change for the following items realized investment gains losses  net  except as indicated below  and related charges and adjustments  net investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and changes in experience rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes  the contribution to income loss of divested businesses that have been or will be sold or exited that do not qualify for discontinued operations accounting treatment under us gaap  and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures 
the items above are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations 
adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with us gaap  and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies 
however  we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of the financial services businesses 
adjusted operating income excludes realized investment gains losses  net  except as indicated below  and related charges and adjustments 
a significant element of realized investment gains and losses are impairments and credit related and interest rate related gains and losses 
impairments and losses from sales of credit impaired securities  the timing of which depends largely on market credit cycles  can vary considerably across periods 
the timing of other sales that would result in gains or losses  such as interest rate related gains or losses  is largely subject to our discretion and influenced by market opportunities  as well as our tax profile 
trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of these transactions 
similarly  adjusted operating income excludes investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and changes in experience rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes  because these recorded changes in asset and liability values will ultimately accrue to the contractholders 
adjusted operating income excludes the results of divested businesses because they are not relevant to understanding our ongoing operating results 
the contributions to income loss of wind down businesses that we have not divested remain in adjusted operating income 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the presentation of segment results 
as noted above  certain realized investment gains losses  net  are included in adjusted operating income 
we include in adjusted operating income the portion of our realized investment gains and losses on derivatives that arise from the termination of contracts used to hedge our foreign currency earnings in the same period that the expected earnings emerge 
similarly  we include in adjusted operating income the portion of our 
table of contents realized investment gains and losses on derivatives that represent current period yield adjustments 
the realized investment gains or losses from products that are free standing derivatives  or contain embedded derivatives  along with the realized investment gains or losses from associated derivative portfolios that are part of an economic hedging program related to the risk of these products  are included in adjusted operating income 
adjusted operating income also includes for certain embedded derivatives  as current period yield adjustments  a portion of the cumulative realized investment gains  on an amortized basis over the remaining life of the related security  or cumulative realized investment losses in the period incurred 
adjusted operating income also includes those realized investment gains and losses that represent profit or loss of certain of our businesses which primarily originate investments for sale or syndication to unrelated investors

adjusted operating income to annual comparison 
adjusted operating income increased million  from million in to million in adjusted operating income for includes a million benefit from a net reduction in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and other costs 
the net reduction in amortization and other costs is due to an increased estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs and unearned revenue reserves  based on an annual review  primarily reflecting improved mortality and lower maintenance expenses  partially offset by refinements in other reserves 
results for also improved million from the prior year  as the current year includes a million benefit and the prior year included a million benefit from compensation received based on multi year profitability of third party products we distribute 
the benefits of these items to results  together with higher fees resulting from higher asset balances reflecting market value changes and increased net investment income  net of interest credited and interest expense  primarily reflecting higher yields in  were partially offset by less favorable mortality experience  net of reinsurance  compared to the prior year

table of contents revenues to annual comparison 
revenues  as shown in the table above under operating results  decreased million  from billion in to billion in policy charges and fee income decreased million  including million due to the update of our assumptions related to amortization of unearned revenue reserves  discussed above  amounting to a million reduction in  and a similar update in resulting in a million increase which was more than offset by an increase in amortization of dac net of a decrease in change in reserves 
partially offsetting this decrease in revenues was an increase in premiums of million  primarily due to increased premiums on term life insurance reflecting continued growth of our in force block of term insurance products 
net investment income increased million  reflecting higher assets and higher yields in  which included the benefit from the sale of lower yielding bonds and reinvestment of proceeds at higher interest rates 
the realized investment losses generated from these sales are excluded from adjusted operating income

the remainder of the increase in policy charges and fee income reflects growth in our universal life business 
net investment income increased million  from million in to million in  reflecting an increased asset base largely due to increased borrowings  which resulted in increased interest expense 
partially offsetting these items was a decrease in asset management fees and other income  primarily reflecting a decline in revenues from the distribution of non proprietary insurance products by our agents  which decline was partially offset by a decline in operating expenses  including agent commissions on sales of these products

sales of the individual life insurance business do not correspond to revenues under us gaap 
they are  however  a relevant measure of business activity 
in managing our individual life insurance business  we analyze new sales on this basis because it measures the current sales performance of the business  while revenues primarily reflect the renewal persistency and aging of in force policies written in prior years and net investment income as well as current sales

partially offsetting these benefits to adjusted operating income was an increase to amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs reflecting increased gross profits in the current period 
revenues to annual comparison 
revenues  as shown in the table above under operating results  increased million  from billion in to billion in  including revenues of million from the allstate business acquired during the second quarter of the remainder of the increase in revenues  million  came primarily from increases of million in policy charges and fees and million in asset management fees and other income  which includes million from the mark to market of embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with our living benefits features 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in net investment income 
the increase in policy charges and fees reflects an increase in the average market value of variable annuity account values and positive net flows in our variable annuities  including an increase in account values with living benefit options 
the increase in asset management fees and other income was primarily due to an increase in asset based fees driven by an increase in the average market value of variable annuity customer accounts and positive net flows of our variable annuities 
the decrease in net investment income came primarily from the impact of a shift in customer funds from fixed income investments to variable investments 
in addition  net investment income for included the collection of investment

international insurance and investments division as a us based company with significant business operations outside the us  we seek to mitigate the risk that future unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements will reduce our us dollar equivalent earnings 
the operations of our international insurance and international investments segments are subject to 
table of contents currency fluctuations that can materially affect their us dollar results from period to period even if results on a local currency basis are relatively constant 
as discussed further below  we enter into forward currency derivative contracts  as well as dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments as part of our strategy to effectively fix the currency exchange rates for a portion of our prospective non us dollar denominated earnings streams 
the financial results of our international insurance segment and international investments segment  excluding the global commodities group  for all periods presented reflect the impact of an intercompany arrangement with corporate and other operations pursuant to which the segments non us dollar denominated earnings in all countries are translated at fixed currency exchange rates 
the fixed rates are determined in connection with a currency hedging program designed to mitigate the risk that unfavorable exchange rate changes will reduce the segments us dollar equivalent earnings 
pursuant to this program  corporate and other operations executes forward currency contracts with third parties to sell the hedged currency in exchange for us dollars at a specified exchange rate 
the maturities of these contracts correspond with the future periods in which the identified non us dollar denominated earnings are expected to be generated 
this program is primarily associated with the international insurance segment s businesses in japan  korea and taiwan and the international investments segment s businesses in korea and europe

the net effect of this program within the corporate and other operations was losses of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in addition  our japanese insurance operations hold dual currency investments in the form of fixed maturities and loans 
the principal of these dual currency investments are yen denominated while the related interest income is us dollar denominated 
these investments are the economic equivalent of exchanging what would otherwise be fixed streams of yen denominated interest income for fixed streams of us dollars 
our japanese insurance operations also hold investments in yen denominated investments that have been coupled with cross currency coupon swap agreements  creating synthetic dual currency investments 
the yen us dollar exchange rate is effectively fixed  as we are obligated in future periods to exchange fixed amounts of japanese yen interest payments generated by the yen denominated investments for us dollars at the yen us dollar exchange rates specified by the cross currency coupon swap agreements 
the effect of these reverse dual currency and synthetic reverse dual currency investments is taken into account as part of our currency hedging program

to provide a better understanding of operating performance within the international insurance segment  where indicated below  we have analyzed our results of operations excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations 
our results of operations excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations were derived by translating foreign currencies to us dollars at uniform exchange rates for all periods presented  including japanese yen at a rate of yen per us dollar  and korean won at a rate of  won per us dollar 
new annualized premiums presented on a constant exchange rate basis in the sales results section below reflect translation based on these same uniform exchange rates

investment margins and other profitability factors many of our insurance products sold in international markets provide for the buildup of cash values for the policyholder at mandated guaranteed interest rates 
japanese authorities regulate interest rates guaranteed in our japanese insurance contracts 
the regulated guaranteed interest rates do not necessarily match the actual returns 
table of contents on the underlying investments 
the spread between the actual investment returns and these guaranteed rates of return to the policyholder is an element of the profit or loss that we will experience on these products 
with regulatory approval  guaranteed rates may be changed on new business 
while these actions enhance our ability to set rates commensurate with available investment returns  the major sources of profitability on our products sold in japan  other than those sold by gibraltar life  are margins on mortality  morbidity and expense charges rather than investment spreads 
we base premiums and cash values in most countries in which we operate on mandated mortality and morbidity tables

although closed block experience for dividend action decisions is based upon statutory results  at the time the closed block was established  we developed  as required by us gaap  an actuarial calculation of the timing of the maximum future earnings from the policies included in the closed block 
if actual cumulative earnings in any given period are greater than the cumulative earnings we expected  we will record this excess as a policyholder dividend obligation 
we will subsequently pay this excess to closed block policyholders as an additional dividend unless it is otherwise offset by future closed block performance that is less favorable than we originally expected

as of december   the company has recognized a policyholder dividend obligation to closed block policyholders for the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings of million 
actual cumulative earnings  as required by us gaap  reflect the recognition of realized investment gains in the current period  as well as changes in assets and related liabilities that support the policies 
additionally  net unrealized investment gains have arisen subsequent to the establishment of the closed block due to the impact of lower interest rates on the market value of fixed maturities available for sale

realized investment gains and general account investments realized investment gains realized investment gains and losses are generated from numerous sources  including the sale of fixed maturity securities  equity securities  investments in joint ventures and limited partnerships and other types of investments  as well as adjustments to the cost basis of investments for other than temporary impairments 
realized investment gains and losses are also generated from prepayment premiums received on private fixed maturity securities  recoveries of principal on previously impaired securities  provisions for losses on commercial loans  fair value changes on commercial mortgage operations loans  gains on commercial loans in connection with securitization transactions  fair value changes on embedded derivatives and derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  except those derivatives used in our capacity as a broker or dealer 
we perform impairment reviews on an ongoing basis to determine when a decline in value is other than temporary 
in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consider several factors including  but not limited to  the following the extent generally if greater than and duration generally if greater than six months of the decline in value  the reasons for the decline credit event  currency or interest rate related  our ability and intent to hold our investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value  and the financial condition of and near term prospects of the issuer 
when we determine that there is an other than temporary impairment  we write down the value of the security to its fair value  with a corresponding charge recorded in realized investment gains losses  net 
the causes of the impairments discussed below were specific to each individual issuer and did not directly result in impairments to other securities within the same industry or geographic region

for a further discussion of our policies 
table of contents regarding other than temporary declines in investment value and the related methodology for recording equity impairments  see general account investments equity securities impairments of equity securities below 
the level of impairments generally reflects economic conditions and is expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and to decrease when economic conditions improve 
we may realize additional credit and interest rate related losses through sales of investments pursuant to our credit risk and portfolio management objectives 
impairments  interest rate related losses and credit losses are excluded from adjusted operating income 
we require most issuers of private fixed maturity securities to pay us make whole yield maintenance payments when they prepay the securities 
prepayments are driven by factors specific to the activities of our borrowers as well as the interest rate environment 
we use interest and currency swaps and other derivatives to manage interest and currency exchange rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities  including duration mismatches 
we also use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk that unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates will reduce us dollar equivalent earnings generated by certain of our non us businesses 
derivative contracts also include forward purchases and sales of to be announced mortgage backed securities primarily related to our mortgage dollar roll program 
many of these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting  and  consequently  we recognize the changes in fair value of such contracts from period to period in current earnings  although we do not necessarily account for the related assets or liabilities the same way 
accordingly  realized investment gains and losses from our derivative activities can contribute significantly to fluctuations in net income 
adjusted operating income excludes realized investment gains losses  net  other than those representing profit or loss of certain of our businesses which primarily originate investments for sale or syndication to unrelated investors  and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings  current period yield adjustments  or product derivatives and the effect of any related economic hedging program and related charges and adjustments

general account investments we maintain a diversified investment portfolio in our insurance companies to support our liabilities to customers in our financial services businesses and the closed block business  as well as our other general liabilities 
our general account does not include assets of our securities brokerage  securities trading  banking operations  real estate and relocation services  and assets of our asset management operations  including assets managed for third parties  and those assets classified as separate account assets on our balance sheet 
the general account portfolio is managed pursuant to the distinct objectives of the financial services businesses and the closed block business 
the primary investment objectives of the financial services businesses include matching the liability characteristics of the major products and other obligations of the company  and maximizing the portfolio book yield within risk constraints 
our strategies for maximizing the portfolio book yield of the financial services businesses include the investment of proceeds from investment sales  repayments and prepayments  and operating cash flows  into optimally yielding investments  and where appropriate  the sale of the portfolio s lower yielding investments  either to meet various cash flow needs or to manage the portfolio s duration  credit  currency and other risk constraints  all while minimizing the amount of taxes on realized capital gains 
the primary investment objectives of the closed block business include providing for the reasonable dividend expectations of the participating policyholders within the closed block business and the class b shareholders  and maximizing total return and preserving principal  within risk constraints  while matching the liability characteristics of the major products in the closed block business 

table of contents management of investments we design asset mix strategies for our general account to match the characteristics of our products and other obligations and seek to closely approximate the interest rate sensitivity of the assets with the estimated interest rate sensitivity of the product liabilities 
we achieve income objectives through asset liability management and strategic and tactical asset allocations within a disciplined risk management framework 
for a discussion of our risk management process see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management  market risk and derivative instruments and other than trading activities insurance and annuity products asset liability management 
our asset allocation also reflects our desire for broad diversification across asset classes  sectors and issuers 
the asset management segment manages virtually all of our investments  other than those managed by our international insurance segment  under the direction of the asset liability and risk management group 
our international insurance segment manages the majority of its investments locally 
the investment committee of our board of directors oversees our proprietary investments 
it also reviews performance and risk positions quarterly 
our senior vice president  asset liability and risk management  approves the investment policy for the general account assets of our insurance subsidiaries and oversees the investment process for our general account and has the authority to initiate tactical shifts within exposure ranges approved annually by the investment committee 
the asset liability and risk management group works closely with each of our business units to develop investment objectives  performance factors and measures and asset allocation ranges and to ensure that the specific characteristics of our products are incorporated into its processes 
we adjust this dynamic process as products change  as customer behavior changes and as changes in the market environment occur 
we develop asset strategies for specific classes of product liabilities and attributed or accumulated surplus  each with distinct risk characteristics 
most of our products can be categorized into the following three classes interest crediting products for which the rates credited to customers are periodically adjusted to reflect market and competitive forces and actual investment experience  such as fixed annuities and universal life insurance  participating individual and experience rated group products in which customers participate in actual investment and business results through annual dividends  interest or return of premium  and guaranteed products for which there are price or rate guarantees for the life of the contract  such as gics 
we determine a target asset mix for each product class  which we reflect in our investment policies 
our asset liability management process has permitted us to manage interest sensitive products successfully through several market cycles 
portfolio composition our investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities  commercial loans  equity securities and other invested assets

credit derivative exposure to public fixed maturities in addition to the credit exposure from public fixed maturities noted above  we sell credit derivatives to enhance the return on our investment portfolio by creating credit exposure similar to an investment in public fixed maturity cash instruments 
in a credit derivative we sell credit protection on an identified name  or a basket of names in a first to default structure  and in return receive a quarterly premium 
with single name credit default derivatives  this premium or credit spread generally corresponds to the difference between the yield on the referenced name s public fixed maturity cash instruments and swap rates  at the time the agreement is executed 
with first to default baskets  because of the additional credit risk inherent in a basket of named credits  the premium generally corresponds to a high proportion of the sum of the credit spreads of the names in the basket 
if there is an event of default by the referenced name or one of the referenced names in a basket  as defined by the agreement  then we are obligated to pay the counterparty the referenced amount of the contract and receive in return the referenced defaulted security or similar security 
subsequent defaults on the remaining names within such instruments require no further payment to counterparties 
the majority of referenced names in the credit derivatives where we have sold credit protection  as well as all the counterparties to these agreements  are investment grade credit quality and our credit derivatives generally have maturities of five years or less 
as of december  and december   we had  million and  million  respectively  in outstanding notional amounts of credit derivative contracts where we have sold credit protection 
the financial services businesses had  million and  million of outstanding notional amounts as of december  and december   respectively 
the closed block business had million and million  as of december  and december   respectively 
credit derivative contracts are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value  including the premium received  recorded in realized investment gains losses  net

our public fixed maturity asset managers formally review all public fixed maturity holdings on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades  unexpected price variances  and or industry specific concerns 
for private placements our credit and portfolio management processes help ensure prudent controls over valuation and management 
we have separate pricing and authorization processes to establish checks and balances for new investments 
we apply consistent standards of credit analysis and due diligence for all transactions  whether they originate through our own in house origination staff or through agents 
our regional offices closely monitor the portfolios in their regions 
we set all valuation standards centrally  and we assess the fair value of all investments quarterly 
fixed maturity securities classified as held to maturity are those securities where we have the intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity 
these securities are reflected at amortized cost in our consolidated statements of financial position 
other fixed maturity securities are considered available for sale  and  as a result  we record unrealized gains and losses to the extent that amortized cost is different from estimated fair value 
all held to maturity securities and all available for sale securities with unrealized losses are subject to our review to identify other than temporary impairments in value 
in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consider several factors including  but not limited to  the following the extent generally if greater than and the duration generally if greater than six months of the decline  the reasons for the decline in value credit event  currency or interest rate related  our ability and intent to hold our investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value  and the financial condition of and near term prospects of the issuer 
when we determine that there is an other than temporary impairment  we record a writedown to estimated fair value  which reduces the cost basis 
the new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value 
in periods subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment  the impaired security is accounted for as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the impairment 
accordingly  the discount or reduced premium based on the new cost basis is accreted into net 
table of contents investment income over the remaining life of the security based upon the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and is included in adjusted operating income 
estimated fair values for fixed maturities  other than private placement securities  are based on quoted market prices or prices obtained from independent pricing services 
for these private fixed maturities  fair value is determined typically by using a discounted cash flow model  which relies upon the average of spread surveys collected from private market intermediaries who are active in both primary and secondary transactions and takes into account  among other factors  the credit quality of the issuer and the reduced liquidity associated with private placements 
the estimated fair value of certain non performing private placement fixed maturities is based on management s estimates

consumer loans are loans extended by gibraltar life to individuals for financing purchases of consumer goods and services and are guaranteed by third party guarantor companies 
ongoing surveillance of the portfolio is performed and loans are placed on watch list status based on a predefined set of criteria 
we place loans on early warning status in cases where we detect that the physical condition of the property  the financial situation of the borrower or tenant or other market factors could lead to a loss of principal or interest 
we classify loans as closely monitored when there is a collateral deficiency or other credit events that will lead to a potential loss of principal or interest 
loans not in good standing are those loans where there is a high probability of loss of principal  such as when the loan is in the process of foreclosure or the borrower is in bankruptcy 
in our domestic operations  our workout and special servicing professionals manage the loans on the watch list

these sources of funds are complemented by prudential financial s access to the capital markets and bank facilities

prudential financial s capitalization and use of financial leverage are consistent with its ratings targets

table of contents senior debt rating targets for prudential financial are a for standard poor s rating services  or s p  moody s investors service  inc  or moody s  and fitch ratings ltd  or fitch  and a for am best company  or am best 
we seek to capitalize all of our subsidiaries and businesses in accordance with their ratings targets 
our financial strength rating targets for our domestic life insurance companies are aa aa aa for s p  moody s and fitch  respectively  and a for am best 
for our current ratings information see business ratings 
the primary components of capitalization for the financial services businesses consist of the equity we attribute to the financial services businesses excluding accumulated other comprehensive income related to unrealized gains and losses on investments and pension and postretirement benefits and outstanding capital debt of the financial services businesses  as discussed below under financing activities 
based on these components  the capital position of the financial services businesses as of december  was as follows december  in millions attributed equity excluding unrealized gains and losses on investments and pension postretirement benefits capital debt total capital our capital debt to total capital ratio was as of december  as shown in the table above  as of december   the financial services businesses had approximately billion in capital  all of which was available to support the aggregate capital requirements of its three divisions and its corporate and other operations 
based on our assessments of these businesses and operations  we believe that this level of capital exceeds the amount required to support current business risks by at least billion as of december  although some of these resources are in our regulated subsidiaries  and their availability may be subject to prior regulatory notice  approval or non disapproval  we believe these resources give us substantial financial flexibility 
we believe migrating toward a capital structure comprised of attributed equity  capital debt and hybrid equity securities is consistent with our ratings objectives for prudential financial  and would support the issuance of approximately billion of additional capital debt and hybrid equity securities 
this capital structure assumes that the hybrid equity securities we issue achieve equity credit  with the remaining treated as capital debt  and that market conditions exist which make hybrid equity securities a cost effective source of capital 
the risk based capital  or rbc  ratio is the primary measure by which we evaluate the capital adequacy of prudential insurance  which includes businesses in both the financial services businesses and the closed block business 
we manage prudential insurance s rbc ratio to a level consistent with our ratings targets 
rbc is determined by statutory formulas that consider risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets  insurance related risks associated with prudential insurance s products  interest rate risks and general business risks 
the rbc ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring the adequacy of prudential insurance s statutory capitalization 
in the second quarter of  prudential insurance declared an ordinary dividend of billion and an additional extraordinary dividend of million to prudential holdings  llc  or prudential holdings 
prudential holdings then distributed billion of those dividends to prudential financial  which excludes the portion of the dividends allocated to the closed block business 
also in the second quarter of  american skandia life assurance corporation paid an extraordinary distribution of million to american skandia  which american skandia subsequently paid as a dividend to prudential financial 
in the third quarter of  prudential insurance declared an extraordinary dividend of million to prudential holdings  which was subsequently distributed to prudential financial 
uses of capital share repurchases 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million shares of our common stock at a total cost of billion 

table of contents in november  prudential financial s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to billion of its outstanding common stock in calendar year the timing and amount of any repurchases under this authorization will be determined by management based upon market conditions and other considerations  and the repurchases may be effected in the open market  through derivative  accelerated repurchase and other negotiated transactions and through prearranged trading plans complying with rule b c of the exchange act 
the stock repurchase program supersedes all previous repurchase programs 
demutualization consideration 
for the year ended december   prudential financial paid million in demutualization consideration to eligible policyholders whom we have located since the time of demutualization and to governmental authorities in respect of other eligible policyholders whom we continue to be unable to locate 
we remain obligated to disburse million of demutualization consideration to the states if we are unable to establish contact with eligible policyholders within time periods prescribed by state unclaimed property laws 
these laws historically required remittance after periods ranging from three to seven years  but many states have enacted laws that reduce these holding periods to accelerate the reporting of unclaimed demutualization property 
restrictions on dividends and returns of capital from subsidiaries our insurance and various other companies are subject to regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends and other transfers of funds to affiliates 
with respect to prudential insurance  new jersey insurance law provides that  except in the case of extraordinary dividends or distributions  all dividends or distributions paid by prudential insurance may be declared or paid only from unassigned surplus  as determined pursuant to statutory accounting principles  less unrealized investment gains and revaluation of assets 
as of december  and  prudential insurance s unassigned surplus was billion and billion  respectively 
prudential insurance recorded applicable adjustments for unrealized investment gains of billion and million  as of december  and  respectively 
prudential insurance must also notify the new jersey department of banking and insurance of its intent to pay a dividend 
if the dividend  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months  would exceed a specified statutory limit  prudential insurance must also obtain the prior non disapproval of the department 
the current statutory limitation applicable to new jersey life insurers generally is the greater of of the prior calendar year s statutory surplus  billion as of december   or the prior calendar year s statutory net gain from operations excluding realized investment gains and losses  million for the year ended december  in addition to these regulatory limitations  the terms of the ihc debt contain restrictions potentially limiting dividends by prudential insurance applicable to the financial services businesses in the event the closed block business is in financial distress and under certain other circumstances 
the laws regulating dividends of the other states and foreign jurisdictions where our other insurance companies are domiciled are similar  but not identical  to new jersey s 
pursuant to gibraltar life s reorganization  in addition to regulatory restrictions  there are certain restrictions on gibraltar life s ability to pay dividends to prudential financial 
we anticipate that it will be several years before these restrictions will allow gibraltar life to pay dividends 
there are also regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by the prudential life insurance company  ltd  or prudential of japan 
on july   prudential of japan declared a dividend of billion  or approximately million  to prudential international insurance holdings  ltd  which subsequently distributed that amount to prudential financial 
the ability of our asset management subsidiaries  and the majority of our other operating subsidiaries  to pay dividends is largely unrestricted

liquidity of subsidiaries domestic insurance subsidiaries general liquidity liquidity refers to a company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the needs of its operations 
we manage the liquidity of our domestic insurance operations to ensure stable  reliable and cost effective sources of cash flows to meet all of our obligations 
liquidity is provided by a variety of sources  as described more fully below  including portfolios of liquid assets 
the investment portfolios of our domestic operations are integral to the overall liquidity of those operations 
we segment our investment portfolios and employ an asset liability management approach specific to the requirements of our product lines 
this enhances the discipline applied in managing the liquidity  as well as the interest rate and credit risk profiles  of each portfolio in a manner consistent with the unique characteristics of the product liabilities 
we use a projection process for cash flows from operations to ensure sufficient liquidity to meet projected cash outflows  including claims 
liquidity is measured against internally developed benchmarks that take into account the characteristics of the asset portfolio 
the results are affected substantially by the overall asset type and quality of our investments 
cash flow the principal sources of liquidity for prudential insurance and our other domestic insurance subsidiaries are premiums and annuity considerations  investment and fee income and investment maturities and sales associated with our insurance and annuity operations 
the principal uses of that liquidity include benefits  claims  dividends paid to policyholders  and payments to policyholders and contractholders in connection with surrenders  withdrawals and net policy loan activity 
other uses of liquidity include commissions  general and administrative expenses  purchases of investments  and payments in connection with financing activities 
we believe that the cash flows from our insurance and annuity operations are adequate to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of these operations  including under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios 
the continued adequacy of this liquidity will depend upon factors such as future securities market conditions  changes in interest rate levels and policyholder perceptions of our financial strength  each of which could lead to reduced cash inflows or increased cash outflows 
our domestic insurance operations cash flows from investment activities result from repayments of principal  proceeds from maturities and sales of invested assets and investment income  net of amounts reinvested 
the primary liquidity risks with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors  our counterparties willingness to extend repurchase and or securities lending arrangements and market volatility 
we closely manage these risks through our credit risk management process and regular monitoring of our liquidity position 

table of contents in managing the liquidity of our domestic insurance operations  we also consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions in selecting assets to support these contractual obligations 
we use surrender charges and other contract provisions to mitigate the extent  timing and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers from annuity contracts and deposit liabilities 
the following table sets forth withdrawal characteristics of our general account annuity reserves and deposit liabilities based on statutory liability values as of the dates indicated 
december  december  amount of total amount of total in millions not subject to discretionary withdrawal provisions subject to discretionary withdrawal  with adjustment with market value adjustment at market value at contract value  less surrender charge of or more subtotal subject to discretionary withdrawal at contract value with no surrender charge or surrender charge of less than total annuity reserves and deposit liabilities individual life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than our annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur surrender charges and be subject to a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy 
annuity benefits under group annuity contracts are generally not subject to early withdrawal 
gross account withdrawals for our domestic insurance operations products amounted to billion and billion for the years ended december  and  respectively 
because these withdrawals were consistent with our assumptions in asset liability management  the associated cash outflows did not have a material adverse impact on our overall liquidity 
liquid assets liquid assets include cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  fixed maturities that are not designated as held to maturity  and public equity securities 
as of december  and  our domestic insurance operations had liquid assets of billion and billion  respectively 
the portion of liquid assets comprised of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments was billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   billion  or  of the fixed maturity investments that are not designated as held to maturity within our domestic insurance company general account portfolios were rated investment grade 
the remaining billion  or  of these fixed maturity investments were rated non investment grade 
we consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets for example  type of asset and credit quality in calculating internal liquidity measures in order to evaluate the adequacy of our domestic insurance operations liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios 
we believe that the liquidity profile of our assets is sufficient to satisfy current liquidity requirements  including under foreseeable stress scenarios 
given the size and liquidity profile of our investment portfolios  we believe that claim experience varying from our projections does not constitute a significant liquidity risk 
our asset liability management process takes into account the expected maturity of investments and expected claim payments as well as the specific nature and risk profile of the liabilities 
historically  there has been no significant variation between the expected maturities of our investments and the payment of claims 
our domestic insurance companies liquidity is managed through access to substantial investment portfolios as well as a variety of instruments available for funding and or managing short term cash flow mismatches  including from time to time those arising from claim levels in excess of projections 
to the extent we need to pay claims in excess of projections  we may borrow temporarily or sell investments sooner than anticipated to pay these claims  which may result in realized investment gains or losses or increased borrowing costs affecting 
table of contents results of operations 
for a further discussion of realized investment gains or losses  see realized investment gains and general account investments realized investment gains 
we believe that borrowing temporarily or selling investments earlier than anticipated will not have a material impact on the liquidity of our domestic insurance companies 
payment of claims and sale of investments earlier than anticipated would have an impact on the reported level of cash flow from operating and investing activities  respectively  in our financial statements

of those amounts  billion and billion  respectively  were associated with gibraltar life  our largest international insurance subsidiary 
concurrent with our acquisition of gibraltar life in april  substantially all of its insurance liabilities were restructured under a plan of reorganization to include special surrender penalties on existing policies 
these charges mitigate the extent  timing  and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers and apply to billion of gibraltar life s insurance related reserves as of december  and 
table of contents the following table sets forth the schedule for each fiscal year ending march of special surrender charges on policies that are in force policies issued by gibraltar life post acquisition are not subject to the above restructured policy surrender charge schedule

prudential of japan had billion and billion of general account insurance related liabilities  other than dividends to policyholders  as of december  and  respectively 
prudential of japan did not have a material amount of general account annuity reserves or deposit liabilities subject to discretionary withdrawal as of december  or additionally  we believe that the individual life insurance policies sold by prudential of japan do not have significant withdrawal risk because policyholders may incur surrender charges and must undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy

we consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets for example  type of asset and credit quality in calculating internal liquidity measures to evaluate the adequacy of our international insurance operations liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios 
we believe that ongoing operations and the liquidity profile of our international insurance assets provide sufficient current liquidity  including under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios 
asset management subsidiaries our asset management businesses  which include real estate  public and private fixed income and public equity asset management  as well as commercial mortgage origination  servicing and securitization  proprietary investing and retail investment products  such as mutual funds and wrap fee products  are largely unregulated from the standpoint of dividends and distributions 
our asset management subsidiaries through which we conduct these businesses generally do not have restrictions on the amount of distributions they can make  and they provide a stable source of significant cash flow to prudential financial 
the principal sources of liquidity for our asset management subsidiaries include asset management fees  revenues from proprietary investments and commercial mortgage operations  and available borrowing lines from internal sources including prudential funding and prudential financial  as well as from third parties

we use these facilities primarily as back up liquidity lines for our commercial paper programs  and there were no outstanding borrowings under any of these facilities as of december  our ability to borrow under these facilities is conditioned on the continued satisfaction of customary conditions  including maintenance at all times by prudential insurance of total adjusted capital of at least billion based on statutory accounting principles prescribed under new jersey law

table of contents contractual obligations the table below summarizes the future estimated cash payments related to certain contractual obligations as of december  the estimated payments reflected in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the actual cash outflows in future periods will vary  possibly materially  from those reflected in the table 
in addition  we do not believe that our cash flow requirements can be adequately assessed based solely upon an analysis of these obligations  as the table below does not contemplate all aspects of our cash inflows  such as the level of cash flow generated by certain of our investments  nor all aspects of our cash outflows  such as income taxes 
estimated payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in millions long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations commitments to purchase or fund investments commercial mortgage loan commitments other long term liabilities insurance liabilities undistributed demutualization consideration total the estimated payments due by period for long term debt reflects the contractual maturities of principal  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  as well as estimated future interest payments 
the estimate for future interest payments includes the effect of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning our long term debt 
the estimated payments due by period for operating leases reflect the future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have no significant capital lease obligations 
we have commitments to purchase or fund investments  some of which are contingent upon events or circumstances not under our control  including those at the discretion of our counterparties 
the timing of the fulfillment of certain of these commitments cannot be estimated  therefore the settlement of these obligations are reflected in estimated payments due in less than one year 
commitments to purchase or fund investments include billion that we anticipate will be funded from the assets of our separate accounts 
loan commitments of our commercial mortgage operations  which are legally binding commitments to extend credit to a counterparty  have been reflected in the contractual obligations table above principally based on the expiration date of the commitment  however  it is possible these loan commitments could be funded prior to their expiration 
in certain circumstances the counterparty may also extend the date of the expiration in exchange for a fee 
the estimated payments due by period for insurance liabilities reflect future estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders for future policy benefits  policyholders account balances and separate account liabilities 
these future estimated cash outflows are based on mortality  morbidity  lapse and other assumptions comparable with our experience  consider future premium receipts on current polices in force  and assume market growth and interest crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs and value of business acquired 
these cash outflows are undiscounted with respect to interest and  as a result  the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of trillion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of billion included in the consolidated financial statements as of december  separate account liabilities are legally insulated from general account obligations  and it is generally expected these liabilities will be fully funded by separate account assets and their related cash flows 
we have made significant assumptions to determine the future estimated cash outflows related to the underlying policies and contracts 
due to the significance of the assumptions used  actual cash outflows will differ  possibly materially  from these estimates 
we remain obligated to disburse demutualization consideration for eligible policyholders that we have been unable to locate 
to the extent we continue to be unable to establish contact with these policyholders within a prescribed period of time specified by state escheat laws the funds must be remitted to governmental authorities 
the amounts reflected in the table above are reflective of state escheat laws as of december  these liabilities are reflected within other liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position 
excludes short term debt  which includes billion of floating rate convertible senior notes 
for additional information on our short term debt see note to the consolidated financial statements

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements guarantees in the course of our business  we provide certain guarantees and indemnities to third parties pursuant to which we may be contingently required to make payments now or in the future 
a number of guarantees provided by us relate to real estate investments  in which the investor has borrowed funds  and we have guaranteed their obligation to their lender 
in some cases  the investor is an affiliate  and in other cases the unaffiliated investor purchases the real estate investment from us 
we provide these guarantees to assist the investor in obtaining financing for the transaction on more beneficial terms 
our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was billion as of december  any payments that may become required of us under these guarantees would either first be reduced by proceeds received by the creditor on a sale of the assets  or would provide us with rights to obtain the assets 
these guarantees generally expire at various times over the next years 
as of december   no amounts were accrued as a result of our assessment that it is unlikely payments will be required 
we write credit derivatives under which we are obligated to pay the counterparty the referenced amount of the contract and receive in return the defaulted security or similar security 
our maximum amount at risk under these credit derivatives  assuming the value of the underlying securities become worthless  is billion at december  these credit derivatives generally have maturities of five years or less 
certain contracts underwritten by the retirement segment include guarantees related to financial assets owned by the guaranteed party 
these contracts are accounted for as derivatives  at fair value  in accordance with sfas no 
as of december   such contracts in force carried a total guaranteed value of billion 
we arrange for credit enhancements of certain debt instruments that provide financing for commercial real estate assets  including certain tax exempt bond financings 
the credit enhancements provide assurances to the debt holders as to the timely payment of amounts due under the debt instruments 
as of december   such enhancement arrangements total million  with remaining contractual maturities of up to years 
our obligation to reimburse required payments are secured by mortgages on the related real estate  which properties are valued at million as of december  we receive certain ongoing fees for providing these enhancement arrangements and anticipate the extinguishment of our obligation under these enhancements prior to maturity through the aggregation and transfer of our positions to a substitute enhancement provider 
as of december   we have accrued liabilities of million representing unearned fees on these arrangements 
in connection with certain acquisitions  we agreed to pay additional consideration in future periods  based upon the attainment by the acquired entity of defined operating objectives 
in accordance with gaap  we do not accrue contingent consideration obligations prior to the attainment of the objectives 
as of december   maximum potential future consideration pursuant to such arrangements  to be resolved over the following three years  is million 
any such payments would result in increases in intangible assets  including goodwill 
we are also subject to other financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements 
we have provided indemnities and guarantees related to acquisitions  dispositions  investments and other transactions that are triggered by  among other things  breaches of representations  warranties or covenants provided by us 
these obligations are typically subject to various time limitations  defined by the contract or by operation of law  such as statutes of limitation 
in some cases  the maximum potential obligation is subject to contractual limitations  while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable 
since certain of these obligations are not subject to limitations  it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount due under these guarantees 
as of december   we have accrued liabilities of million associated with all other financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements  which does not include retained liabilities associated with sold businesses 
other contingent commitments in connection with our commercial mortgage operations  we originate commercial mortgage loans 
as of december   we had outstanding commercial mortgage loan commitments with borrowers of billion 

table of contents in certain of these transactions  we prearrange that we will sell the loan to an investor after we fund the loan 
as of december   million of our commitments to originate commercial mortgage loans are subject to such arrangements 
we also have other commitments  some of which are contingent upon events or circumstances not under our control  including those at the discretion of our counterparties 
these other commitments amounted to billion as of december  reflected in these other commitments are billion of commitments to purchase or fund investments  including billion that we anticipate will be funded from the assets of our separate accounts 
other off balance sheet arrangements we do not have retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities  or variable interests in unconsolidated entities or other similar transactions  arrangements or relationships that serve as credit  liquidity or market risk support  that we believe are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or our access to or requirements for capital resources 
in addition  we do not have relationships with any unconsolidated entities that are contractually limited to narrow activities that facilitate our transfer of or access to associated assets 
deferred policy acquisition costs we capitalize costs that vary with and are related primarily to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance and annuities contracts 
the costs include commissions  costs to issue and underwrite the policies and certain variable field office expenses 
the capitalized amounts are known as deferred policy acquisition costs  or dac 
our total dac  including the impact of the unrealized investment gains and losses  amounted to billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   of our total dac related to our international insurance segment  related to our individual life segment  related to our individual annuities segment  and related to our closed block business 
if we were to experience a significant decrease in asset values or increase in lapse or surrender rates on policies for which we amortize dac based on gross margins or gross profits  such as participating and variable life insurance  we would expect acceleration of the amortization of dac for the effected blocks of policies 
additionally  for all policies on which we have outstanding dac  we would be required to evaluate whether this experience called into question our ability to recover all or a portion of the dac  and we would be required to accelerate the amortization for some or all of the dac if we concluded that we could not recover it 
an accelerated amortization of dac would negatively effect our reported earnings under generally accepted accounting principles

with respect to non variable life insurance products  fixed rate annuities  the fixed rate options in our variable life insurance and annuity products  and other finance businesses  we incur market risk primarily in the form of interest rate risk 
we manage this risk through asset liability management strategies that seek to match the interest rate sensitivity of the assets to that of the underlying liabilities 
our overall objective in these strategies is to limit the net change in value of assets and liabilities arising from interest rate movements 
while it is more difficult to measure the interest sensitivity of our insurance liabilities than that of the related assets  to the extent that we can measure such sensitivities we believe that interest rate movements will generate asset value changes that substantially offset changes in the value of the liabilities relating to the underlying products 
for variable annuities and variable life insurance products  excluding the fixed rate options in these products  mutual funds and most separate accounts  our main exposure to the market is the risk that asset based fees decrease as a result of declines in assets under management due to changes in prices of securities 
we also run the risk that asset management fees calculated by reference to performance could be lower 
for variable annuity and variable life insurance products with minimum guaranteed death benefits and variable annuity products with living benefits such as guaranteed minimum income  withdrawal  and accumulation benefits  we also face the risk that declines in the value of underlying investments as a result of changes in prices of securities may increase our net exposure to such benefits under these contracts 
as part of our risk management strategy  we hedge the living benefit features of our variable annuity contracts  with the exception of guaranteed minimum income benefits  using interest rate and equity based derivatives 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our use of interest rate and equity based derivatives 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about the guaranteed minimum death benefits associated with our variable life and variable annuity contracts  and the guaranteed minimum income  withdrawal  and accumulation benefits associated with the variable annuity contracts we issue

we manage our exposure to equity price risk relating to our general account investments primarily by seeking to match the risk profile of equity investments against risk adjusted equity market benchmarks 
we measure benchmark risk levels in terms of price volatility in relation to the market in general 
the sources of our exposure to market risk can be divided into two categories  other than trading activities conducted primarily in our insurance and annuity operations  and trading activities conducted primarily in our equity and derivatives trading operations 
as part of our management of both other than trading and trading market risks  we use a variety of risk management tools and techniques 
these include sensitivity and value at risk  or var  measures  position and other limits based on type of risk  and various hedging methods 
other than trading activities we hold the majority of our assets for other than trading activities in our segments that offer insurance and annuities products 
we incorporate asset liability management techniques and other risk management policies and limits into the process of investing our assets 
we use derivatives for hedging purposes in the asset liability management process 

table of contents insurance and annuities products asset liability management we seek to maintain interest rate and equity exposures within established ranges  which we periodically adjust based on market conditions and the design of related products sold to customers 
our risk managers establish investment risk limits for exposures to any issuer  geographic region  type of security or industry sector and oversee efforts to manage risk within policy constraints set by management and approved by the investment committee of the board of directors 
we use duration and convexity analyses to measure price sensitivity to interest rate changes 
duration measures the relative sensitivity of the fair value of a financial instrument to changes in interest rates 
convexity measures the rate of change of duration with respect to changes in interest rates 
we seek to manage our interest rate exposure by legal entity by matching the relative sensitivity of asset and liability values to interest rate changes  or controlling duration mismatch of assets and liabilities 
we have target duration mismatch constraints for each entity 
as of december  and  the difference between the pre tax duration of assets and the target duration of liabilities in our duration managed portfolios was within our constraint limits 
we consider risk based capital implications in our asset liability management strategies 
we also perform portfolio stress testing as part of our us regulatory cash flow testing for major product lines that are subject to risk from changes in interest rates 
in this testing  we evaluate the impact of altering our interest sensitive assumptions under various moderately adverse interest rate environments 
these interest sensitive assumptions relate to the timing and amount of redemptions and prepayments of fixed income securities and lapses and surrenders of insurance products and the potential impact of any guaranteed minimum interest rates 
we evaluate any shortfalls that this cash flow testing reveals to determine if we need to increase statutory reserves or adjust portfolio management strategies 
market risk related to interest rates our other than trading assets that subject us to interest rate risk include primarily fixed maturity securities  commercial loans and policy loans 
in the aggregate  the carrying value of these assets represented of our consolidated assets  other than assets that we held in separate accounts  as of december  and as of december  with respect to other than trading liabilities  we are exposed to interest rate risk through policyholder account balances relating to interest sensitive life insurance  annuity and other investment type contracts  collectively referred to as investment contracts  and through outstanding short term and long term debt 

table of contents we assess interest rate sensitivity for other than trading financial assets  financial liabilities and derivatives using hypothetical test scenarios that assume either upward or downward basis point parallel shifts in the yield curve from prevailing interest rates 
the following tables set forth the net estimated potential loss in fair value from a hypothetical basis point upward shift as of december  and  because this scenario results in the greatest net exposure to interest rate risk of the hypothetical scenarios tested at those dates 
while the test scenario is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future interest rates or the performance of fixed income markets  it is a near term  reasonably possible hypothetical change that illustrates the potential impact of such events 
these test scenarios do not measure the changes in value that could result from non parallel shifts in the yield curve  which we would expect to produce different changes in discount rates for different maturities 
as a result  the actual loss in fair value from a basis point change in interest rates could be different from that indicated by these calculations 
as of december  notional amount of derivatives fair value hypothetical fair value after basis point parallel yield curve shift hypothetical change in fair value in millions financial assets with interest rate risk fixed maturities commercial loans mortgage broker loan inventory policy loans derivatives swaps futures options forwards financial liabilities with interest rate risk short term and long term debt investment contracts bank customer liabilities net estimated potential loss as of december  notional amount of derivatives fair value hypothetical fair value after basis point parallel yield curve shift hypothetical change in fair value in millions financial assets with interest rate risk fixed maturities commercial loans mortgage broker loan inventory policy loans derivatives swaps futures options forwards financial liabilities with interest rate risk short term and long term debt investment contracts bank customer liabilities net estimated potential loss the tables above do not include approximately billion of insurance reserve and deposit liabilities as of december  and billion as of december  we believe that the interest rate sensitivities of these insurance liabilities offset  in large measure  the interest rate risk of the financial assets set forth in these tables 

table of contents our net estimated potential loss as of december  increased million from december  the estimated changes in fair values of our financial assets shown above relate primarily to assets invested to support our insurance liabilities  but do not include assets associated with products for which investment risk is borne primarily by the contractholders rather than by us 
market risk related to equity prices we actively manage investment equity price risk against benchmarks in respective markets 
we benchmark our return on equity holdings against a blend of market indices  mainly the s p and russell  and we target price sensitivities that approximate those of the benchmark indices 
we estimate our equity price risk from a hypothetical decline in equity benchmark market levels and measure this risk in terms of the decline in fair market value of equity securities we hold 
using this methodology  our estimated equity price risk as of december  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of equity securities we held at that date from billion to billion 
our estimated equity price risk using this methodology as of december  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of equity securities we held at that date from billion to billion 
in calculating these amounts  we exclude equity securities related to products for which the investment risk is borne primarily by the contractholder rather than by us 
while these scenarios are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect our expectations regarding future performance of equity markets or of our equity portfolio  they represent near term reasonably possible hypothetical changes that illustrate the potential impact of such events 
market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in our domestic general account investment portfolios  other proprietary investment portfolios and through our operations in foreign countries 
our exposure to foreign currency risk within the domestic general account investment portfolios supporting our us insurance operations and other domestic proprietary investment portfolios arises primarily from investments that are denominated in foreign currencies 
we generally hedge substantially all domestic general account foreign currency denominated fixed income investments and other domestic proprietary foreign currency investments into us dollars in order to mitigate the risk that the cash flows or fair value of these investments fluctuates as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we generally do not hedge all of the foreign currency risk of our investments in equity securities of unaffiliated foreign entities 
our operations in foreign countries create the following three additional sources of foreign currency risk first  we reflect the operating results of our foreign operations in our financial statements based on the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
we hedge some of these foreign currency operating results as part of our overall risk management strategy 
we generally hedge our anticipated exposure to adjusted operating income fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our international operations primarily in japan  korea  taiwan and europe 
second  we translate our equity investment in foreign operations into us dollars using the foreign currency exchange rate at the financial statement period end date 
for our equity investments in our international operations  other than in japan and taiwan  we generally hedge a significant portion of this exposure  which we accomplish through the use of foreign currency forward contracts 
for our equity investments in our japanese and taiwanese operations we generally hedge this exposure by holding us dollar denominated securities in the investment portfolios of these operations 

table of contents third  our international insurance operations may hold investments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of those operations on an unhedged basis in addition to the aforementioned equity hedges resulting from foreign subsidiaries investing in us dollar denominated investments 
most significantly  our japanese operations hold us dollar denominated investments in their investment portfolios in excess of our equity investment in such operations 
for a discussion of our japanese operations us dollar denominated investment holdings  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations realized investment gains and general account investments general account investments portfolio composition 
we manage our investment foreign currency exchange rate risks  described above  within specified limits 
foreign currency exchange risks for our domestic general account investment portfolio and the unhedged portion of our equity investment in foreign subsidiaries are managed using var based analysis 
this statistical technique estimates  at a specified confidence level  the potential pre tax loss in portfolio market value that could occur over an assumed time horizon due to adverse market movements 
the estimated var as of december  for foreign currency exchange risks in our domestic general account portfolio and the unhedged portion of equity investment in foreign subsidiaries  measured at a confidence level and using a one month time horizon  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of these foreign currency assets from billion to billion 
the estimated var as of december  for foreign currency exchange risks in our domestic general account portfolio and the unhedged portion of equity investment in foreign subsidiaries  measured at a confidence level and using a one month time horizon  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of these foreign currency assets from million to million 
the average var for foreign currency exchange risks in our domestic general account portfolio and the unhedged portion of equity investment in foreign subsidiaries  measured monthly at a confidence level over a one month time horizon  was million during and million during these calculations use historical price volatilities and correlation data at a confidence level 
we discuss limitations of var models below 
the estimated var for instruments used to hedge our anticipated exposure to adjusted operating income fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our international operations  measured at a confidence level and using a one month time horizon  was million as of december  and million as of december  derivatives derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  financial indices  or the prices of securities or commodities 
derivative financial instruments may be exchange traded or contracted in the over the counter market and include swaps  futures  options and forward contracts 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our derivative activities as of december  and under insurance statutes  our insurance companies may use derivative financial instruments to hedge actual or anticipated changes in their assets or liabilities  to replicate cash market instruments or for certain income generating activities 
these statutes generally prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments primarily to seek to reduce market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  as well as equity prices  and to alter interest rate or foreign currency exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities 
in addition  we use derivative financial instruments to mitigate risk associated with some of our benefit features of our variable annuity contracts 
trading activities we engage in trading activities primarily in connection with our equity and derivatives trading operations 
we maintain trading positions in various equity  foreign exchange instruments and commodities  primarily to facilitate transactions for our clients 
market risk affects the values of our trading positions through fluctuations in absolute or relative interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  securities and commodity prices 
we seek to use short security positions and forwards  futures  options and other derivatives to limit exposure to interest rate and other market risks 
we also trade derivative financial instruments that allow our clients to manage 
table of contents exposure to interest rate  currency and other market risks 
our derivative transactions involve both exchange listed and over the counter contracts and are generally short term in duration 
we act both as a broker  buying and selling exchange listed contracts for our customers  and as a dealer  by entering into futures and security transactions as a principal 
as a broker  we assume counterparty and credit risks that we seek to mitigate by using margin or other credit enhancements and by establishing trading limits and credit lines 
as a dealer  we are subject to market risk as well as counterparty and credit risk 
we manage the market risk associated with trading activities through hedging activities and formal policies  risk and position limits  counterparty and credit limits  daily position monitoring  and other forms of risk management 
value at risk var is one of the tools we use to monitor and manage our exposure to the market risk of our trading activities 
we calculate a var that encompasses our trading activities using a confidence level 
the var method incorporates the risk factors to which the market value of our trading activities is exposed  which consist of interest rates  including credit spreads  foreign currency exchange rates  equity prices and commodity prices  estimates of volatilities from historical data  the sensitivity of our trading activities to changes in those market factors and the correlations of those factors 
the total var for our trading activities  which considers our combined exposure to interest rate risk  equity price risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  and commodities price risk  expressed in terms of adverse changes to fair value at a confidence level over a one day time horizon  was million as of december  and million as of december  the largest component of this total var as of december  and was related to commodities price risk 
the total average daily var for our trading activities considering our exposure to interest rate risk  equity risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  and commodities price risk  expressed in terms of adverse changes to fair value with a confidence level over a one day time horizon  was million during and million during the largest component of both periods total average daily var was related to commodities price risk 
limitations of var models although var models are a recognized tool for risk management  they have inherent limitations  including reliance on historical data that may not be indicative of future market conditions or trading patterns 
accordingly  var models should not be viewed as a predictor of future results 
we may incur losses that could be materially in excess of the amounts indicated by the models on a particular trading day or over a period of time  and there have been instances when results have fallen outside the values generated by our var models 
a var model does not estimate the greatest possible loss 
the results of these models and analysis thereof are subject to the judgment of our risk management personnel
