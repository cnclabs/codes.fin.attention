item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  segment results of operations  and note  operating segment and geographic information  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
pain management our pain management segment provides treatment through interventional and non interventional therapies that treat both the chronic and acute pain patient 
our pain management facilities are located in eight states in the united states and one province in canada 
as of december  our pain management segment operated facilities four of which are wholly owned and of which are managed contracts 
our pain management segment provides services to patients who are in need of such services as therapeutic injections  radio frequency treatments and both physical and behavioral therapy 
pain management has emerged as a separate specialty in medicine 
methods used to treat chronic or acute pain are continually evolving 
some of the more common approaches to the treatment of pain include the following analgesics 
pharmaceutical treatments for pain include nonopioid analgesics  including nonsteriodial anti inflammatory drugs  or nsaids  such as aspirin and acetaminophen  opioid analgesics  such as morphine  and other drugs that have analgesic properties that are useful in treating pain  such as certain antiepileptic and antidepressant drugs  diagnostic injection 
injection of anesthetics and anti inflammatory agents directly into the area surrounding the pain generating nerve can relieve pain symptoms and often allow the nerve area to heal and repair itself 
these injections  often referred to as epidural or facet blocks  allow the pain specialist to identify the specific anatomic structure that is generating the pain response  implantable pumps 
implantable pain pumps are devices inserted in the patient s body that deliver a constant dose of anesthetic to a particular region of the body 
the pain specialist can alter the level of anesthetic delivered depending on patient need 
implantable pumps are often used to treat cancer pain or severe back pain  neuromodulation devices 
neuromodulation devices such as implantable stimulators or pumps are used to treat chronic pain by altering nervous system activity either electrically or pharmacologically  and radio frequency nerve ablation 
rf nerve ablation is a procedure used to temporarily deactivate minor nerves around the spine by heating surrounding tissue with a special probe to deactivate the pain generating nerve fibers 
acute and chronic pain it is estimated that million people in the united states have a chronic pain disorder according to a publication by the american pain society and  according to marketdata enterprises  million of those suffering seek treatment by pain specialists 
another million americans reported suffering from acute pain that persisted for more than hours in duration according to the american pain foundation in these studies found that the back was the source of the most pain 
as the baby boom population ages  the number of people who will require treatment for pain from back disorders  degenerative joint diseases  rheumatologic conditions  visceral diseases and cancer is expected to continue to rise 
it is estimated by the national pain foundation that the annual cost to americans suffering pain is billion each year 
the medical community s awareness of the need for pain management has increased in recent years 
both the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations jcaho and the veterans health administration have adopted pain as the th vital sign 
this initiative mandates that pain be taken seriously and assessed adequately and treated in the majority of hospitals and clinics nationwide according to the national pain foundation 
in  jcaho published standards that incorporated pain management into the standards for accredited health care providers 
the jcaho standards stress patients rights to appropriate assessment and management of pain  and require treatment of pain along with the underlying disease or disorder 
as a result  we believe that pain management is growing in significance as a medical specialty as is the increased demand for pain treatment 
clinical approaches to pain treatment the standard of care for treatment of chronic or acute pain may vary greatly depending on the underlying cause of the patient s pain 
a patient who is suffering from pain generally receives a clinical assessment  including a review of the patient s medical history  to attempt to determine the cause of the patient s pain 
diagnosis 
to assist in determining the pain s origin  the physician may employ one or more imaging modalities  such as x ray  computed tomography or ct scan  or magnetic resonance imagery or mri 
in addition  the physician may order an electrodiagnostic medical consultation  which can be helpful to establish an accurate diagnosis of a clinical problem that suggests neuromuscular disorder 
electrodiagnosis involves the placement of electrodes in proximity to the patient s nervous system  and the application of electrical pulses that stimulate nerve function 
by identifying those nerves that are generating the pain response  the physician can more accurately determine the cause of the patient s pain and determine the appropriate treatment 
orthopedic rehabilitation 
one of the most frequent causes of chronic pain is injury or disease affecting the spine 
orthopedic rehabilitation is often the first approach to the treatment of back pain and is frequently used following surgical treatment to post operatively restore the patient s muscle function 
depending on the underlying cause of the patient s back pain and its severity  the physician may recommend orthopedic rehabilitation  which may include hot and cold packs  electric stimulation or electrotherapy  massage  exercise  ultrasound therapy  and physical therapy sessions  utilizing specialized orthopedic rehabilitation equipment 
surgeries as of december  our surgery centers segment operated three managed facilities in florida  louisiana and virginia 
our surgical services offered include full spectrum orthopedic surgery  minimally invasive spine surgery and foot and ankle surgery 
minimally invasive surgery 
in contrast to traditional open surgery approaches  minimally invasive surgery techniques have been developed that require only a small incision and the use of endoscopic instruments to perform the operation 
some of the minimally invasive surgical treatments for back pain include discogram  a diagnostic procedure that involves injecting a dye into the disc of the spine  and using an x ray to determine whether the disc has been damaged  intra discal electro thermal annuloplasty or idet  which is used to treat patients with pain due to disc herniation in the lower back 
using an x ray for guidance  a small thermal catheter is inserted into the herniated disc and gradually heated  raising the temperature inside the disc 
the heat contracts and thickens the protein of the disc wall as well as deactivating many of the nerve endings responsible for the pain in the damaged disc  percutaneous discectomy  which employs a mechanical or laser based probe inserted into a herniated spinal disc  which removes material from the disc to relieve pressure and associated pain  nucleoplasty  for the treatment of pain from mildly herniated discs causing pressure on adjacent nerve roots 
using an x ray for guidance  a needle and specialized device are inserted into the herniated disc applying heat to remove the excess tissue and seal the disc  and kyphoplasty  which is used to treat vertebral compression fractures associated with osteoporosis 
again using an x ray for guidance  the bone is drilled and a balloon is inserted and inflated in the fracture area 
the space created by the balloon is filled with orthopedic cement  binding the fracture and relieving pain 
inpatient spine surgery 
if the patient does not respond to orthopedic rehabilitation  or if the extent of the disease or injury is too great  the physician may elect surgical treatment for back pain 
traditional surgical treatments for back pain include surgeries such as spinal fusion  which involves fusing one or more vertebrae together using screws  rods or grafts  anterior discectomy  which involves removal of a spinal disc  anterior corpectomy  which involves removing a portion of the entire vertebra or disc  and laminectomy  where a portion of the entire vertebra is removed to repair a disc  access the spinal cord or relieve degeneration of the spine 
these techniques are typically performed in an inpatient hospital setting and involve exposing a large area of the patient s spine 
following the operation  a long recovery period with extensive rehabilitation is typically required 
we believe that there are many advantages to minimally invasive surgery over traditional open surgery  including shorter time involved  reduced cost and faster patient recovery and return to normal activities 
ancillary services as of december  our ancillary services segment operated five managed facilities in florida  illinois  michigan and maryland 
three of our ancillary service facilities are consolidated through managed contracts and two facilities are owned on a partnership basis 
our partnership interest in both lake worth surgical center and coral gables surgical center is and  respectively 
for management reporting purposes  it should be noted that the three ambulatory surgery centers currently listed as held for sale are included in the ancillary services segment which relates to discontinued operations 
see item management discussion and analysis for further analysis 
our ancillary service segment provides the following services orthopedic rehabilitation services 
we have a program for the deployment of orthopedic rehabilitation services to the physician practice that facilitates advanced strength testing and restoration of function within the physician office environment 
as needed  we will establish an in house  fully staffed and provisioned rehabilitation clinic  with additional physiatrists  physical therapists or technicians as practice requirements dictate 
we provide all supplies and equipment necessary for the operation of the clinic including state of the art medx equipment 
medx equipment has been clinically and academically demonstrated to be efficacious in rehabilitating patients 
we believe that by providing orthopedic rehabilitation services in house  the physician is better able to monitor the patient s progress toward recovery  which contributes to improved clinical outcomes 
electrodiagnostic services 
we also have a program for the deployment of an electrodiagnostic medicine program as a direct extension of the neurologic portion of the physical examination 
we provide electrodiagnostic equipment  supplies  and technicians to perform procedures  and arrange for physician over read and review of results 
we believe that by performing these procedures in house  we have the potential to enhance accuracy and time to diagnosis 
diagnostic imagery 
we deploy magnetic resonance imagery  or mri  technology to selected facilities 
we believe that providing diagnostic imagery technology to pain management practices will be more convenient for patients and allow physicians to better diagnose and treat acute and chronic pain 
intra articular joint program 
in january  we unveiled a new proprietary ancillary service designed to address severe knee pain and stiffness caused by osteoarthritis  which currently affects over million americans 
the intra articular joint program will be integrated into the service offerings provided by each suitable physician practice in our national healthcare organization 
in addition  the intra articular joint program will be marketed nationally to non affiliated physician practice groups under a limited management agreement  similar to our proprietary orthopedic rehabilitation and electro diagnostic medicine programs 
the intra articular joint program is a proprietary  technologically advanced  non operative knee treatment protocol that combines a five to six week series of strategically targeted injections of hyalgan the first fda approved hyaluronan therapy to treat osteoarthritis knee pain in the united states  with synergist ic orthopedic rehabilitation procedures specifically designed to strengthen blood flow to the knee 
corporate and other corporate and other includes only cost functions that are managed directly from our corporate office and that do not fall within one of our three operating segments discussed above 
all corporate costs and related overhead are contained within this segment 
these costs  include such expenses as accounting  communications  compliance  human resources  information technology  internal audit  and legal and provide support functions to our operating segments 
recent developments acquisitions since our founding in  we have completed twenty four practice acquisitions 
the following acquisitions all managed unless indicated otherwise have been completed since january  effective date of name and nature of business purchase purchase price center for pain management asc  llc  a fully accredited ambulatory surgical center with four locations in maryland 
january   in cash and  shares of common stock  plus promissory notes totaling  in principal  due one year from the closing date 
on december   an additional  promissory note was issued and the due date of both the  and  promissory notes was extended until april  rec  inc carefirst medical associates  pa  co located pain management and orthopedic rehabilitation practices located in whitehouse  texas 
january   in cash and  shares of paincare s common stock  plus contingent payments of up to  in cash and common stock if certain performance goals are met 
desert pain medicine group  a pain management physician practice with three locations in california

amphora  llc  an intraoperative monitoring company based in denver  colorado  serving medical institutions throughout colorado  wyoming  arizona and nebraska february  paincare purchased a ownership interest and paid  in cash and  shares of paincare s common stock  plus contingent payments of up to  in cash and common stock if certain performance goals are met 
this transaction was rescinded on december  on november   paincare formed a new wholly owned subsidiary named integrated pain solutions ips 
leveraging paincare s centralized and specialized knowledge base of advanced pain diagnostics  interventional pain management and functional restoration procedures and solutions  ips will develop  administer and track the outcome of proprietary  evidenced based  clinical pathways for the management of acute or chronic pain 
this clinical criteria will serve as the basis for the delivery of quality care by highly credentialed  multi disciplined provider networks contracted and managed by ips in select us markets 
upon establishing each regionalized provider network  ips will contract with third party payers  including insurance carriers  self insured employers and large trade unions  among other similar groups  to provide utilization management services  specialized case management and prospective and concurrent risk assessment of patients requiring pain related care and treatment 
further  ips will endeavor to ultimately establish pain centers of excellence in its primary service markets where it will centralize care addressing interventional pain management  functional restoration and behavioral health 
paincare expects to launch commercial operations of ips late in the first quarter of  following the necessary corporate set up and development efforts required to activate the first provider network 
dispositions on february   the company and paincare neuromonitoring i  inc pcn  and together with the company the paincare parties acquired a interest the amphora transaction in amphora llc amphora from bruce lockwood  md  john d 
bender  md  and richard a 
flores collectively the members pursuant to the terms of a membership interest purchase agreement the amphora purchase agreement  for a combination of cash and shares of common stock of the company and the obligation to make certain additional payments post closing the purchase price 
the paincare parties and the members have entered into an agreement providing for the rescission of the amphora transaction the rescission agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the rescission agreement i the amphora purchase agreement was rescinded  ii the members paid the paincare parties a sum of  and returned to the paincare parties  shares of common stock of the company  iii the company delivered to the members a noncompetition agreement  and iv the parties entered into mutual releases 
the description of the rescission agreement set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by the specific terms of the rescission agreement 
on october   paincare holdings  inc the paincare  paincare acquisition company xxi  inc the paincare sub  and together with paincare the paincare parties  christopher j 
centeno  md  md the original practice  therapeutic management  inc tmi  christopher j 
centeno  md centeno  john schultz  md schultz  and centeno schultz  inc csi  and together with the original practice  centeno  schultz and tmi  the centeno parties  effected a transaction the purchase transaction by which i the paincare parties acquired substantially all of the assets of the original practice  pursuant to that certain asset purchase agreement  by and among the paincare parties  centeno  schultz and csi  ii the paincare parties acquired substantially all of the assets tmi pursuant to that certain asset purchase agreement  by and among the paincare parties  tmi and centeno  and iii csi and the paincare sub entered into that certain management services agreement the management agreement pursuant to which the paincare sub managed the business operations of csi 
on february   the paincare parties and the centeno parties entered into a settlement agreement the settlement agreement and several ancillary documents the settlement transaction pursuant to which said parties rescinded the purchase transaction and terminated agreements among them 
to effectuate the rescission of the purchase transaction  i the paincare sub sold  and the original practice purchased  substantially all of the assets of the paincare sub for purchase price of the lesser of  or the total amount of proceeds generated from the sale certain shares of common stock of paincare the paincare shares issued to the centeno parties in the purchase transaction  and ii in exchange for the agreement of the paincare parties to terminate the management agreement and any and all other agreements between csi and the paincare parties  csi paid the paincare parties  plus all remaining proceeds in excess of  from the sale of the pa incare shares 
with the intention of narrowing our core business strategy and to reduce debt obligations  paincare s management decided during that the ambulatory surgery centers no longer fit the company s acquisition model  and committed to a plan to sell the asc s 
paincare s ambulatory surgery centers  which are consolidated through the ancillary services segment  are classified as held for sale and measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the operations and cash flows of these asc s will be eliminated from ongoing operations as a result of the sale transaction  and paincare anticipates that it will have no continuing involvement in the operations of the product group after it is sold 
therefore paincare is reporting the results of operations of the component  including any gain or loss  in discontinued operations  as per the requirements of fasb statement no 
accounting for the impa irment or disposal of long lived assets 
competition pain management our pain management and rehabilitation facilities face competition from large privately and publicly held companies such as health south  and us physical therapy  inc we expect competition to increase  particularly in the market for rehabilitation services  as consolidation of the therapy industry continues through acquisitions by hospitals and large health care companies of physician owned and other privately owned therapy practices 
some of these competitors may have greater referral support and financial resources in particular markets than we do 
we believe we compete successfully within the marketplace based on our size  reputation for quality and positive rehabilitation outcomes 
surgery centers we face competition from other providers of ambulatory surgical care in developing asc joint ventures  acquiring existing centers  attracting patients  and negotiating managed care contracts in each of our markets 
there are several publicly held companies  divisions or subsidiaries of publicly held companies  and several private companies that operate asc s 
further  many physician groups develop asc s without a corporate partner  utilizing consultants who typically perform these services for a fee who may not require an equity interest in the ongoing operations of the center 
we believe that we compete effectively in this market but no longer feel that surgery center facilities are a part of our core business model 
on a forward looking basis  we do not plan to pursue any acquisitions with asc service providers 
ancillary services the market for ancillary services is highly fragmented and competitive 
many physicians and physician groups have opened up offices that offer ancillary services 
our ancillary services also compete with local hospitals  rehabilitation centers and local independent companies 
regulatory environment general our practices are subject to substantial federal  state and local government health care laws and regulations 
in addition  laws and regulations are constantly changing and may impose additional requirements 
these changes could have the effect of impeding our ability to continue to do business or reduce our opportunities to continue to grow 
every state imposes licensing requirements on individual physicians and health care facilities 
in addition  federal and state laws regulate hmos and other managed care organizations 
many states require regulatory approval  including certificates of need  before establishing certain types of health care facilities  including surgery centers  or offering certain services 
many states in which we do business have corporate practice of medicine laws which prohibit us from owning practices or exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of physicians 
these laws and their interpretations vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities  each with broad discretion 
in those states  we acquire the non medical assets of these practices and enter into long term management agreements with these managed practices and with respect to our limited management practices  we enter into shorter term limited management agreements 
under those agreements  we provide management services and other items to the practices in exchange for a service fee 
we structure our relationships with the practices in a manner that we believe keeps us from engaging in the corporate practice of medicine or exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of the practices or their physicians 
never theless  state regulatory authorities or other parties could assert that our agreements violate these laws 
the laws of many states prohibit physicians from splitting fees with non physicians or other physicians 
these laws vary from state to state and are enforced by the courts and by regulatory authorities with broad discretion 
the relationship between us on the one hand  and the managed practices and limited management practices  on the other hand  may raise issues in some states with fee splitting prohibitions 
although we have attempted to structure our contracts with the managed practices and the limited management practices in a manner that keeps us from violating prohibitions on fee splitting  state regulatory authorities or other parties may assert that we are engaged in practices that constitute fee splitting 
this would have a material adverse effect on us 
medicare and medicaid participation a substantial portion of our revenues are expected to continue to be received through third party reimbursement programs  including state and federal programs  primarily medicare as well as medicaid  and private health insurance programs 
medicare is a federally funded and administered health insurance program  primarily for individuals entitled to social security benefits who are or older or who are disabled 
medicaid is a health insurance program jointly funded by state and federal governments that provides medical assistance to qualifying low income persons 
to participate in the medicare program and receive medicare payment  the owned practices  managed practices and limited management practices must comply with regulations promulgated by the department of health and human services 
the requirements for certification under medicare and medicaid are subject to change and  in order to remain qualified for these programs  the practices may have to make changes from time to time in equipment  personnel or services 
although we believe these practices will continue to participate in these reimbursement programs  we cannot assure you that these practices will continue to qualify for participation 
medicare fraud and abuse the anti kickback provisions of the social security act the anti kickback statute prohibit anyone from knowingly and willfully a soliciting or receiving any remuneration in return for referrals for items and services reimbursable under most federal health care programs  or b offering or paying any remuneration to induce a person to make referrals for items and services reimbursable under most federal health care programs 
the prohibited remuneration may be paid directly or indirectly  overtly or covertly  in cash or in kind 
violation of the anti kickback statute is a felony  and criminal conviction results in a fine of not more than  imprisonment for not more than five years  or both 
further  the secretary of the department of health and human services has the authority to exclude violators from all federal health care programs and or impose civil monetary penalties of  for each violation and assess damages of not more than three times the total amount of remuneration offered  paid  solicited or received 
as the result of a congressional mandate  the office of the inspector general oig of the department of health and human services promulgated regulations specifying certain payment practices which the oig determined to be at minimal risk for abuse 
the oig named these payment practices safe harbors 
if a payment arrangement fits within a safe harbor  it will be deemed not to violate the anti kickback statute 
merely because a payment arrangement does not comply with all of the elements of any safe harbor  however  does not mean that the parties to the payment arrangement are violating the anti kickback statute 
we receive fees under our agreements with the managed practices and the limited management practices for management and administrative services and equipment and supplies 
we do not believe we are in a position to make or influence referrals of patients or services reimbursed under medicare  medicaid or other governmental programs 
because the provisions of the anti kickback statute are broadly worded and have been broadly interpreted by federal courts  however  it is possible that the government could take the position that we  as a result of our ownership of the owned practices  and as a result of our relationships with the limited management practices and the managed practices  will be subject  directly and indirectly  to the anti kickback statute 
with respect to the managed practices and the limited management practices  we provide general management services and limited management services  respectively 
in return for those services  we receive compensation 
the oig has concluded that  depending on the facts of each particular arrangement  management arrangements may be subject to the anti kickback statute 
in particular  an advisory opinion published by the oig in concluded that in a proposed management services arrangement where a management company was required to negotiate managed care contracts on behalf of the practice  the proposed arrangement could constitute prohibited remuneration where the management company would be reimbursed its costs and paid a percentage of net practice revenues 
our management agreements with the managed practices and the limited management practices differ from the management agreement analyzed in advisory opinion significantly  we believe we are not in a position to generate referrals for the managed practices or the limited management practices 
in fact  our management agreements do not require us to negotiate managed care contracts on behalf of the managed practices or the limited management practices  or to provide marketing  advertising  public relation services or practice expansion services to those practices 
because we do not undertake to generate referrals for the managed practices or the limited management practices  and the services provided to these practices differ in scope from those provided under advisory opinion  we believe that our management agreements with the managed practices and limited management practices do not violate the anti kickback statute 
nevertheless  although we believe we have structured our management agreements in such a manner as not to violate the anti kickback statute  we cannot guarantee that a regulator would not conclude that the compensation to us under the management agreements constitutes prohibited remuneration 
in such event  our operations would be materially adversely affected 
the relationship between the physicians employed by the owned practices and the owned practices is subject to the anti kickback statute as well because the employed physicians refer medicare patients to the owned practices and the employed physicians receive compensation from the owned practices for services rendered on behalf of the owned practices 
nevertheless  there is a safe harbor for compensation paid pursuant to a bona fide employment relationship 
therefore  it is our position that the owned practices arrangements with their respective employed physicians do not violate the anti kickback statute 
nevertheless  if the relationship between the owned practices and their physician employees is determined not to be a bona fide employment relationship  this could have a material adverse effect on us 
our agreements with the limited management practices may also raise different anti kickback concerns 
in april of  the oig issued a special advisory bulletin which addressed contractual joint ventures where a health care provider in one line of business owner expands into a related health care business by contracting with an existing provider of a related item or service manager to provide the new item or service to the owner s existing patient population 
in those arrangements  the manager not only manages the new line of business  but may also supply it with inventory  employees  space  billing and other services 
in other words  the owner contracts out substantially the entire operation of the related line of business to the manager  receiving in return the profits of the business as remuneration for its federal program referrals to the new line of business 
according to the oig  contractual joint ventures have the following characteristics i the establishment of a new line of business  ii a captive referral base  iii the owner lacks business risk  iv the manager is a competitor or would be competitor of the owner s new line of business  v the scope of services provided by the manager is extremely broad  with the manager providing day to day management  billing  equipment  personnel  office space  training  health care items  supplies and services  vi the practical effect of the arrangement is to enable the owner to bill insurers and patients for business otherwise provided by the manager  vii the parties agree to a non compete clause barring the owner from providing items or services to any patient other than those coming from owner and or barring the manager from providing services in its own right to the owner s patients 
we have attempted to draft our agreements with the limited management practices in a manner that takes into account the concerns in the special advisory bulletin 
specifically  under our arrangements  the limited management practice takes business risk 
it is financially responsible for the following costs the space required to provide the services  employment costs of the personnel providing the services and intake personnel  and billing and collections 
we do not reimburse the limited management practice for any of these costs 
we provide solely equipment  supplies and our management expertise 
in one of our limited management business lines we do not even provide the equipment 
in return for these items and services  we receive a percentage of the limited management practice s collections from the services being managed by us that is consistent with the fair market value of our services 
consequently  we believe that the limited management practice is not being compensated for or to induce its referrals 
although we believe that our arrangements with the limited management practices do not violate the anti kickback statute for the reasons specified above  we cannot guarantee that our arrangements will be free from scrutiny by the oig or that the oig would not conclude that these arrangements violate the anti kickback statute 
in a recent oig advisory opinion no 
 the oig declined to issue a favorable opinion on a limited lease management arrangement involving physician office based pathology laboratory services 
although we believe that our limited management arrangements are distinguishable from the facts in advisory opinion no 
 this opinion illustrates how broadly the oig is applying its contractual joint venture analysis 
in the event the oig were to conclude that our limited management arrangements violate the anti kickback statute  this would have a material adverse effect on us 
federal anti referral laws section of title of the social security act  commonly referred to as the stark law  prohibits a physician from making a referral to an entity for the furnishing of medicare covered designated health services if the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a financial relationship with that entity 
designated health services include clinical laboratory services  physical and occupational therapy services  radiology services  including magnetic resonance imaging  computerized axial tomography scans  and ultrasound services including the professional component of such diagnostic testing  but excluding invasive procedures where the imaging modality is used to guide a needle  probe or catheter accurately  radiation therapy services and supplies  durable medical equipment and supplies  home health services  inpatient and outpatient hospital services  and certain other services 
a financial relationship is defined as an ownership or investment interest in or a compensation arrangement with an entity that provides designated health services 
sanctions for prohibited referrals include denial of medicare payment  and civil money penalties of up to  for each service ordered 
designated health services furnished pursuant to a referral that is prohibited by the stark law are not covered by medicare and payments improperly collected must be promptly refunded 
the physicians in our owned practices have a financial relationship with the owned practices they receive compensation for services rendered and may refer patients to the owned practices for physical and occupational therapy services and perhaps other designated health services covered by medicare 
therefore  an exception would have to apply to allow the physicians in our owned practices to refer patients to the owned practices for the provision by the owned practices of medicare covered designated health services 
there are several exceptions to the prohibition on referrals for designated health services which have the effect of allowing a physician that has a financial relationship with an entity to make referrals to that entity for the provision of medicare covered designated health services 
the exception on which we rely with respect to the owned practices is the exception for employees  as all of the physicians employed in our owned practices are employees of the respective owned practices 
therefore  we believe that the physicians employed by our owned practices can refer patients to the owned practices for the provision of designated health services covered by medicare 
nevertheless  should the owned practices fail to adhere to the conditions of the employment exception  or if a regulator determines that the employees or the employment relationship do not meet the criteria of the employment exception  the owned practices would be liable for violating the stark law  and that could have a material adverse effect on us 
we believe that our relationships with the managed practices and the limited management practices  respectively  do not trigger the stark law 
nevertheless  if a regulator were somehow to determine that these relationships are subject to the stark law  and that the relationships do not meet the conditions of any exception to the stark law  such failure would have a material adverse effect on us 
the referral of medicare patients by physicians employed by or under contract with the managed practices and the limited management practices  respectively  to their respective practices  however  does trigger the stark law 
we believe  nevertheless  that the in office ancillary exception to the stark law has the effect of permitting these physician members of the respective managed practices and limited management practices to refer patients to their respective group practice for the provision by the respective group practice of medicare covered designated health services 
if the managed practices or limited management practices fail to abide by the terms of the in office ancillary exception  they cannot properly bill medicare for the designated health services provided by them 
in such an event  our business could be materially adversely affected because the revenues we generate from these practices is dependent  at least in part  on the revenues or profits generated by those practices 
state anti referral laws at least some of the states in which we do business also have prohibitions on physician self referrals that are similar to the stark law 
these laws and interpretations vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities  each with broad discretion 
as indicated elsewhere  we enter into management agreements with the managed practices and the limited management practices 
under those agreements  we provide management and equipment and services to the practices in exchange for compensation 
although we believe that the practices comply with these laws  and although we attempt to structure our relationships with these practices in a manner that we believe keeps us from violating these laws or in a manner that we believe does not trigger the law  state regulatory authorities or other parties could assert that the practices violate these laws and or that our agreements with the practices violate these laws 
any such concl usion could adversely affect our financial results and operations 
a substantial portion of our business operations  including our corporate offices  are located in florida 
florida s prohibition on self referrals  fla 
stat 
self referral act  prohibits health care providers from referring patients  regardless of payment source not just medicare and medicaid beneficiaries  for the provision of certain designated health services florida designated health services to an entity in which the health care provider is an investor or has an investment interest 
under the self referral act  florida designated health services are defined as clinical laboratory  physical therapy  and comprehensive rehabilitative  diagnostic imaging and radiation therapy services 
we currently operate facilities  and plan to purchase additional practices that provide some or all of these florida designated health services 
all health care products and services not considered florida designated hea lth services are classified as other health services 
the self referral act also prohibits the referral by a physician of a patient for other health services to an entity in which that physician is an investor  unless i the physician s investment interest is in the registered securities of a publicly traded corporation whose shares are traded on a national exchange or over the counter market and which has net equity at the end of its most recent fiscal quarter in excess of  or ii the physician s investment interest is in an entity whereby a no more than of the value of the investment interests in the entity may be held by investors who are in a position to make referrals to the entity  b the terms under which an investment interest is offered must be the same for referring investors and non referring investors  c the terms under which an investment interest is offered may not be related to the investor s volume of referrals to the entity  and d the investor must not be required to make referrals or be in the position to make referrals to the entity as a condition for becoming or remaining an investor the investor exception 
entities that meet either exception must also i not lend to or guarantee a loan to an investor who is in a position to make referrals if the investor uses any part of that loan to obtain the investment interest  and ii distribute profits and losses to investors in a manner that is directly proportional to their capital investment 
the self referral act excludes from the definition of referral services by a health care provider who is a sole provider or member of a group practice as defined by the self referral act that are provided solely for the referring health care provider s or group practice s own patients group practice exception 
referrals by our physician investors who are not employed by an owned practice to an owned practice for other health services should qualify for the investor exception  because physician investors in a position to refer to our owned practice  but who are not employed by our owned practice  do not collectively own more than of the investment value of paincare 
however  physician investors who are not employed by our owned practices cannot refer to our owned practices for florida designated health services because they are not members of our owned group practices and  thus  their referrals would not qualify for the group practice exception 
so long as physician investors who are not employed by our owned practices do not refer to our owned practices for florida designated health services  we believe we will be in compliance with the self referral act 
although we will have mechanisms in place to monitor referrals from physician investors  it is the responsibility of the physician investors to comply with the self referral act and there can be no assurances that physician investors will comply with such law 
violations thereof could adversely affect us  as well as result in regulatory action against the company 
the self referral act also imposes certain disclosure obligations on us and physician investors who are referring physicians 
under the self referral act  a physician may not refer a patient to an entity in which he or she is an investor  even for services that are not florida designated health services  unless  before doing so  the patient is given a written statement disclosing  among other things  the physician s investment interest in the entity to which the referral is made 
other obligations are imposed on the company as a result of the self referral act 
it is the responsibility of any referring physician investor to comply with such statutes  regulations and professional standards 
however  this law may discourage certain physician investors from making referrals to us or encourage patients to choose alternative health care providers 
in addition  the violation thereof could adversely affect us  as well as result in regulatory action again st us 
violations of the florida self referral laws may result in substantial civil penalties and administrative sanctions for individuals or entities as well as the suspension or revocation of a physician s license to practice medicine in florida 
such sanctions  if applied to us or any of our physician investors  would result in significant loss of reimbursement and could have a material adverse effect on us 
florida also has a criminal prohibition regarding the offering  soliciting  or receiving of remuneration  directly or indirectly  in cash or in kind  in exchange for the referral of patients the patient brokering act 
one of the exceptions to this prohibition is for business and compensation arrangements that do not violate the anti kickback statute 
accordingly  so long as we are in compliance with the anti kickback statute  then the arrangement should be in compliance with the patient brokering act 
information privacy regulations numerous state  federal and international laws and regulations govern the collection  dissemination  use and confidentiality of patient identifiable health information  including the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of and related rules  or hipaa 
in the provision of services to our patients  we may collect  use  maintain and transmit patient information in ways that may or will be subject to many of these laws and regulations 
the three rules that were promulgated pursuant to hipaa that could most significantly affect our business are the standards for electronic transactions  or transactions rule  the standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information  or privacy rule  and the health insurance reform security standards  or security rule 
the respective compliance dates for these rules for most entities were october   april  and april  hipaa applies to covered entities  which include most healthcare providers and health plans that will contract for the use of our services 
hipaa requires covered entities to bind contractors to compliance with certain burdensome hipaa requirements 
other federal and state laws restricting the use and protecting the privacy of patient information also apply to us  either directly or indirectly 
the hipaa transactions rule establishes format and data content standards for eight of the most common healthcare transactions 
when we perform billing and collection services for our owned practices or managed practices we may be engaging in one of more of these standard transactions and will be required to conduct those transactions in compliance with the required standards 
the hipaa privacy rule restricts the use and disclosure of patient information and requires entities to safeguard that information and to provide certain rights to individuals with respect to that information 
the hipaa security rule establishes elaborate requirements for safeguarding patient information transmitted or stored electronically 
we may be required to make costly system purchases and modifications to comply with the hipaa requirements that are imposed on us and our failure to comply with these requirements may result in liability and may adversely affect our business 
federal and state consumer protection laws are being applied increasingly by the federal trade commission  or ftc  and state attorneys general to regulate the collection  use and disclosure of personal or patient information  through websites or otherwise  and to regulate the presentation of website content 
courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the ftc  which concern consumer notice  choice  security and access 
numerous other federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of private information 
these laws in many cases are not preempted by hipaa and may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies  creating complex compliance issues for us and potentially exposing us to additional expenses  adverse publicity and liability 
other countries also have  or are developing  laws governing the collection  use and transmission of personal or patient information and these laws  if applicable  could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business 
new health information standards  whether implemented pursuant to hipaa  congressional action or otherwise  could have a significant effect on the manner in which we must handle health care related data  and the cost of complying with these standards could be significant 
if we do not properly comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to patient health information  we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions

item a 
risk factors our business  operations  and financial condition are subject to various risks 
some of these risks are described below  and you should take such risks into account in evaluating paincare or any investment decision involving paincare 
this section does not describe all risks that may be applicable to our company  our industry  or our business  and it is intended only as a summary of certain material risk factors 
more detailed information concerning the risk factors described below is contained in other sections of this annual report 
risks related to our business the company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the execution of our restructuring plan bkhm  pa  our independent registered public accounting firm  has included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements for the fiscal year ended december   which expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to the defaults on our hbk and cpmasc promissory notes and convertible debentures 
the inclusion of a going concern explanatory paragraph in bkhm  pa s report on our financial statements could have a detrimental effect on our stock price and our ability to raise additional capital 
our financial statements have been prepared on the basis of a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
we have not made any adjustments to the financial statements as a result of the outcome of the uncertainty described above 
accordingly  the value of the company in liquidation may be different from the amounts set forth in our financial statements 
our continued success will depend on our ability to continue to raise capital in order to fund the development and commercialization of our products 
failure to raise additional capital may result in substantial adverse circumstances  including delisting of our common stock shares from the american stock exchange  which could substantially decrease the liquidity and value of such shares  or ultimately result in our liquidation 
the company plans to sell three surgery centers to raise funds for the purpose of restructuring our debt obligations 
the proceeds would be used to either pay in full or a substantial portion of the million of debt with hbk investments  lp also  the funds would be used to pay the amount due under the promissory note to the original sellers of the center for pain management ambulatory surgery center cpmasc of approximately million 
the objective is to substantially reduce the debt outstanding by using the proceeds of the sale of the surgery center division 
there may be an additional amount raised through the issuance of common stock or convertible debentures 
these proceeds would primarily be used for working capital needs 
the company would have a significantly reduced debt load if the plan is executed 
the company s working capital needs for are primarily for contingent cash payments of up to million for the acquisitions as the earnings requirements are met 
the company is expected to receive a total of approximately million as a tax refund during the third or fourth quarter of the refund will be used for working capital needs 
restatement of consolidated financial statements 
on january  we received notification from the us securities and exchange commission that there was no further comment on the restatement of our form k filings for december  and december  prior to the completion of the sec s review of our filings  we received comments from the sec staff regarding our method of accounting for i certain term notes  freestanding and embedded derivatives  and ii intangible assets acquired in connection with physician practice and surgery center acquisitions 
in connection with the sec review  we restated our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   december   december   december   december  and the quarters ended march   june  and september  we also restated the quarters ended march   june  and september  for our accounting of the intial adoption of fas r  share based pay ment 
a number of class action lawsuits have been filed against us and certain of our officers and directors 
we have become aware of eleven putative class action lawsuits and one derivative action filed against us and certain of our officers and directors 
the lawsuits arose in connection with our determination to restate certain of our historical financial statements 
we believe that the lawsuits lack merit and we have engaged the international law firm of mcdermott will emery llp to vigorously defend against such allegations and claims 
there can be no assurance at this time how the lawsuits in question will ultimately be resolved  or the impact  if any  such resolutions will have on our operations and or financial condition 
we have received a notice of default from our lenders 
on may   june   august   and november   we entered into letter agreements the waiver letters with hbk investments lp the agent  hbk master fund lp  hbk mf and del mar master fund ltd 
del mar  and together with hbk mf the lenders pursuant to which the agent and the lenders waived certain of our breaches of the terms of the loan and security agreement entered into by the parties on may   as amended the loan agreement 
in consideration of the entry by the agent and the lenders into the waiver letters  we paid fees to the lenders in the amount of    and  respectively 
the august   waiver letter required us to cause the financial covenants in section of the loan agreement to be amended on or before october   in a manner satisfactory to the agent and the lenders 
on october   we entered into a letter agreement with the agent and the lenders extending the october  deadline until november  on november   we entered into a letter agreement with the agent and the lenders extending the november  deadline until december  on january   we entered into a forbearance agreement the forbearance agreement with the agent and the lenders pursuant to which the agent and the lenders agreed to forbear  until a date not later than march   from exercising their rights and remedies under the loan agreement with respect to certain specified events of default under the loan agreement that had either occurred or that were thought to likely occur during the forbearance period 
in consideration for the forbearance  we agreed to certain additional covenants and to pay fees in the amount of i  at closing  plus  ii upon the repayment in full of our obligations under the loan agreement the obligations  an amount equal to the greater of i  and ii  for each month or portion thereof that has elapsed after the date of the forbearance agreement before the obligations have been repaid in full 
since our entry into the forbearance agreement we have failed to comply with certain covenants set forth in the forbearance agreement  and may have additionally violated certain terms and provisions set forth in the loan agreement 
on march   we received a notice of default from the agent setting forth certain alleged events of default by us under the loan agreement  including  but not limited to  a failure by us to make certain required payments 
the notice of default further provides i the default rate of interest as set forth in the loan agreement is in effect until such time as all such alleged events of default have either been cured or waived in writing  and ii the agent and lenders expressly reserve all of their remedies  powers  rights  and privileges under the loan agreement  at law  in equity  or otherwise including  without limitation  the right to declare all obligations under the loan agreement immediately due and payable 
shou ld the agent take additional actions to enforce its rights under the loan agreement our business and operations could be materially adversely affected 
on march   we received a notice of breach and default the cpm notice from the center for pain management  llc cpm with respect to that certain asset acquisition agreement dated december  the apa entered into by us  paincare acquisition company xv  inc the subsidiary  cpm  and the owners of cpm the members 
the cpm notice set forth our failure to make certain installment payments of cash and common stock under the terms of the apa 
the cpm notice further provides that unless we cure the alleged events of default set forth in the cpm notice  i certain non competition and non solicitation provisions binding the members will cease as of april   and ii cpm and the members will have  as of april   certain rights under that certain stock pledge agreement dated december  the pledge agreement entered into by us and the members  including  but not limited to  the right to foreclose on the issued and outstanding shares of stock of the subsidiary 
any actions by cpm or the members to enforce their rights under the apa and pledge agreement may trigger certain defaults under our senior credit facility with hbk  which could materially adversely affect our business and operations 
pursuant to the terms of the agreements under which we acquired certain of our practices we may be required to make payments in the amount of approximately million within the first six months of further  our convertible debentures and our secured convertible term notes contain certain provisions and restrictions  which if violated  could result in the full principal amount   as of december   together with interest and other amounts  becoming immediately due and payable in cash 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the lenders under our senior secured credit facility will not exercise certain rights they may have thereunder that might result in us having to make substantial payments to them to induce them to enter into additional forbearance agreements 
we need to continue to improve and implement our controls and procedures 
requirements adopted by the sec in response to the passage of the sarbanes oxley act of require us to i evaluate and report on a quarterly basis the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures  and ii assess and report on an annual basis the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
during our assessment with respect to the effectiveness of the foregoing controls as of december   the end of our most recent fiscal year  management identified a number of material weaknesses  which are fully disclosed in item a in this form k 
as a result of the material weaknesses  management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting as of december   the end of our most recent fiscal year  were not effective 
in an effort to rectify the foregoing material weaknesses  we have modified our method of accounting for certain transactions and have impl emented additional controls 
in so doing  we restated our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   december   december   december   december  and the quarters ended march   june  and september  we continue to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting  and may modify  enhance or supplement them as appropriate in the future 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with all of the sec control requirements 
any modifications  enhancements or supplements to our controls systems could be costly to prepare or implement  divert the attention of our management from operating our business  and cause our operating expenses to increase over the ensuing year 
further  our stock price may be adversely affected by the current  or any future  determination that our disclosure controls and procedures and or internal controls over financial reporting were not effective 
please refer to item a below for an additional discussion regarding our controls 
if we are unable to complete the disposition of our interests in our ambulatory surgery centers and or enter into one or more financing transactions  we may not have enough cash to fund our operations 
while we are currently in the process of divesting our interests in our ambulatory surgery centers and are actively negotiating with a number of institutional investors over potential financings  there can be no guarantee that we will be able to effectuate either on terms we deem suitable 
to the extent we are able to obtain financing and or divest our interests in the ambulatory surgery centers we anticipate using a substantial percentage of the proceeds therefrom to reduce our debt obligations and satisfy our payment obligations to our acquired practices 
any financing transaction in which we enter will likely result in a significant ownership dilution to our existing stockholders  on a fully diluted basis  as a result of the current market price for our common stock 
in the event we are unable to accomplish either the divestiture of our ambulatory surgery centers or the closing of additional rounds of financing  we may not have sufficient cash to fund our operations in the short term  which could result in  among other adverse consequences  our default under our senior credit facility  convertible debentures  and secured convertible term notes  and other obligations 
the success of our growth strategy depends on the successful identification  completion and integration of acquisitions 
we have acquired or entered into general management agreements with physician practices and nine ambulatory surgery centers since and we intend to pursue additional acquisitions and management relationships 
our future success will depend on our ability to identify and complete acquisitions as well as integrate the acquired businesses with our existing operations 
more recently  we have developed managed care initiatives through provisions of utilization management  case management  care coaching  and a provider network 
there are inherent risks associated with expanding our product services line such as the inability to contract with physicians at a reduced treatment rate for each regional area as well as having the ability to convince insurance providers to reduce the rate of co payment 

we are entering into a new paradigm of managed care which will require additional demands on our infrastructure in order to become a key competitor within this facet of the health care industry 
our growth strategy will result in significant additional demands on our infrastructure  and will place a significant strain on our management  administrative  operational  financial and technical resources  and increase demands on our systems and controls 
our growth strategy involves numerous risks  including  but not limited to the possibility that we are not able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms  possible decreases in capital resources or dilution to existing stockholders  difficulties and expenses incurred in connection with an acquisition  the difficulties of operating an acquired business  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  a limited ability to predict future operating results of acquired practices  and the potential loss of key physicians  employees and patients of an acquired practice 
in the event that the operations of an acquired practice do not meet expectations  we may be required to restructure the acquired practice or write off the value of some or all of the assets of the acquired practice 
we cannot assure you that any acquisition will be successfully integrated into our operations or will have the intended financial or strategic results 
in addition  acquisitions entail an inherent risk that we could become subject to contingent or other liabilities in connection with the acquisitions  including liabilities arising from events or conduct pre dating our acquisition and that were not known to us at the time of acquisition 
although we conduct due diligence in connection with each of our acquisitions  this does not mean that we will necessarily identify all potential problems or issues in connection with any given acquisition  some of which could be significant 
our failure to successfully identify and complete future acquisitions or to integrate and successfully manage completed acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our growth strategy may not prove viable and expected growth and value may not be realized 
our strategy is to rapidly grow by acquiring  establishing and managing a network of pain management  minimally invasive spine surgery and orthopedic rehabilitation centers 
identifying appropriate physician groups and proposing  negotiating and implementing economically attractive affiliations with them can be a lengthy  complex and costly process 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying and establishing relationships with orthopedic surgery and pain management groups 
if we are successful in implementing our strategy of rapid growth  such growth may impair our ability to efficiently provide non professional support services  facilities  equipment  non professional personnel  supplies and non professional support staff to medical practices 
our future financial results could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage growth effectively 
there can be no assurance that physicians  medical providers or the medical community in general will accept our business strategy and adopt the strategy offered by us 
the extent to which  and rate at which  these services achieve market acceptance and penetration will depend on many variables including  but not limited to  the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the clinical safety  efficacy and cost effectiveness of these services  the advantage of these services over existing technology  and third party reimbursement practices 
there can be no assurance that the medical community and third party payors will accept our technology 
similar risks will confront any other services developed by us in the future 
failure of our services to gain market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
integrated pain solutions is the nation s first and foremost pain focused managed services organization 
our services address the entire continuum of care for persons with acute and chronic pain conditions by offering a comprehensive  integrated array of products 
there can be no assurance that the products we offer to pain suffering patients will prove to be a viable source to their healthcare needs 
there can be no assurance that the medical community and third party payors will accept our business strategy 
our operations have not been profitable in recent periods 
for the years ended december   and  net loss was   and  respectively 
there is potential of this trend to continue into the future as the company reduces its emphasis on acquisitions  divests interest in its ambulatory surgery centers  and focuses its efforts on organic growth and the ips initiative 
a significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other intangible assets and any impairment  reduction  or elimination of these intangible assets could hurt our results of continuing operations 
as of december   we had other intangible assets and net goodwill for continuing operations  of approximately million  which constituted of our total consolidated assets 
the net goodwill reflects the amount we pay for our acquired practices in excess of the fair value of other identifiable intangible and tangible assets 
our net goodwill will increase in the future as a result of our acquisitions as we pay the contingent purchase price for the acquisitions according to the terms of the respective purchase agreements 
in addition  we expect to acquire additional goodwill in connection with future acquisitions 
as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles  we do not amortize goodwill  rather it is carried on our balance sheet until it is impaired 
although goodwill is not amortized  the other intangible asset  which is the physician referral network  is amortized over seven years 
in addition  both goodwill and other inta ngibles are tested annually for impairment 
any determination of impairment could require a significant reduction  or the elimination  of goodwill  which could hurt our results of operations 
such impairment charges were identified and recorded in in the total amount of million 
also  the effect of a prolonged downturn in our business will be exacerbated by the impairment  and resulting write down  of goodwill related to a reduction in the value of our acquired practices 
our cash flow and financial condition may be adversely affected by the assumption of credit risks 
our managed and limited management practices bill their patients insurance carriers for services provided by the practices 
by undertaking the responsibility for patient billing and collection activities  the practices assume the credit risk presented by the patient base  as well as the risk of payment delays attendant to reimbursement through governmental programs or third party payors 
if our practices are unsuccessful in collecting a substantial amount of such fees  it will have a material adverse affect on our financial condition because our compensation from these practices is dependent on the practices collections 
during the second half of  we performed an analysis of our historical cash collections and adjusted the current collection percentages on several practices 
this resulted in a million write off of net receivables 
we rely on the services of our physicians 
we may not be able to attract and retain qualified physicians we need to support our business 
our operations are substantially dependent on the services of our practices physicians 
with respect to our owned practices  we have employment agreements with our physicians that generally have terms of five years  but may be terminated by either party in certain circumstances 
our management agreements with our managed practices generally have a year term  while our agreements with limited management practices have a five year term with options for two additional five year renewal terms which are exercisable at our election 
these agreements may be earlier terminated under certain circumstances 
although we will endeavor to maintain and renew such contracts  in the event a significant number of physicians terminate their relationships with us  our business could be adversely affected 
while our employment and management agreements contain covenants not to compete with us for a period of generally two years after termination of employment  th ese provisions may not be enforceable 
we compete with many types of health care providers and government institutions for the services of qualified physicians 
if we are unable to attract and retain physicians  our revenues will decrease and our business will suffer 
if certain key employees were to leave  we may be unable to operate our business profitably  complete existing projects or undertake certain new projects 
our key employees and consultants include merrill reuter  md  randy lubinsky  mark szporka  and ron riewold 
we have entered into employment agreements with randy lubinsky chief executive officer and director  ron riewold president and director  mark szporka chief financial officer and director  and dr 
merrill reuter president of one of our subsidiaries and chairman of the board 
should the services of dr 
reuter  randy lubinsky  ron riewold  or mark szporka or other key personnel become unavailable to us for any reason  our business could be adversely affected 
there is no assurance that we will be able to retain these key individuals and or attract new employees of the caliber needed to achieve our objectives 
we do not maintain any key employee life insurance policies 
our employment agreements with certain senior executive officers entitle them to individual annual bonuses equal to a minimum of  up to a maximum of of salary 
our employment agreements with our chief executive officer  chief financial officer and president  which expire on december   and were amended effective january   entitle each officer to a minimum annual bonus of  up to a maximum of of their base salary in any one calendar year 
increased costs associated with corporate governance compliance may significantly affect our results of operations 
the sarbanes oxley act of and our being subject to the securities exchange act of  as amended  requires changes in some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure and compliance practices  and requires a review of our internal control procedures 
we expect these developments to increase our legal compliance and financial reporting costs 
in addition  they could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  or qualified executive officers 
finally  director and officer liability insurance for public companies has become more difficult and more expensive to obtain  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur higher costs to obtain coverage that is satisfactory to us and our officers or directors 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude or additional costs we may incur as a result 
changes associated with reimbursement by third party payors for our services may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
our revenues are directly dependent on the acceptance of the services provided by our managed practices and limited management practices as covered benefits under third party payor programs  including ppos  hmos and other managed care entities 
the health care industry is undergoing significant changes  with third party payors taking measures to reduce reimbursement rates or  in some cases  denying reimbursement for previously acceptable treatment modalities 
there is no assurance that third party payors will continue to pay for the services provided by our owned practices under their payor programs or by the managed practices 
failure of third party payors to adequately cover minimally invasive surgery or other services will have a material adverse effect on us 
professional liability claims could adversely impact our business 
our managed practices are involved in the delivery of health care services to the public and are exposed to the risk of professional liability claims 
claims of this nature  if successful  could result in damage awards to the claimants in excess of the limits of any applicable insurance coverage 
insurance against losses related to claims of this type can be expensive and varies widely from state to state 
there can be no assurance that our owned and managed practices will not be subject to such claims  that any claim will be successfully defended or  if our practices are found liable  that the claim will not exceed the limits of our insurance 
liabilities in excess of our insurance could have a material adverse effect on us 
our business is subject to substantial competition which could have a material impact on our business and financial condition 
the health care industry  in general  and the markets for orthopedic  rehabilitation and minimally invasive surgery services in particular  are highly competitive 
the practices we own or manage compete with other physicians and rehabilitation clinics who may be better established or have greater recognition in a particular community than the physicians in these practices 
these practices also compete against hospitals and large health care companies  such as healthsouth  inc and us physical therapy  inc  with respect to orthopedic and rehabilitation services  and symbion and amsurg corp  with respect to outpatient surgery centers 
these hospitals and companies have established operating histories and greater financial resources than us 
in addition  we expect competition to increase  particularly in the market for rehabilitation services  as consolidation of the physical therapy industry continues through the acquisition by hospitals and large health care companies of physician owned and other privately owned physical therapy practices 
we will also compete with our competitors in connection with acquisition opportunities 
failure to obtain managed care contracts and legislative changes could adversely affect our business 
there can be no assurance that our owned or managed practices will be able to obtain managed care contracts 
these practices future inability to obtain managed care contracts in their markets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operation 
in addition  federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced that could substantially increase the number of medicare and medicaid recipients enrolled in hmos and other managed care plans 
we derive  through these practices  a substantial portion of our revenue from medicare and medicaid 
in the event such proposals are adopted  there can be no assurance that these practices will be able to obtain contracts from hmos and other managed care plans serving medicare and medicaid enrollees 
failure to obtain such contracts could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations 
even if our practices are able to enter into managed care contracts  the terms of such agreements may not be favorable to us 
risks related to our industry the health care industry is highly regulated and our failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us or the owned practices  and the failure of the managed practices and the limited management practices to comply with laws and regulations applicable to them  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our owned practices  the managed practices and the limited management practices are subject to stringent federal  state and local government health care laws and regulations 
if we or they fail to comply with applicable laws  or if a determination is made that in the past we or the managed practices or the limited management practices have failed to comply with these laws  we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties  including the loss of our license or our physicians licenses to operate and our ability to participate in medicare  medicaid and other government sponsored and third party health care programs 
in addition  laws and regulations are constantly changing and may impose additional requirements 
these changes could have the effect of impeding our ability to continue to do business or reduce our opportunities to continue to grow 
periodic revisions to laws and regulations may reduce the revenues generated by the owned practices  managed practices and the limited management practices 
a significant amount of the revenues generated by our owned practices  the managed practices and the limited management practices is derived from governmental payors 
these governmental payors have taken and may continue to take steps designed to reduce the cost of medical care 
private payors often follow the lead of governmental payors  and private payors have been taking steps to reduce the cost to them of medical care 
a change in the makeup of the patient mix that results in a decrease in patients covered by private insurance or a shift by private payors to other payment structures could also adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if reductions in reimbursement occur  the revenues generated by the owned practices  the managed practices and the limited management practices could shrink 
this shrinkage would cause a reduction in our revenues 
accordingly  our business could be adversely affected by reductions i n or limitations on reimbursement amounts for medical services rendered  payor mix changes or shifts by payors to different payment structures 
because government sponsored payors generally pay providers based on a fee schedule  and the trend is for private payors to do the same  we may not be able to prevent a decrease in our revenues by increasing the amounts the owned practices charge for services 
the same applies to the limited management practices and the managed practices 
they cannot increase their charges in an attempt to counteract reductions in reimbursement for services 
there can be no assurance that any reduced operating margins could be recouped through cost reductions  increased volume  and introduction of additional procedures or otherwise 
we believe that trends in cost containment in the health care industry will continue to result in reductions from historical levels of per patient revenue 
federal and state healthcare reform may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
federal and state governments have continued to focus significant attention on health care reform 
a broad range of health care reform measures have been introduced in congress and in state legislatures 
it is not clear at this time what proposals  if any  will be adopted  or  if adopted  what effect  if any  such proposals would have on our business 
currently proposed federal and state legislation could have an adverse effect on our business 
our affiliated physicians may not appropriately record or document services they provide 
our affiliated physicians are responsible for assigning reimbursement codes and maintaining sufficient supporting documentation for the services they provide 
the owned practices  managed practices and limited management practices use this information to seek reimbursement for their services from third party payors 
if these physicians do not appropriately code or document their services  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
unfavorable changes or conditions could occur in the geographic areas where our operations are concentrated 
a majority of our revenue in was generated by our operations in five states 
adverse changes or conditions affecting these particular markets  such as health care reforms  changes in laws and regulations  reduced medicaid reimbursements and government investigations  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
regulatory authorities could assert that the owned practices  the managed practices or the limited management practices fail to comply with the federal stark law 
if such a claim were successfully asserted  this would result in the inability of these practices to bill for services rendered  which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we could be required to restructure or terminate our arrangements with these practices 
this result  or our inability to successfully restructure the arrangements to comply with the stark law  could jeopardize our business 
section of title of the social security act  commonly referred to as the stark law  prohibits a physician from making a referral to an entity for the furnishing of medicare covered designated health services if the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a financial relationship with that entity 
designated health services include clinical laboratory services  physical and occupational therapy services  radiology services  including magnetic resonance imaging  computerized axial tomography scans  and ultrasound services including the professional component of such diagnostic testing  but excluding procedures where the imaging modality is used to guide a needle  probe or catheter accurately  radiation therapy services and supplies  durable medical equipment and supplies  home health services  inpatient and outpatient hospital services  and others 
a financial relationship is defined as an ownership or investment interest in or a compensation arrangement with an entity that provides designated health services 
sanctions for prohibited referrals include denial of medicare payment and civil monetary penalties of up to  for each service ordered 
designated health services furnished pursuant to a referral that is prohibited by the stark law are not covered by medicare and payments improperly collected must be promptly refunded 
the physicians in our owned practices have a financial relationship with the owned practices they receive compensation for services rendered and may refer patients to the owned practices for physical and occupational therapy services and perhaps other designated health services covered by medicare 
therefore  an exception would have to apply to allow the physicians in our owned practices to refer patients to the owned practices for the provision by the owned practices of medicare covered designated health services 
there are several exceptions to the prohibition on referrals for designated health services which have the effect of allowing a physician that has a financial relationship with an entity to make referrals to that entity for the provision of medicare covered designated health services 
the exception on which we rely with respect to the owned practices is the exception for employees  as all of the physicians employed in our owned practices are w employees of the respective owned practices 
therefore  we believe that the physicians employed by our owned practices can refer patients to the owned practices for the provision of designated health services covered by medicare 
nevertheless  should the owned practices fail to adhere to the conditions of the employment exception  or if a regulator determines that the employees or the employment relationship do not meet the criteria of the employment exception  the owned practices would be liable for violating the stark law  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we believe that our relationships with the managed practices and the limited management practices  respectively  do not trigger the stark law 
nevertheless  if a regulator were somehow to determine that these relationships are subject to the stark law  and that the relationships do not meet the conditions of any exception to the stark law  such failure would have a material adverse effect on us 
the referral of medicare patients by physicians employed by or under contract with the managed practices and the limited management practices  respectively  to their respective practices  however  does trigger the stark law 
we believe  nevertheless  that the in office ancillary exception to the stark law has the effect of permitting these physician members of the respective managed practices and limited management practices to refer patients to their respective group practice for the provision by the respective group practice of medicare covered designated health services 
if the managed practices or limited management practices were found not to comply with the terms of the in office ancillary exception  they cannot properly bill medicare for the designated health services provided by them 
in such an event  our business could be materially adversely affected because the revenues we generate from these practices are dependent  at least in part  on the revenues or profits generated by those practices 
regulatory authorities could assert that our owned practices  the managed practices or the limited management practices  or the contractual arrangements between us and the managed practices or the limited management practices  fail to comply with state laws analogous to the stark law 
in such event  we could be subject to civil penalties and could be required to restructure or terminate the contractual arrangements 
at least some of the states in which we do business also have prohibitions on physician self referrals that are similar to the stark law 
these laws and interpretations vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities  each with broad discretion 
as indicated elsewhere  we enter into management agreements with the managed practices and the limited management practices 
under those agreements  we provide management and other items and services to the practices in exchange for compensation 
although we believe that the practices comply with these laws  and although we attempt to structure our relationships with these practices in a manner that we believe keeps us from violating these laws or in a manner that we believe does not trigger the law  state regulatory authorities or other parties could assert that the practices violate these laws and or that our agreements with the practices violate these laws 
any such conclusion could adversely affect our financial results and operations 
regulatory authorities or other persons could assert that our relationships with our owned practices  the managed practices or the limited management practices fail to comply with the anti kickback law 
if such a claim were successfully asserted  we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and could be required to restructure or terminate the applicable contractual arrangements 
if we were subject to penalties or are unable to successfully restructure the relationships to comply with the anti kickback statute it would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the anti kickback provisions of the social security act prohibit anyone from knowingly and willfully a soliciting or receiving any remuneration in return for referrals for items and services reimbursable under most federal health care programs  or b offering or paying any remuneration to induce a person to make referrals for items and services reimbursable under most federal health care programs  which we refer to as the anti kickback statute or anti kickback law 
the prohibited remuneration may be paid directly or indirectly  overtly or covertly  in cash or in kind 
violation of the anti kickback statute is a felony and criminal conviction results in a fine of not more than  imprisonment for not more than five years  or both 
further  the secretary of the department of health and human services dhhs has the authority to exclude violators from all federal health care programs and or impose civil monetary penalties of  for each violation and assess damages of not more than three times the total amount of remuneration offered  paid  solicited or received 
as the result of a congressional mandate  the office of the inspector general oig of dhhs promulgated a regulation specifying certain payment practices which the oig determined to be at minimal risk for abuse 
the oig named these payment practices safe harbors 
if a payment arrangement fits within a safe harbor  it will be deemed not to violate the anti kickback statute 
merely because a payment arrangement does not comply with all of the elements of any safe harbor  however  does not mean that the parties to the payment arrangement are violating the anti kickback statute 
we receive fees under our agreements with the managed practices and the limited management practices for management and administrative services and equipment and supplies 
we do not believe we are in a position to make or influence referrals of patients or services reimbursed under medicare  medicaid or other governmental programs 
because the provisions of the anti kickback statute are broadly worded and have been broadly interpreted by federal courts  however  it is possible that the government could take the position that we  as a result of our ownership of the owned practices  and as a result of our relationships with the limited management practices and the managed practices  will be subject  directly and indirectly  to the anti kickback statute 
with respect to the managed practices and the limited management practices  we contract with the managed practices to provide general management services and limited management services  respectively 
in return for those services  we receive compensation 
the oig has concluded that  depending on the facts of each particular arrangement  management arrangements may be subject to the anti kickback statute 
in particular  an advisory opinion published by the oig in concluded that in a proposed management services arrangement where a management company was required to negotiate managed care contracts on behalf of the practice  the proposed arrangement could constitute prohibited remuneration where the management company would be reimbursed for its costs and paid a percentage of net practice revenues 
our management agreements with the managed practices and the limited management practices differ from the management agreement analyzed in advisory opinion significantly  we believe we are not in a position to generate referrals for the managed practices or the limited management practices 
in fact  our management agreements do not require us to negotiate managed care contracts on behalf of the managed practices or the limited management practices  or to provide marketing  advertising  public relation services or practice expansion services to those practices 
because we do not undertake to generate referrals for the managed practices or the limited management practices  and the services provided to these practices differ in scope from those provided under advisory opinion  we believe that our management agreements with the managed practices and limited management practices do not violate the anti kickback statute 
nevertheless  although we believe we have structured our management agreements in such a manner as not to violate the anti kickback statute  we cannot guarantee that a regulator would not conclude that the compensation to us under the management agreements constitutes prohibited remuneration 
in such an event  our operations would be materially adversely affected 
the relationship between the physicians employed by the owned practices and the owned practices is subject to the anti kickback statute as well because the employed physicians refer medicare patients to the owned practices and the employed physicians receive compensation from the owned practices for services rendered on behalf of the owned practices 
nevertheless  we have tried to structure our arrangements with our physician employees to meet the employment safe harbor 
therefore  it is our position that the owned practices arrangements with their respective employed physicians do not violate the anti kickback statute 
nevertheless  if the relationship between the owned practices and their physician employees is determined not to be a bona fide employment relationship  this could have a material adverse effect on us 
our agreements with the limited management practices may also raise different anti kickback concerns  but we believe that our arrangements are sufficiently different from those deemed suspect by the oig so as not to violate the law 
in april of  the oig issued a special advisory bulletin where the oig addressed contractual arrangements where a health care provider in one line of business owner expands into a related health care business by contracting with an existing provider of a related item or service manager to provide the new item or service to the owner s existing patient population 
in those arrangements  the manager not only manages the new line of business  but may also supply it with inventory  employees  space  billing and other services 
in other words  the owner contracts out substantially the entire operation of the related line of business to the manager  receiving in return the profits of the business as remuneration for its federal program referrals to the manager 
according to the oig  contractual joint ventures have the following characteristics i the establishment of a new line of business  ii a captive referral base  iii the owner lacks business risk  iv the manager is a would be competitor of the owner s new line of business  v the scope of services provided by the manager is extremely broad  with the manager providing day to day management  billing  equipment  personnel  office space  training  health care items  supplies and services  vi the practical effect of the arrangement is to enable the owner to bill insurers and patients for business otherwise provided by the manager  vii the parties agree to a non compete clause barring the owner from providing items or services to any patient other than those coming from the owner and or barring the manager from providing services in its own right to the owner s patients 
we have attempted to draft our agreements with the limited management practices in a manner that takes into account the concerns in the special advisory bulletin 
specifically  under our arrangements  the limited management practice takes business risk 
it is financially responsible for the following costs the space required to provide the services  employment costs of the personnel providing the services and intake personnel  and billing and collections 
we do not reimburse the limited management practice for any of these costs 
we provide solely equipment  supplies and our management expertise 
in return for these items and services  we receive a percentage of the limited management practice s collections from the services being managed by us 
consequently  we believe that the limited management practice is not being compensated for its referrals 
although we believe that our arrangements with the limited management practices do not violate the anti kickback statute for the reasons specified above  we cannot guarantee that our arrangements will be free from scrutiny by the oig or that the oig would not conclude that these arrangements violate the anti kickback statute 
in the event the oig were to conclude that these arrangements violate the anti kickback statute  this would have a material adverse effect on us 
state regulatory authorities or other parties may assert that we are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine 
if such a claim were successfully asserted  we could be subject to civil  and perhaps criminal  penalties and could be required to restructure or terminate the applicable contractual arrangements 
this result  or our inability to successfully restructure our relationships to comply with these statutes  could jeopardize our business and results of operations 
many states in which we do business have corporate practice of medicine laws which prohibit us from exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of physicians 
these laws and their interpretations vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities  each with broad discretion 
we enter into management agreements with managed practices and limited management practices 
under those agreements  we provide management and other items and services to the practices in exchange for a service fee 
we structure our relationships with the practices in a manner that we believe keeps us from engaging in the corporate practice of medicine or exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of the practices or their physicians 
nevertheless  state regulatory authorities or other parties could assert that our agreements violate these laws 
regulatory authorities or others may assert that our agreements with limited management practices or managed practices  or our owned practices  violate state fee splitting laws 
if such a claim were successfully asserted  we could be subject to civil and perhaps criminal penalties  and could be required to restructure or terminate the applicable contractual arrangements 
this result  or our inability to successfully restructure our relationships to comply with these statutes  could jeopardize our business and results of operations 
the laws of many states prohibit physicians from splitting fees with non physicians or other physicians 
these laws vary from state to state and are enforced by the courts and by regulatory authorities with broad discretion 
the relationship between us on the one hand  and the managed practices and limited management practices  on the other hand  may raise issues in some states with fee splitting prohibitions 
although we have attempted to structure our contracts with the managed practices and the limited management practices in a manner that keeps us from violating prohibitions on fee splitting  state regulatory authorities or other parties may assert that we are engaged in practices that constitute fee splitting  which would have a material adverse effect on us 
our use and disclosure of patient information is subject to privacy regulations 
numerous state  federal and international laws and regulations govern the collection  dissemination  use and confidentiality of patient identifiable health information  including the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of and related rules  or hipaa 
in the provision of services to our patients  we may collect  use  maintain and transmit patient information in ways that may or will be subject to many of these laws and regulations 
the three rules that were promulgated pursuant to hipaa that could most significantly affect our business are the standards for electronic transactions  or transactions rule  the standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information  or privacy rule  and the health insurance reform security standards  or security rule 
the respective compliance dates for these rules for most entities were october   april  and april  hipaa applies to covered entities  which include most health care providers that will contract for the use of our services 
hipaa requires covered entities to bind contractors to comply with certain burdensome hipaa requirements 
other federal and state laws restricting the use and protecting the privacy of patient information also apply to us  either directly or indirectly 
the hipaa transactions rule establishes format and data content standards for eight of the most common health care transactions 
when we perform billing and collection services for our owned practices or managed practices we may be engaging in one or more of these standard transactions and will be required to conduct those transactions in compliance with the required standards 
the hipaa privacy rule restricts the use and disclosure of patient information  requires covered entities to safeguard that information and to provide certain rights to individuals with respect to that information 
the hipaa security rule establishes elaborate requirements for safeguarding patient information transmitted or stored electronically 
we may be required to make costly system purchases and modifications to comply with the hipaa requirements that are imposed on us and our failure to comply may result in liability and adversely affect our business 
federal and state consumer protection laws are being applied increasingly by the federal trade commission  or ftc  and state attorneys general  to regulate the collection  use and disclosure of personal or patient information  through websites or otherwise  and to regulate the presentation of website content 
courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the ftc  which concern consumer notice  choice  security and access 
numerous other federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of private information 
these laws in many cases are not preempted by hipaa and may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies  creating complex compliance issues for us and potentially exposing us to additional expense  adverse publicity and liability 
other countries also have  or are developing  laws governing the collection  use and transmission of personal or patient information and  if applicable  these laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business 
new health information standards  whether implemented pursuant to hipaa  congressional action or otherwise  could have a significant effect on the manner in which we must handle health care related data  and the cost of complying with these standards could be significant 
if we do not properly comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to patient health information  we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions 
risks related to our common stock because we use our common stock as consideration for our acquisitions  your interest in our company will be significantly diluted 
in addition  if the investors in our recent financings convert their debentures and notes  or if we elect to pay principal and or interest on the debentures and notes with shares of our common stock or anti dilution rights in these securities are triggered  our existing stockholders will experience significant dilution 
we have used  and we expect in the future to use  our common stock as consideration for our acquisitions 
in addition  a significant amount of our acquisitions purchase price is contingent upon future performance 
we expect to issue a significant amount of our common stock to pay contingent purchase prices for previous acquisitions 
in addition  because the value of the stock we issue as payment of contingent consideration is not fixed  to the extent our stock price decreases  our existing stockholders interest in our company will be even more diluted by the payment of contingent consideration 
to the extent that our outstanding debentures and notes are converted  a significantly greater number of shares of our common stock will be outstanding and the interests of our existing stockholders will be substantially diluted 
in addition  if we complete a financing at a price per share that is less than the conversion price of our debentures and notes  the conversion price of our debentures and notes will be reduced to the financing price 
we cannot predict whether or how many additional shares of our common stock will become issuable as a result of these provisions 
hence  such amounts could be substantial 
additionally  we may elect to make payments of principal and interest on the debentures and the notes in shares of our common stock  which could result in increased downward pressure on our stock price and further dilution to our existing stockholders 
future sales of our common stock in the public market  including sales by our stockholders with significant holdings  may depress our stock price 
most of our outstanding shares of common stock are freely tradable 
in  we filed registration statements registering the resale of  shares  which includes shares issuable upon conversion of convertible notes and debentures  upon exercise of options and warrants and shares that are issuable pursuant to the earnout provisions of various business acquisitions 
the market price of our common stock could drop due to sales of a large number of shares or the perception that such sales could occur  including sales or perceived sales by our directors  officers or principal stockholders 
these factors also could make it more difficult to raise funds through future offerings of common stock 
there is a limited market for our common stock and the market price of our common stock has been volatile 
there is a limited market for our common stock 
there can be no assurance that an active trading market for the common stock will be developed or maintained 
historically  the market prices for securities of companies like us have been highly volatile 
in fact  since january   our common stock price has ranged from a low of to a high of as determined on a reverse split basis 
the market price of the shares could continue to be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors and events  including the liquidity of the market for the shares  announcements of potential business acquisitions  and changes in general market conditions 
we do not expect to pay dividends 
any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our results of operations  financial condition  capital requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors 
the board of directors is not expected to declare dividends or make any other distributions in the foreseeable future  but instead intends to retain earnings  if any  for use in business operations 
in addition  the securities purchase agreement for our convertible notes contains restrictions on the payment of dividends 
accordingly  investors should not rely on the payment of dividends in considering an investment in our company 
provisions of florida law and our charter documents may hinder a change of control and therefore depress the price of our common stock 
our articles of incorporation  our bylaws and florida law contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of us by various means such as a tender offer or merger not approved by our board of directors 
these provisions may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control or an unsolicited acquisition proposal that a stockholder might consider favorable  including a proposal that might result in the payment of a premium over the market price for the shares held by stockholders 
these provisions may also entrench our management by making it more difficult for a potential acquirer to replace or remove our management or board of directors

mr 
cope alleges that the directors breached their fiduciary duties by failing to supervise and manage the operations of the company  among other claims 
this litigation is referred to as the derivative action 
on march   and may   two purported shareholders of the company made separate demands on the company s board of directors 
these demands raised many if not all of the same issues as the derivative action  but asked the independent directors to investigate the charges and to take legal actions against those individuals responsible 
in accordance with governing florida law  the company formed a special committee of independent directors tom crane  jay rosen and aldo berti to review and investigate the two derivative demands and the allegations of the derivative complaint  to oversee settlement discussions and to make recommendations concerning the handling of the demands and the complaints to the full board of directors 
to assist with this charge  the special committee retained the law firm of morris  nichols  arsht tunnell 
in november of  the company and the plaintiff in the derivative action entered into a stipulation and agreement of compromise  settlement and release  filed on november   and conditioned upon court approval 
concurrently with the filing of the foregoing agreement  the parties jointly moved from preliminary court approval  and thereafter  for final approval following notice to the company s shareholders 
on january   the court preliminary approved the stipulation and agreement and set a hearing on april   for final approval 
further  the company has received demands from dr 
wright  the centeno group  and the amphora group related to alleged misrepresentations 
with regard to these demands  no demand for monetary damages has been made nor has litigation been commenced  and the demands have since been resolved

executive overview the year has been marked by profound turmoil 
during this period  a significant portion of our time and attention has been devoted to matters primarily outside the ordinary course of business such as responding to sec comment letters regarding our prior year accounting for certain derivative instruments  restating our prior six years of accounting records and responding to various class action suits against our company for the accounting of certain derivative instruments 
we have also devoted significant resources to improving fundamental business systems including our corporate governance functions  financial controls  and operational infrastructure 
despite these difficulties  our board of directors  senior management team  and employees worked diligently throughout and made significant progress in addressing many of the significant obstacles created during we responded to all comment letters received from the us securities and exchange commission sec and subsequently received formal notification from the sec indicating that it had completed its review and has no further comment at this time 
we completed the restatement of our accounting records and filed amended annual reports on form k a for the fiscal year ended december  the company has been faced with derivative and class action lawsuits related to financial restatements 
the derivative lawsuit is set for final approval on april  the company believes resolution of all remaining litigation is imminent 
we have begun initiatives to centralize certain accounting functions in an effort to reduce costs and mitigate material weakness 
we have implemented an aggressive marketing program to help establish a paincare brand name 
we recruited seven physicians and nine physician assistants over the past year to increase facility productivity and efficiency 
while we have been primarily focused on responding to the pressing challenges  our business  and the health care market in general  have continued to evolve 
on the positive side  health care sector growth continues to outpace the economy in response to an aging us population 
in addition  the delivery of health care services is migrating to outpatient environments  which suits our core business model 
on the other hand  health care providers are beginning to see price cut pressures brought on by medicare reform initiatives leading to reduced payments to various health care providers  such as our company 
as a whole  our core business remains sound 
we continue to face operational challenges  but we believe our accomplishments in have positioned us to capitalize on our competencies and move forward with implementing our strategic growth plan 
our business our business is currently divided into four primary operating segments pain management  surgery centers  ancillary services  and a fourth segment that manages corporate functions 
these four segments correspond to our four reporting segments discussed later in this item and throughout this annual report 
pain management 
as of december  our pain management segment operates through subsidiaries and comprises the majority of our net operating revenues 
our pain management segment provides such services as interventional and non interventional therapies that treat both the chronic and acute pain patient 
treatments include therapeutic injections  radiofrequency treatments  and physical and behavioral therapy 
from to  our pain management segment s revenues more than doubled  dominating our portfolio and remaining the very center of our company s core business model 
we have begun to orchestrate various cost cutting initiatives within this segment to further increase the operational performance of these practices 
surgeries 
as of december  our surgeries segment operates through three subsidiaries providing minimally invasive surgical procedures 
our surgical services include full spectrum orthopedic surgery  minimally invasive spine surgery and foot and ankle surgery 
from through net operating revenues and operating income remain relatively flat due in large part to only completing one surgical center acquisition and minimal same practice organic growth within this segment over the last two years 
we have begun to orchestrate various cost cutting initiatives within this segment to further increase the operational performance of these practices 
ancillary services 
as of december  our ancillary services segment operates through five subsidiaries and is our second largest revenue generating segment 
this segment offers such services as an intra articular joint program  physical therapy  nerve conduction testing and pharmacy dispensing 
from to ancillary services saw a stable growth rate due in large part to highly profitable acquisitions added during these two years 
however  our three ambulatory surgical centers asc s within this segment are currently listed as held for sale 
upon the sale of the asc locations  our ancillary services segment performance could be materially affected 
we have begun to orchestrate various cost cutting initiatives within this segment to further increase the operational performance of these practices 
the following tables illustrate the net operating revenues and consolidated adjusted ebitda as defined in this item  consolidated results of operations  from our three primary operating segments and our corporate segment

revenues by segment consolidated adjusted ebitda by segment vs vs vs vs vs vs pain management pain management ancillary services ancillary services surgeries surgeries other other we believe that the aging of the us population  changes in technology  and the continuing growth in health care spending will increase demand for the types of services we provide 
we plan to prioritize investment of time and capital based on where realistic growth prospects are strongest  which we currently believe are our pain management and ancillary service segments 
key challenges although our business is continuing to generate revenues  and market factors appear to favor our pain management and ancillary service business models  we still have several immediate internal and external challenges to overcome before we can realize significant improvements in our business  including operational improvements 
we are in the process of improving our operational efficiency within all segments 
this includes streamlining our operational structure  implementing standardized accounting procedures  and ensuring high quality patient care 
we also strive to reduce operational variation across all segments 
continuing litigation 
we are party to class action lawsuits which will require considerable management attention and company resources until settlements are reached 
price pressure 
we are seeing downward pressure on prices in our markets  from both commercial and government payors 
we anticipate continuing price pressure in all our segments 
for example  medicare has frozen asc pricing through  and beginning in  the deficit reduction act of will cap asc and imaging service payments at hospital outpatient department reimbursement levels 
other pricing changes may have a negative impact on our operating results 
divesture of assets 
we are in the process of locating willing and able buyers for our three ambulatory surgical centers currently listed as held for sale 
medical reimbursement rates 
congress and some state legislatures have proposed significant changes in the health care system 
many of these changes have the potential to result in limitations on and  in some cases  significant reductions in the levels of  reimbursement rates to health care providers for services under many government reimbursement programs 
restatement and sarbanes oxley related costs 
we paid approximately million in in connection with the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december     and  and internal controls over financial reporting 
we anticipate incurring additional related costs in the future  although we expect these costs to decline over time 
strategic plan although management s attention recently has been focused on a range of tactical issues relating to paincare s success  our senior management team has spent time developing a comprehensive strategic plan that is focused on paincare s future  not its past 
the plan  which has been approved by our board of directors  is divided into the following three phases operations management 
in an effort to enhance our operational structure and strengthen our core business strategy  the company has set forth several initiatives to solidify our financial foundation 
such initiatives involve centralizing certain accounting functions in order to reduce overhead  re syndicate the proposed sale of our ambulatory surgical centers asc s in an effort to attract potential buyers  and pay down existing debt facilities upon the sales of the asc s 
organic growth 
in order to grow currently owned physician practices  the company intends to enhance the capacity of the practices for organic growth by increasing the range of services offered 
by deploying additional physicians and equipment  practices can perform necessary procedures and services in house that would ordinarily be referred to other providers  resulting in higher quality care and increased revenues 
an example of organic growth would be to deploy imaging modalities such as mobile mri equipment  or additional services such as in office pharmaceutical dispensing 
acquisition strategy 
paincare has grown its business through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions of complimentary physician practices 
through an extensive  multi point due diligence evaluation process that the company performs prior to acquisition  including such criteria as clinical quality  physician reputation  profitability and procedure and revenue growth rates  paincare intends to acquire practices that the company believes to be well established with the capacity for future profitability and organic growth 
we are in the first phase of our strategic plan and we are already making significant strides 
we have turned certain accounting functions into a centralized procedure  thus reducing the reliance on the assistance of outside accounting firms in construction of certain subsidiary financial statements 
we have also retained the bloom organization  llc bloom to sell our interests in three of our ambulatory surgical centers 
each ambulatory surgical center is marketed separately and bloom believes that these transactions can be completed by the end of the second quarter of we believe our strategic plan capitalizes on our strengths  market direction  and legitimate growth opportunities 
we are implementing a realistic operations plan and creating the appropriate infrastructure  organization policies  protocols  systems  and reports to support it 
finally  we are setting priorities based on resources and with our long range goals of quality  profitability  and stockholder value 
consolidated results of operations we are a health care services company focused on the treatment of pain 
we provide services through a national network of pain management  surgery centers  ancillary service  and other health care providing facilities 
during  and  we derived consolidated revenues from the following payor sources for the year ended december  government private insurance workers compensation self pay other total we provide our patient services through three primary operating segments and certain other services through a fourth operating segment 
these four segments correspond to our four reporting segments discussed in this item  segment results of operations and throughout this annual report

disposal of a business unit 
the company entered into and signed a rescission agreement with amphora  llc on december  at december   all consolidated transactional information pertaining to amphora has been classified as loss on disposal 
assets held for sale 
the company determined during the fourth quarter of that it would sell three ambulatory surgical centers  asc s  reported within the ancillary services segment  to restructure the company s balance sheet 
originally the company planned to sell the asc s as a single package deal  but on january   the company was advised to syndicate these asc s in an effort to make them more attractive to a larger spectrum of potential suitors 
these subsidiaries are now listed as assets held for sale on the company s consolidated financial statements

examples include bandages  syringes  linens  injectable pharmaceuticals  and numerous other items 
in each year  our pain management and ancillary service segments comprised the majority of our supply expense

also  on december  we rescinded the acquisition of amphora  llc  in which we had ownership interest 
provision for income tax expense benefit we realized a million income tax benefit from continuing operations in as compared to an million income tax expense from continuing operations in deferred tax expense increased by approximately million to reflect the change in the noncurrent deferred taxes associated with amortization of goodwill and other assets and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we realized a million income tax expense from continuing operations in as compared to a million income tax expense from continuing operations in additionally  paincare and its subsidiaries file seperate income tax returns in a number of states  some of which result in current state income tax liabilities 
net loss from continuing operations increased million  or  from to the increase in net loss from continuing operations resulted in additional income tax expense of approximately  from to consolidated adjusted ebitda management continues to believe that an understanding of consolidated adjusted ebitda is an important measure of operating performance  leverage capacity  our ability to service our debt  and our ability to make capital expenditures for our stockholders 
in general terms  the definition of consolidated adjusted ebitda  per our credit agreement  is defined as consolidated net earnings or loss  minus extraordinary gains and interest income  plus interest expense  income taxes  and depreciation and amortization for such period  in each case  as determined in accordance with gaap 
we use consolidated adjusted ebitda on a consolidated basis to assess our operating performance 
we believe it is meaningful because it provides investors a basis using criteria that are used by our internal decision makers 
our internal decision makers believe consolidated adjusted ebitda is a meaningful measure  because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance and allows management to readily view operating trends  perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between segments 
additionally  our management believes the inclusion of professional fees associated with litigation  accounting restatement  audit and tax work associated with the restatement process  and the implementation of sarbanes oxley section and other non ordinary course charges distort within ebitda their ability to efficiently assess and view the core operating trends on a consolidated basis and within segments 
we reconcile consolidated adjusted ebitda to gain lo ss from continuing operations 
we also use consolidated adjusted ebitda on a consolidated basis as a liquidity measure 
we believe this financial measure on a consolidated basis is important in analyzing our liquidity because it is also a component of certain material covenants contained within and defined by our credit agreement 
these covenants are material terms of these agreements because they govern our credit agreement  which in turn represent a substantial portion of our capitalization 
non compliance with these financial covenants under our credit facilities our interest coverage ratio and our leverage ratio could result in the lenders requiring us to immediately repay all amounts borrowed 
any such acceleration could also lead the investors in our public debt to accelerate their maturity 
in addition  if we cannot satisfy these financial covenants in the indenture governing the credit agreements  we cannot engage in certain activities  such as incurring additional indebtedness  making certain payments  acquiring and disposing of assets 
consequently  consolidated adjusted ebitda is critical to our assessment of our liquidity 
however  consolidated adjusted ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  and the items excluded from consolidated adjusted ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance 
therefore  consolidated adjusted ebitda should not be considered a substitute for net gain loss from continuing operations or cash flows from operating  investing  or financing activities 
because consolidated adjusted ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  consolidated adjusted ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
revenue and expenses are measured in accordance with the policies and procedures described in note  summ ary of significant accounting policies  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements

results of discontinued operations and assets held for sale paincare holdings  inc  through its subsidiaries  provides healthcare services for the treatment of pain through physician practices and surgery centers in north america and canada 
paincare s surgery segment constitutes a component of the entity because the operations of and cash flows of the surgery segment can be clearly distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the rest of the entity 
with the intention of narrowing our core business strategy and to reduce debt obligations  paincare s management decided during to exit the ambulatory surgical center acquisition strategy  and has since committed to a plan to sell our interests in our three ambulatory surgical centers asc s 
paincare s asc s are classified as held for sale and measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the operations and cash flows of these asc s will be eliminated from continuing operations as a result of the sale transaction  and paincare will have no continuing involvement in the operations of the product group after it is sold 
the scenario meets the requirements of fasb statement no 

therefore paincare will report the results of operations of the component  including any gain or loss  in discontinued operations 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company records impairment losses on long lived assets held for sale when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired if the fair value less costs to sell of the assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
during  the company developed a plan to sell our three asc s with the intention of using the proceeds to pay off debt obligations 
the company plans to sell those asc s during the first half of and has estimated the sales value  net of related costs to sell  at amounts derived from preliminary discussions with our investment bankers 
accordingly  the company recorded an impairment loss of  in attributed to one of the asc s

the company may also seek additional funding through other financing vehicles 
there can be no assurances that such funding will be available at all or on terms acceptable to the company

historic sources and uses of cash our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash from operations  and our revolving credit agreement 
historically  our primary sources of funding have been cash flows from operations and borrowing under our long term debt agreements 
funds were used for working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and business acquisitions 
the following chart shows cash flows provided by or used in operating  investing and financing activities for  and for the years ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities  net cash used in investing activities   net cash provided by used in financing activities  net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents  compared to operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased million  or  from to the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities primarily relates to the increased expenses relating to restatement of prior year financials  adding additional corporate staff and increases in professional fees 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million  or  from to the decrease in cash used in investing activities primarily relates to recording four acquisitions in compared to six acquisitions in financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased million  or  from to the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities relates to our revolving credit line with hbk 
in we initiated a note payable agreement with hbk which contributed million in cash  while in  we did not receive any additional funds under our revolving loan 
compared to operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million  or  from to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities primarily relates to increases in revenues generated from the additional consolidating entities added during investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities increased million  or  from to the increase in cash used in investing activities primarily relates to the initial cash consideration paid regarding the acquisitions recorded during as well as first year cash consideration paid to the acquisitions recorded during and second year cash consideration paid to the acquisitions recorded during financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities increased million  or  from to the increase in net cash provided by financing activities relates to million received in regarding our revolving loan with hbk compared to million cash received in relating to proceeds from the issuance of debentures and common stock 
contractual obligations achieving optimal returns on cash often involves making long term commitments 
sec regulations require that we present our contractual obligations  and we have done so in the table that follows 
however  our future cash flow prospects cannot reasonably be assessed based on such obligations  as the most significant factor affecting our future cash flows is our ability to earn and collect cash from our patients and third party payors 
future cash outflows  whether they are contractual obligations or not  will vary based on our future needs 
while some such outflows are completely fixed for example  commitments to repay principal and interest on capital obligations  most will depend on future events for example  a facility has a lease for property that includes a base rent amount and an annual increase based on a percentage of the consumer price index 
further  normal operations involve significant expenditures that are not based on commitments 
examples of such expenditures include amounts paid for income taxes or for salaries and benefits 
our consolidated contractual obligations as of december   are as follows less than one three contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt   convertible debentures   capital leases     operating leases     acquisition consideration   employment agreements     total contractual obligations  financial restructuring plan and working capital needs the company plans to sell three surgery centers to raise funds for the purpose of restructuring our debt obligations 
the proceeds would be used to either pay in full or a substantial portion of the million of debt with hbk investments  lp also  the funds would be used to pay the amount due under the promissory note to the original sellers of the center for pain management ambulatory surgery center cpmasc of approximately million 
the objective is to substantially reduce the debt outstanding by using the proceeds of the sale of the surgery center division 
there may be an additional amount raised through the issuance of common stock or convertible debentures 
these proceeds would primarily be used for working capital needs 
the company would have a significantly reduced debt load if the plan is executed 
the company s working capital needs for are primarily for contingent cash payments of up to million for the acquisitions as the earnings requirements are met 
the company is expected to receive a total of approximately million as a tax refund during the third or fourth quarter of the refund will be used for working capital needs 
the company has also accrued million of penalties associated with the late filing of a registration statement 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgment that affects the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepared our consolidated financial statements 
on a regular basis  we review the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  as they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
principles of consolidation the accompanying financial statements include the accounts of paincare holdings  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
the company consolidates pshs alpha partners as it has a ownership interest in this entity  and it consolidates pshs beta partners as it has a ownership interest 
the other parties interest in these entities are reported as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements 
all significant inter company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the two entities with minority stockholders are included in discontinued operations since the company unveiled a plan to sell these facilities during the fourth quarter of the company operates thirteen practices in states with laws governing the corporate practice of medicine where a corporation is precluded from owning the medical assets and practicing medicine 
therefore  contractual arrangements are effected to allow the company to manage the practice 
emerging issues task force no 
eitf no 
states that consolidation can occur when a physician practice management entity establishes an other than temporary controlling financial interest in a physician practice through contractual arrangements 
all but one of the management services agreements between the company and the physician satisfies all of the criteria of eitf no 
the company includes revenue with respect to these practices in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with eitf no 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was  and  net of tax  for and  respectively  and resulted from the change in accounting principle from apb no 
to sfas r 
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulted from the requirement of sfas r to reduce the amount of stock based compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate or  in other words  the estimated number of shares that are not expected to vest as a result of an employee terminating prior to becoming fully vested in an award 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we did not reduce stock based compensation expense based on an estimated forfeiture rate but rather recorded an adjustment to stock based compensation as actual forfeitures occurred 
additionally  at adoption the company previously recorded the options mark to market at intrinsic value 
fas r requires these to be recorded at fair value 
the options were revalued on ja nuary  using the company s fair value methodologies and the difference is recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle is generally one time in nature and not expected to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the term of the lease  including renewal periods when appropriate  or the estimated useful lives of the improvements 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
expenditures for betterments and major improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset 
the carrying amounts of assets sold or retired and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated in the year of disposal and the resulting gains and losses are included in other income or expense 
the useful lives of operating equipment range from five to ten years  and the depreciation period for leasehold improvements ranges from three to ten years 
advertising costs advertising expenditures relating to marketing efforts consisting primarily of marketing material  brochure preparation  printing and trade show expenses are expensed as incurred 
advertising expense was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  and is included in general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes the company records income taxes using the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequence of temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of its assets and liabilities 
the company estimates its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating its tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
the recording of a net deferred tax asset assumes the realization of such asset in the future  otherwise a valuation allowance must be recorded to reduce this asset to its net realizable value 
the company considers future pretax income and  if necessary  ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for such a valuation allowance 
in the event that the company determines that it may not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset is charged against income in the period such determination is made 
the company has not recorded any valuation allowances as of december  or the company anticipates that it will generate sufficient pretax income in the future to realize its deferred tax assets 
fair value disclosures the carrying values of cash  accounts receivable  deposits  prepaid expenses  accounts payable and accrued expenses generally approximate the respective fair values of these instruments due to their current nature 
the carrying value of acquisition consideration payable consists of the value of cash and company stock to be paid per contractual obligations and approximates fair value due to the current nature of the cash obligation and the stock which is recorded at fair value 
the fair values of debt instruments for disclosure purposes only are estimated based upon the present value of the estimated cash flows at interest rates applicable to similar instruments 
the company generally does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow or market risks 
however  certain other financial instruments  such as warrants and embedded conversion features that are indexed to the company s common stock  are classified as liabilities when either a the holder possesses rights to net cash settlement or b physical or net share settlement is not within the control of the company 
in such instances  net cash settlement is assumed for financial accounting and reporting  even when the terms of the underlying contracts do not provide for net cash settlement 
such financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently adjusted to fair value at the close of each reporting period 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable 
the company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in deposit accounts with high quality  credit worthy financial institutions 
funds with these institutions exceeded the federally insured limits by approximately  on december  credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers comprising the company s customer base 
the company controls credit risk associated with its receivables through pre approvals with insurance providers 
generally  the company requires no collateral from its customers 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the more significant estimates relate to revenue recognition  contractual allowances and uncollectible accounts  intangible assets  accrued liabilities  derivative liabilities  income taxes  litigation and contingencies 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for judgments about results and the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results and values may differ significantly from these estimates 
cash and cash equivalents all short term investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents 
at december  and  the company had cash and cash equivalents denominated in canadian dollars that translate to us dollar amounts of approximately  and  respectively 
the company also has a qualified cash requirement from the hbk investments credit facility 
this requires the company to maintain a minimum consolidated balance of  in cash and cash equivalents at all times 
preferred stock the board of directors is expressly authorized at any time to provide for the issuance of shares of preferred stock in one or more series  with such voting powers  full or limited  but not to exceed one vote per share  or without voting powers  and with such designations  preferences and relative participating  optional or other special rights and qualifications  limitations or restrictions  as shall be fixed and determined in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance thereof adopted by the board of directors 
comprehensive income loss as reflected in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity  comprehensive income is a measure of net income loss and all other changes in equity that result from transactions other than with stockholders 
comprehensive income loss consists of net income loss and foreign currency translation adjustments 
comprehensive losses for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
foreign currency the company operates a subsidiary in canada  which is subject to different monetary  economic and regulatory risks than its domestic operations 
the subsidiary uses a functional currency other than us dollars  and the balance sheet accounts are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period 
the foreign entity s revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at the average rates that prevailed during the reporting period 
the resulting net translation gains and losses are reported as foreign currency translation adjustments in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
exchange gains and losses on transactions and equity investments denominated in a currency other than their functional currency are included in results of operations as incurred 
deferred financing costs deferred financing costs related to the company s various credit facilities are amortized over the related terms of the debt using the effective interest method 
net deferred financing costs were  and  at december  and  respectively  and are included as a reduction to the liability as reflected in note notes payable and note convertible debentures 
revenue recognition revenue consists of net patient fee for service revenue 
net patient fee for service revenue is recognized when services are rendered 
net patient service revenue is recorded net of contractual adjustments and other arrangements for providing services at less than established patient billing rates 
allowances for contractual adjustments and bad debts are provided for accounts receivable based on estimated collection rates 
the company estimates contractual allowances based on the patient mix at each location  the impact of contract pricing and historical collection information 
substantially all of the accounts receivable are due under fee for service contracts from third party payers  such as insurance companies and government sponsored healthcare programs or directly from patients 
services are generally provided pursuant to contracts with healthcare providers or directly to patients 
accounts receivable for services rendered have been recorded at their established charges and reduced by the estimated contractual adjustments and bad debts 
contractual adjustments result from the differences between the rates charged for services performed and reimbursements by government sponsored healthcare programs and insurance companies 
receivables generally are collected within industry norms for third party payors 
the company continuously monitors collections from its customers and maintains an allowance for bad debts based upon any specific payor collection issues that have been identified  the historical collection experience including each practice s experiences  and the aging of patient accounts receivable balances 
the company is not aware of any claims  disputes or unsettled matters with third party payors which could have a material effect on the financial statements 
the company either uses in house billing or local billing companies in each location it operates 
therefore  the company analyzes its accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts on a site by site basis as opposed to a company wide basis 
this allows the company to be more detailed and more accurate with its collection estimates 
while such credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  an inability to accurately estimate credit losses in the future could have a material adverse impact on operating results 
the estimated contractual allowance rates for each facility are reviewed periodically 
the company adjusts the contractual allowance rates  as changes to the factors discussed above become known 
as these factors change  the historical collection experience is revised accordingly in the period known 
these allowances are reviewed periodically and adjusted based on historical payment rates 
depending on the changes made in the contractual allowance rates  net revenue may increase or decrease 
changes in contractual allowances for the years ended december  and were as follows for the years ended december  balance at beginning of year including balances from purchased business combinations   increase for contractual allowance   decrease to the contractual allowance for the current year balance at end of year   a summary of the activity in the allowance for uncollectible accounts is as follows for the years ended december  balance  beginning of year   additions charged to provision for bad debts  accounts receivable written off net of recoveries  balance  end of year   the company s payor mix and aging table from continuing operations for the year ended december  were as follows balance on december  financial class current days days days private insurance     self pay      workers comp      government      other      total      allowance for doubtful accounts    net realizable value    required balance percentage estimated in allowance for for allowance for doubtful aging category amount doubtful accounts accounts current   days   days   over days   year end balance of allowance for doubtful accounts the company s payor mix and aging table for continuing operations for the year ended december  were as follows balance on december  financial class current days days days medicare      private insurance     self pay      workers compensation     government      medicaid      other      total      allowance for doubtful accounts    net realizable value    percentage required balance estimated in allowance for for allowance for doubtful aging category amount doubtful accounts accounts current   days   days   over days   year end balance of allowance for doubtful accounts recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for any amount of those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 
fin  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the requirements of fin are effective for our fiscal year beginning january  the company is evaluating the impact of fin and does not believe there will be an impact during the first quarter of in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
clarifies the definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the disclosures related to fair value measurements that are included in a company s financial statements 
sfas no 
does not expand the use of fair value measurements in financial statements  but emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement and not an entity specific measurement that should be based on an exchange transaction in which a company sells an asset or transfers a liability exit price 
sfas no 
also establishes a fair value hierarchy in which observable market data would be considered the highest level  while fair value measurements based on an entity s own assumptions would be considered the lowest level 
for calendar year companies like the company  sfas no 
is effective beginning january  the company is currently evaluating the effects  if any  that sfas no 
will have on its consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb approved eitf  debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of convertible debt instruments which modifies eitf to require a change in the value of an embedded conversion feature of a modified debt to be tested in a separate calculation 
early adoption of eitf is permitted  and the company has elected early adoption and applied the provisions of eitf to record the results of the december refinancing of its subordinated convertible notes 
in december  the fasb approved eitf  accounting for registration payment arrangements  which establishes the standard that contingent obligations to make future payments under a registration rights arrangement shall be recognized and measured separately in accordance with statement and fasb interpretation no 
 reasonable estimation of the amount of a loss 
early adoption of eitf is permitted  and the company has elected such early adoption 
as a result we have recorded an estimate of the expected registration statement penalties of million 
business outlook we were forced to devote a significant portion of our time and attention in to matters primarily outside the ordinary course of business  and those efforts have continued in  although to a much lesser extent 
at the same time  we expect to experience volume volatility  payor pressure  and increased competition in our markets 
accordingly  we anticipate our operating results will show a decline between and based on various factors 
ancillary services 
in  our ancillary services segment will continue to experience potential divestures from the three surgery centers currently listed as assets held for sale 
pain management 
in  our focus within the pain management segment will be on increasing volume growth and financial control 
we expect to see margin expansion through financial control of expenses  and by providing additional ancillary services to existing facilities as well as possible expansion to satellite locations 
surgeries 
in  our focus within the surgeries segment will be to increase the productivity of our same practice operations as well as perform segment analyses on the possible expansion of potential revenue generating ancillary services 
corporate 
in  we will strive to control costs associated with corporate segment  but this may prove difficult due to our continued investment in our infrastructure both people and technology 
we will also continue to focus on the remediation of weaknesses in our internal controls 
we will continue to replace the work performed by external consultants with paincare employees  and we will continue to add resources to provide the necessary level of support to our facilities and meet our operational needs 
while we expect our operating results will be consistent with the fact that paincare is in a reorganization period  we are optimistic about the long term positioning of paincare 
we continue to offer high quality services in growing segments of the health care industry which should provide long term growth opportunities 
in addition  we are stabilizing operations of our core business strategy of stabilized growth through highly profitable acquisitions and implementing additional ancillary services across all practices 
whatever market conditions we face  we will continue to seek opportunities to improve operations  stabilize our finances  and develop new relationships with doctors as potential future acquisitions in our industry  with the ultimate goal of providing sustainable growth and return for our stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we do not currently have any trading derivatives nor do we expect to have any in the future 
we have established policies and internal processes related to the management of market risks  which we use in the normal course of our business operations 
interest rate risk our interest rate risk  in the borrowings under our credit facility  is based on variable market interest rates 
as of december   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding under our credit facility 
at december   the revolving credit line bore interest at a rate of libor plus or prime plus 
on march  the company received from the agent for the debt notification that the interest rate would change to the default rate of libor plus 
additionally  the company has estimated a rate increase of approximately based on the average rate increase over the previous year under the variable debt 
the combination of these two factors would yield a hypothetical average interest rate of for the next year 
these increases would correspondingly decrease our pre tax earnings and operating cash flows by approximately  the actual change in the pre tax earnings and operating cash flows for the default rate is approximately  the hypothetical change in the increase to pre tax earnings and operating cash flows is  intangible asset risk we have a substantial amount of intangible assets 
we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows 
as a result of our periodic evaluations  we may determine that the intangible asset values need to be written down to their fair values  which could result in material charges that could be adverse to our operating results and financial position 
at december   we performed the impairment tests and determined impairment was needed for both goodwill and the other intangible assets 
the total impairment was  for continuing operations and  for discontinued operations 
equity price risk we do not own any equity investments  other than in our subsidiaries 
as a result  we do not currently have any direct equity price risk 
commodity price risk we do not enter into contracts for the purchase or sale of commodities 
as a result  we do not currently have any direct commodity price risk
