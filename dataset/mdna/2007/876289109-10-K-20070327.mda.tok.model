the buffalo group was started in as the distributor of buffalo branded products in canada 
initially  the buffalo brand was a denim line  but it has been expanded over time 
in  the buffalo group widened its customer base by adding us retailers 
in  the buffalo group started a private label business for retailers in canada and the us in  buffalo opened its first retail store in canada 
currently it operates retail stores in canada 
over this time buffalo has added additional brand names to its line 
it has also developed a licensing program for the buffalo brand for the sale of apparel related products in canada  and the sale of apparel products in foreign countries 
private label private label business has been our core competency for over twenty years  and involves a one to one relationship with a large  centrally controlled retailer with whom we can develop product lines that fit with the characteristics of their particular customer 
private label sales in were million compared to million in private brands we launched our private brands initiative in  pursuant to which we acquire ownership of or license rights to a brand name and sell apparel products under this brand  generally to a single retail company within a geographic region 
private brands sales in were million compared to million in during  we owned or licensed rights to the following private brands o american rag cie during the first quarter of  we extended our agreement with macy s merchandising group through  pursuant to which we exclusively distribute our american rag cie brand through macy s merchandising group s national department store organization of more than stores 
net sales of american rag cie branded apparel totaled million in compared to million in o alain weiz we have previously sold alan weiz apparel exclusively to dillard s department stores 
net sales of alain weiz branded apparel totaled million in compared to million in from january   we may sell our licensed brand alain weiz to specialty stores and department stores 
o souvenir by cynthia rowley in july  we terminated our license agreements and the parent guaranty with cynthia rowley 
in consideration of termination of the license agreements   was paid to cynthia rowley in july o gear during the fourth quarter of  k mart discontinued sales of gear products  which resulted in a decline in sales for this brand in the fourth quarter of net sales of gear branded apparel totaled million in we did not have any sales of gear branded apparel in o jessica simpson brands the js by jessica simpson brand was originally launched as a denim line with charming shoppes 
net sales of js by jessica simpson and princy by jessica simpson  which is the department store and better specialty store brand  totaled million in compared to million in in march  we became involved in a dispute with the licensor of the jessica simpson brands over our continued rights to these brands  and we are presently in litigation with this licensor 
accordingly  we did not have any sales of jessica simpson branded apparel after the first quarter of and do not anticipate any sales unless and until we are able to successfully resolve our dispute and retain our rights to these brands 
o house of dereon by tina knowles we began shipping products for the house of dereon by tina knowles brand in the fourth quarter of  resulting in net sales of  in in march  we terminated our license agreement for this brand  and sold our remaining inventory to the licensor or its designee 
prior to december   we had written off the capitalized balance of million related to the agreement and recognized a corresponding loss in net sales of house of dereon by tina knowles branded apparel totaled million in which included million of sales of inventory to a designee of the licensor 
notes receivable related party reserve in connection with the sale in of our assets and real property in mexico  the purchasers of the mexico assets issued us unsecured promissory notes of  that mature on november  and secured promissory notes of  that mature on december  and are payable in partial or total amounts anytime prior to the maturity of each note 
the secured notes are secured by the real and personal property in mexico that we sold to the purchasers 
as of september   the outstanding balance of the notes and interest receivables were million prior to the reserve 
historically  we have placed orders for purchases of fabric from the purchasers pursuant to the purchase commitment agreement we entered into at the time of the sale of the mexico assets  and we have satisfied our payment obligations for the fabric by offsetting the amounts payable against the amounts due to us under the notes 
however  during  the purchasers ceased providing fabric and are not currently making payments under the notes 
we further evaluated the recoverability of the notes receivable and recorded a loss on the notes receivable in the third quarter of in an amount equal to the outstanding balance less the value of the underlying assets securing the notes 
the loss was estimated to be approximately million  resulting in a net notes receivable balance at september  of approximately million 
we believe there was no significant change subsequently on the value of the underlying assets securing the notes  therefore  we did not have additional reserve in the fourth quarter of we will continue to pursue payment of all amounts under the notes receivable and believe the remaining million balance at december  is realizable 
the entire reserve was recorded in the luxembourg geographic reporting segment 
credit facility refinancing in june  we entered into a new million credit facility with guggenheim corporate funding  llc as agent for certain lenders and expanded our existing facilities with gmac commercial finance credit  llc and dbs bank hong kong limited 
the credit facility with guggenheim consists of an initial term loan of million  of which million was advanced at the initial closing 
the initial term loan was or will be used to repay certain existing indebtedness and fund general operating and working capital needs 
a second term loan of up to million will be available to finance acquisitions acceptable to guggenheim as agent 
in addition  in june  our credit facility with gmac commercial finance credit  llc and other lenders was increased from million to million  and our credit facility with dbs bank hong kong limited was increased from million to million 
these financings significantly expand our borrowing base  which provides us with enhanced financial flexibility 
internal revenue service audit in january  the internal revenue service completed its examination of our federal income tax returns for the years ended december  through the irs has proposed adjustments to increase our income tax payable for the six years under examination 
in addition  in july  the irs initiated an examination of our federal income tax return for the year ended december  in march  the irs proposed an adjustment to our taxable income of approximately million related to similar issues identified in their audit of the through federal income tax returns 
the proposed adjustments to our federal income tax return would not result in additional tax due for that year due to the tax loss reported in the federal return 
however  it could reduce the amount of net operating losses available to offset taxes due from the preceding tax years 
this adjustment would also result in additional state taxes  penalties and interest 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to and intend to vigorously contest the proposed adjustments made to our federal income tax returns for the years ended through if the proposed adjustments are upheld through the administrative and legal process  they could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flow 
we believe we have provided adequate reserves for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters on the consolidated balance sheets under the caption income taxes 
the maximum amount of loss in excess of the amount accrued in the financial statements is million 
we do not believe that the adjustments  if any  arising from the irs examination  will result in an additional income tax liability beyond what is recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we are required to make assumptions about matters  which are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate 
different estimates we could reasonably have used or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material effect on our financial condition or result of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate estimates  including those related to returns  discounts  bad debts  inventory  notes receivable related parties reserve  intangible assets  income taxes  stock options valuation  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
in addition  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged period of time 
we believe our financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and provide a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable allowance for returns  discounts and bad debts we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable and chargebacks disputes from the customer based upon a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit sources  a specific reserve for bad debts is taken against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts and uncollectible chargebacks based on our historical collection experience 
if collection experience deteriorates for example  due to an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount 
as of december   the balance in the allowance for returns  discounts and bad debts reserves was million  compared to million at december  inventory our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
under certain market conditions  we use estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory to properly value inventory 
inventory adjustments are made for the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value and charged to operations in the period in which the facts that give rise to the adjustments become known 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  the following o a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  o a significant change in the manner of the use of the acquired asset or the strategy for the overall business  or o a significant negative industry or economic trend 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
according to this statement  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer subject to amortization  but rather an annual assessment of impairment applied on a fair value based test on an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we utilized the discounted cash flow methodology to estimate fair value 
at december   we have a goodwill balance of million  and a net property and equipment balance of million  as compared to a goodwill balance of million and a net property and equipment balance of million at december  during the years ended december  and  we did not recognize any impairment related to goodwill and property and equipment 
we assess the carrying value of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in  we evaluated the long lived assets in mexico for recoverability and concluded that the book value of the asset group was significantly higher than the expected future cash flows and that impairment had occurred 
accordingly  we recognized a non cash impairment loss of approximately million in the second quarter of the impairment charge was the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the impaired assets 
our determination of fair value was determined based on independent appraisals of the property and equipment obtained in june foreign currency translation assets and liabilities of our mexico and hong kong subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date  income and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the respective periods 
the functional currency in which we transact business in hong kong is the hong kong dollar and in mexico is the peso 
foreign currency gains and losses resulting from translation of assets and liabilities are included in other comprehensive income loss 
transaction gains or losses  other than inter company debt deemed to be of a long term nature  are included in net income loss in the period in which they occur 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the point of shipment for all merchandise sold based on fob shipping point 
for merchandise shipped on landed duty paid ldp terms  revenue is recognized at the point of either leaving customs for direct shipments or at the point of leaving our warehouse where title is transferred  net of an estimate of returned merchandise and discounts 
customers are allowed the rights of return or non acceptance only upon receipt of damaged products or goods with quality different from shipment samples 
we do not undertake any after sale warranty or any form of price protection 
we often arrange  on behalf of manufacturers  for the purchase of fabric from a single supplier 
we have the fabric shipped directly to the cutting factory and invoice the factory for the fabric 
generally  the factories pay us for the fabric with offsets against the price of the finished goods 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
sfas no 
r supersedes our previous accounting under accounting principles board opinion abp no

we have applied the provisions of sab no 
in our adoption of sfas no 
r 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of our fiscal year our financial statements as of and for year ended december  reflect the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas no 
r 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas no 
r during the year ended december  was  basic and dilutive earnings per share for the year ended december  were decreased by from to by the additional stock based compensation recognized 
the fair value of each option granted to employees and directors is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants in  and weighted average volatility factors of the expected market price of our common stock of to for  for and for  weighted average risk free interest rates of to for  for and for  dividend yield of for  and  and weighted average expected life of the options of years for  and years for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these timing differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
management records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
management has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
increases in the valuation allowance result in additional expense to be reflected within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  accruals are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding us federal tax issues that are currently unresolved  based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
we routinely monitor the potential impact of these situations and believe that amounts are properly accrued for 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we will reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we will record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in any period we determine that the original estimate of a tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of current tax matters 
debt covenants our debt agreements require certain covenants including a minimum level of ebitda and specified tangible net worth  and required interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
if our results of operations erode and we are not able to obtain waivers from the lenders  the debt would be in default and callable by our lenders 
in addition  due to cross default provisions in our debt agreements  substantially all of our long term debt would become due in full if any of the debt is in default 
in anticipation of us not being able to meet the required covenants due to various reasons  we either negotiate for changes in the relative covenants or an advance waiver or reclassify the relevant debt as current 
we also believe that our lenders would provide waivers if necessary 
however  our expectations of future operating results and continued compliance with other debt covenants cannot be assured and our lenders actions are not controllable by us 
if projections of future operating results are not achieved and the debt is placed in default  we would be required to reduce our expenses  including by curtailing operations  and to raise capital through the sale of assets  issuance of equity or otherwise  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   we were in violation of the ebitda  tangible net worth and leverage ratio covenants and waivers of the defaults were obtained in march from our lenders 
derivative activities warrant derivatives sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires measurement of certain derivative instruments at their fair value for accounting purposes 
in determining the appropriate fair value  we use the black scholes merton option pricing formula the black scholes model 
derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each period end  with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in consolidated statements of operations as adjustments to fair value of derivatives 
at december   there was an income of  recorded as adjustment to fair value of derivative on our consolidated statements of operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements foreign currency forward contract we source our products in a number of countries throughout the world  as a result  are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to manage the volatility associated with foreign currency purchases of materials in the normal course of business 
we utilize derivative financial instruments consist primarily of forward currency contracts 
these instruments are intended to protect against exposure related to financing transactions and income from international operations 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we enter into certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not meet hedge accounting criteria 
sfas no 
requires measurement of certain derivative instruments at their fair value for accounting purposes 
all derivative instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value  as a result  we mark to market all derivative instruments 
derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each period end  with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in consolidated statements of operations as adjustments to fair value of derivatives 
there were no exchange contracts at december  during the year ended december   we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain inter company financing transactions 
this transaction is undesignated and as such an ineffective hedge 
at december   we had one open foreign exchange forward which has a maturity of less than one year 
hedge ineffectiveness resulted in an impact of  in our consolidated statements of operations as of december  new accounting pronouncements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

as is typical for us  quarterly net sales fluctuated significantly because our customers typically place bulk orders with us  and change in the number of orders shipped in any one period may have a material effect on the net sales for that period 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements arise from the funding of our working capital needs  principally inventory  finished goods shipments in transit  work in process and accounts receivable  including receivables from our contract manufacturers that relate primarily to fabric we purchase for use by those manufacturers 
our primary sources for working capital and capital expenditures are cash flow from operations  borrowings under our bank and other credit facilities  issuance of long term debt  sales of equity and debt securities  and vendor financing 
in the near term  we expect that our operations and borrowings under bank and other credit facilities will provide sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses  capital expenditures and interest payments on our debt 
in the long term  we expect to use internally generated funds and external sources to satisfy our debt and other long term liabilities 
our liquidity is dependent  in part  on customers paying on time 
any abnormal chargebacks or returns may affect our source of short term funding

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies as a result of doing business in foreign jurisdictions 
as a result  we bear the risk of exchange rate gains and losses that may result in the future 
at times we use forward exchange contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuations of foreign currencies on purchases and commitments 
these short term assets and commitments are principally related to trade payables positions 
at december   we had one open foreign exchange forward which has a maturity of less than one year 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
we actively evaluate the creditworthiness of the financial institutions that are counter parties to derivative financial instruments  and we do not expect any counter parties to fail to meet their obligations 
interest rate risk 
because our obligations under our various credit agreements bear interest at floating rates  we are sensitive to changes in prevailing interest rates 
any major increase or decrease in market interest rates that affect our financial instruments would have a material impact on earning or cash flows during the next fiscal year 
our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect interest paid on our debt 
a majority of our credit facilities are at variable rates 
as of december   we had  of fixed rate borrowings and million of variable rate borrowings outstanding 
a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of approximately million on our variable rate borrowings
