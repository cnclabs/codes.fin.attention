item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and note of the consolidated financial statements for discussion of our credit facility  covenant requirements and effects on our business 

table of contents we may be unable to fund our significant future capital needs and we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated we will need substantial capital to finance our operations and expansion plans  including funds for capital expenditures  pre opening costs and potential initial operating losses related to new restaurant openings 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms 
if adequate funds are not available  we will have to curtail projected growth  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
moreover  if we issue additional equity securities  the holdings of existing shareholders may be diluted 
although we expect that borrowings under our credit facility  combined with other resources  will be sufficient to fund our capital requirements at least through fiscal  this may not be the case 
our credit facility limits our capital expenditures in future years  including a maximum of million in fiscal  subject to the satisfaction of certain bank covenants 
we may be required to seek additional capital earlier than anticipated if future actual cash flows from operations fail to meet our expectations  costs and capital expenditures for new restaurant development exceed anticipated amounts  landlord contributions  loans and other incentives are lower than expected  the costs of the sec investigation and other related litigation exceed anticipated amounts  we were to acquire an additional concept or company or pursue other strategic ventures  we are required to reduce prices to respond to competitive pressures  or we are unable to achieve the required bank covenants 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our historical and anticipated capital needs 
we may be unable to maintain favorable comparable restaurant sales results improvements in comparable restaurant sales are a key measure of financial health for our overall company as well as for our individual restaurants 
we experienced a decline in comparable restaurant sales in each year from fiscal through fiscal for our buca di beppo restaurants 
although we experienced an increase in comparable restaurant sales for buca di beppo in fiscal and fiscal  we may not see improvements in comparable restaurant sales in the future 
if we are unable to achieve and maintain positive comparable restaurant sales  we may continue to experience operating losses or negative cash flows and we may close those restaurants  which could result in significant exit costs  including lease termination costs 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the lease termination costs that we incurred in fiscal and our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to expand in a timely and profitable manner during fiscal  we opened one new restaurant and closed a total of three 
during fiscal  we did not open any new restaurants and  in the first quarter of fiscal  we closed one restaurant 
this reflects a reduction in our expansion activities relative to our history 
we intend to resume openings and are working toward opening one new restaurant in fiscal and three to five new restaurants in fiscal to grow successfully through new restaurant additions  we must open new buca di beppo restaurants on a timely and profitable basis 
we have experienced delays in restaurant openings from time to time and may experience delays in the future 
delays or failures in opening new restaurants could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
our ability to expand successfully will depend on a number of factors  some of which are not entirely within our control  including the identification and availability of suitable restaurant sites  competition for restaurant sites  
table of contents negotiation of favorable leases  timely development in certain cases of commercial  residential  street or highway construction near our restaurants  management of construction and development costs of new restaurants  securing of required governmental approvals  permits and licenses  recruitment of qualified operating personnel  particularly paisano partners and chef partners  competition in new markets  limitations under our credit facility  and general economic conditions 
in addition  we may enter new markets in which we have no operating experience 
these new markets may have different demographic characteristics  competitive conditions  consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets  which may cause our new restaurants to be less successful in these new markets than in our existing markets 
insurers could deny or rescind coverage for the securities litigation filed against us which could result in a significant uninsured loss a civil action has been filed against us asserting claims under the securities exchange act of  and seeking compensatory damages in an unspecified amount  plus an award of attorneys fees and costs of litigation 
we are not able to predict the ultimate outcome of this litigation  and the total costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time  however  the plaintiffs are likely to seek damages in an amount that would be significant and material to us 
while we have had and continue to maintain directors and officers insurance and have submitted the suit to our insurers for coverage  our insurers have reserved their rights with respect to coverage 
if our insurers were to attempt to deny or rescind coverage and were ultimately successful  we could face significant legal expenses in defending the action and we would have to pay any judgment to  or settlement with  the plaintiffs from our own resources 
in addition  any judgment could be in excess of our policy limits  requiring us to pay the remainder directly ourselves 
such denial  rescission or judgment in excess of the policy limits would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operation and cash flows 
an unfavorable finding in the ongoing sec investigation could have a material adverse effect on us as previously disclosed  we are the subject of an ongoing sec investigation 
we have cooperated with this investigation both before and after issuance of the formal order of investigation in february we understand that the order of investigation relates to our internal controls and compliance with rules governing filings and reports  including public disclosures  required to be filed with the sec  and the purchase of an old farmhouse in italy known as villa sermenino 
we are cooperating and assisting with the sec s investigation in order to bring the inquiry to a conclusion as promptly as possible 
we are unable to predict the ultimate focus or outcome of the investigation  or when it will be completed 
any unfavorable finding from the sec as a result of the investigation could have a material adverse effect on our reputation  business  results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
see item legal proceedings for a discussion of the sec s investigation 
further instances of breakdowns in our internal controls over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on us we maintain a system of internal controls over financial reporting that is reviewed and monitored by our management and our audit committee and tested by an independent internal audit consulting firm 
as of the end of fiscal and fiscal  our management identified certain material weaknesses in our system of internal controls 

table of contents while significant changes in executive personnel were made during fiscal and fiscal  our company has suffered in the past from an inappropriate tone set by former senior executives and a lack of a demonstrable commitment by former senior executives to set high standards of ethics  integrity  accounting and corporate governance 
our board of directors and current management believe that these inappropriate attitudes and deeds of former senior executives led to an environment where strong systems of internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures were not supported 
we have taken remedial measures to correct such control deficiencies 
we have devoted significant resources to document  test  monitor and improve our internal controls and will continue to do so  however  we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that our controls are adequate in the future or that the controls will be effective in preventing fraud or material misstatement 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and fraud may be easier to perpetrate on us 
any failures in the effectiveness of our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations 
inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on our stock price 
competition may adversely affect our operations and financial results the restaurant business is highly competitive with respect to price  service  restaurant location and food quality  and is often affected by changes in consumer tastes  economic conditions  population and traffic patterns 
we compete within each market with locally owned restaurants as well as national and regional restaurant chains  some of which operate more restaurants and have greater financial resources and longer operating histories than we do 
there is active competition for management personnel and for attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for restaurants 
if we are unable to effectively compete within the restaurant industry  our operations and financial results could be adversely affected 
see item business competition for a discussion of the competition we face 
complaints  litigation  governmental investigations and the related adverse publicity may materially adversely affect us we are from time to time the subject of complaints or litigation from guests alleging illness  injury or other food quality  health or operational concerns 
these claims may divert our financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit the future performance of our operations 
three virtually identical civil actions were commenced against our company and three former officers in the united states district court for the district of minnesota between august  and september  the three actions have been consolidated 
the four lead plaintiffs filed and served a consolidated amended complaint the complaint on january  the complaint was brought on behalf of a class consisting of all persons who purchased our common stock in the market during the time period from february  through march  the class period 
we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint  which was granted on october  on december   the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated complaint second complaint 
the second complaint alleges that in press releases and sec filings issued during the class period  defendants made materially false and misleading statements about our company s income  revenues  and internal controls  which allegedly had the result of artificially inflating the market price for our stock 
the lead plaintiffs assert claims under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  and seek compensatory damages in an unspecified amount  plus an award of attorneys fees and costs of litigation 
we have responded to the second complaint and have moved to dismiss it 
we are not able to predict the ultimate outcome of this litigation  but it may be costly and disruptive 
the total costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
federal securities litigation can result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources  which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations  including cash flows 

table of contents see also an unfavorable finding in the ongoing sec investigation could have a material adverse effect on us above for a description of an on going sec investigation 
multi unit restaurant businesses can also be adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality  food borne illness or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants 
in particular  since we depend on the buca di beppo brand for all of our revenues  unfavorable publicity relating to one or more buca di beppo restaurants could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
additional instances of food borne illnesses  avian flu  mad cow disease or other similar matters could have a material adverse effect on us in  several nationally known restaurants experienced outbreaks of food poisoning believed to be caused by e 
coli contained in the produce they used 
in addition  e 
coli was also reported in fresh spinach which resulted in us removing several items  including a popular salad  from our menu until we can confirm the safety of the fresh spinach we purchase 
in and  asian and european countries experienced outbreaks of avian flu 
incidents of mad cow disease have occurred in canadian and us cattle herds 
these problems  other food borne illnesses such as  hepatitis a  trichinosis or salmonella and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past  and could in the future  adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause changes in consumer preference 
as a result  our sales could decline 
instances of food borne illnesses  real or perceived  whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors  could also result in negative publicity about us or the restaurant industry  which could adversely affect sales 
if we react to negative publicity by changing our menu or other key aspects of the dining experience we offer  we may lose customers who do not accept those changes  and may not be able to attract enough new customers to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable 
if our guests become ill from food borne illnesses  we could be forced to temporarily close some restaurants 
a decrease in guest traffic as a result of health concerns or negative publicity  or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants  could materially harm our business 
fluctuations in our operating results may result in decreases in our stock price our operating results will fluctuate significantly because of several factors  including increases or decreases in comparable restaurant sales  the timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses  profitability of new restaurants  timing of unexpected charges  general economic conditions  seasonality of restaurant sales  consumer confidence in the economy  changes in consumer preferences  impairment of restaurant assets  changes in interest rates  competitive factors and weather conditions 
as a result  our operating results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in that event  the price of our common stock would likely decrease 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of our historical operating results 
inflation could materially adversely affect our operating results the majority of our operating expenses have increased due to inflation 
because we are in a competitive industry  we may be limited in the amount of menu prices we can increase 
if we are unable to offset increases in operating expenses due to inflation  it could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
increased food costs could materially adversely affect our operating results our operating results depend in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food costs 
our agreement with dma runs to april any increase in distribution prices or failure to perform by dma could 
table of contents cause our food costs to increase 
in addition  various factors beyond our control  including adverse weather conditions  fluctuations in foreign currency and governmental regulation  may affect our food costs 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices  and a failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
changes in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending could negatively impact our results our restaurants feature italian cuisine served primarily in small and large family style portions 
our continued success depends  in part  upon the popularity of this type of italian cuisine and this style of informal dining 
shifts in consumer preferences away from our cuisine or dining style could materially adversely affect our future profitability 
also  our success depends to a significant extent on numerous factors affecting discretionary consumer spending  including economic conditions  disposable consumer income and consumer confidence 
our business may also be affected by changes in consumer tastes and the impact on consumer eating habits of new information regarding diet  nutrition and health 
adverse changes in these factors could reduce guest traffic or impose practical limits on pricing  either of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
our restaurant operations are influenced by weather conditions weather  which is unpredictable  can adversely impact our sales 
harsh weather conditions that keep customers from dining out result in lost opportunities for our restaurants 
a heavy snowstorm or hurricane can restrict travel in an entire metropolitan area  resulting in a reduction in sales 
for these reasons  a quarter to quarter comparison may not be a good indication of our performance or how we may perform in the future 
our operations depend on governmental licenses and complying with government regulations each of our restaurants is subject to licensing and regulation by alcoholic beverage control  health  sanitation  safety and fire agencies in the state  county and or municipality in which the restaurant is located 
we may experience difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licenses or approvals 
if we fail to hold all necessary licenses  we may be forced to delay or cancel new restaurant openings and close or reduce operations at existing locations 
we also are subject to federal and state environmental regulations and adverse changes in these regulations could have a material negative effect on our operations 
for example  more stringent and varied requirements of local and state governmental bodies with respect to zoning  land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations 
we are subject to the fair labor standards act  which governs such matters as minimum wages  overtime and other working conditions  along with the ada  various family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted  or rules and regulations promulgated  by federal  state and local governmental authorities that govern these and other employment matters 
a material increase in the minimum wage and other statutory benefits could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  the ada prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment 
although our restaurants are designed to be accessible to the disabled  we could be required to reconfigure our restaurants to provide service to  or make reasonable accommodations for  disabled persons 
such modifications could be costly 

table of contents we may face liability under dram shop statutes our sale of alcoholic beverages subjects us to dram shop statutes in most states 
these statutes allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishment that served alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person 
if we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage  or if we fail to maintain our insurance coverage  our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
see item business government regulation for a discussion of the regulations with which we must comply 
we could face potential labor shortages and increases in labor costs our success depends in part upon our ability to attract  motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  including restaurant managers  kitchen staff and wait staff 
qualified individuals needed to fill these positions are in short supply in certain areas  and the inability to recruit and retain such individuals may delay the planned openings of new restaurants or result in high employee turnover in existing restaurants  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract sufficient employees  which could result in higher labor costs 
in addition  we have a substantial number of hourly employees who are paid the federal or state minimum wage and who rely on tips for a significant portion of their income 
government mandated increases in minimum wages  overtime pay  paid leaves of absence  or health benefits  or increased tax reporting and tax payment requirements for employees who receive gratuities  or a reduction in the number of states that allow tips to be credited toward minimum wage requirements  could increase our labor costs and reduce our operating margins 
increased energy costs and power outages may adversely affect our operating results our success depends in part on our ability to absorb increases in utility costs 
utility costs have been increasing across the country and various regions of the united states in which we operate multiple restaurants  particularly california  have experienced significant and temporary increases in utility prices 
we have in the past closed restaurants on a temporary basis due to the inability to receive electrical power 
if these increases should recur or continue  it may adversely affect our operating results 
additionally  our contract with our primary food distributor  dma  allows for some fluctuation in distribution fees based on the price of diesel fuel 
a significant increase in the price of diesel fuel may result in increased expenses 
we may suffer from uninsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business we have comprehensive insurance  including general liability  fire  extended coverage and employee practices liability coverage 
however  there are certain types of losses that may be uninsurable or that we believe are not economically insurable  such as earthquakes  hurricanes and other natural disasters  and terrorist attacks 
in view of the location of many of our existing and planned restaurants in california and florida and other earthquake and hurricane prone areas of the united states  our operations are susceptible to damage and disruption caused by earthquakes and hurricanes 
in the event of an earthquake  hurricane or other natural disaster affecting one or more geographic areas of our operations  we could suffer a loss of the capital invested in  as well as anticipated earnings from  the damaged or destroyed properties 
the terrorist attacks on the united states had a significant impact on the portion of our business that is celebratory in nature and adversely affected our restaurant sales and profitability 
the threats of additional terrorists attacks and continuing uncertainty created by the war on terrorism  could cause a potential downturn in the economy and a decrease in consumer spending 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows

the lease on our chicago clark street restaurant expired in february and we made the decision to not exercise our option to renew the lease 
this restaurant was closed in february we intend to resume new restaurant openings and are working toward opening one new restaurant in fiscal and three to five new restaurants in fiscal we also intend to explore the option of franchising and selling development rights to our restaurants in certain select markets beginning in fiscal during fiscal  we implemented a price increase of approximately on food items at our buca di beppo restaurants 
the primary reason for this price increase was to offset rising operational costs  particularly in product and occupancy expenses

the credit agreement includes various affirmative and negative covenants  including certain financial covenants such as minimum ebitda as defined in the agreement  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum limits on capital expenditures and the acquisition or construction of new restaurants in any fiscal year 
payments under the credit agreement may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default  as defined in the credit agreement that is not otherwise waived or cured 
as of march   we were in default of the financial covenants regarding minimum ebitda and fixed charge coverage ratio 
as a result  an amendment and waiver was negotiated and received in april in exchange for the amendment and waiver  we paid our new lenders fees totaling million and the interest rate on the term loan b portion of the credit facility was increased 
based upon the fiscal consolidated financial statements  as of december   we were in default of the financial covenants regarding minimum ebitda and fixed charge coverage ratio 
as a result  an amendment and waiver was negotiated and received in march in exchange for the amendment and waiver  we paid our lender a fee of million 

table of contents in september  we completed the sale and simultaneous leaseback of eight restaurant locations with affiliates of cric capital at a sale price of million the sale leaseback transaction 
the net proceeds of the sale leaseback transaction were used to prepay  in its entirety  the outstanding term loan b facility with ableco and to prepay a portion of the outstanding term loan a facility with wells fargo foothill 
a premium equal to four percent of the outstanding principal amount of the term loan b was paid in connection with the prepayment of the term loan b facility

pursuant to the amendment and consent  the lenders consented to the sale leaseback transaction subject to the prepayment of the term loan b facility and term loan a facility as provided above  agreed to amend the minimum ebitda coverage required for relevant testing periods in fiscal year  and agreed to amend the credit agreement in certain other respects 
in consideration the amendment and consent  we agreed to increase the interest rate on each of the remaining term loan a facility and the revolving credit facility by per annum 
on september   we completed the sale of vinny t s of boston restaurants to bertucci s corporation 
the sale price was million  of which  million was paid in cash at closing million net of banker fees and other expenses and million was paid through a promissory note issued at closing 
the promissory note matures on june  or earlier upon the occurrence of certain other events  including a change in control of bertucci s or the repayment or refinancing of bertucci s outstanding senior notes 
the proceeds of the sale  net of investment banker fees and other transaction related expenses  were used to retire the term loan a and reduce our outstanding indebtedness on the revolving credit facility 
on march   we executed an amendment to our credit agreement with wells fargo foothill 
pursuant to the amendment  the lenders agreed to expand our maximum revolver amount to million and agreed to amend the credit agreement in certain other respects 
in exchange for the amendment  we paid our lender a fee of  the interest rate on the revolving credit facility is wells fargo s reference rate plus a margin 
the specific margin is corresponds to a range to percentage points as determined by our leverage ratio 
we also have the option of utilizing a libor rate plus a specific margin as determined by our leverage ratio 
our interest rate on the revolving credit facility was the wells fargo reference rate plus percentage points which was on december  and on december  under the credit facility  our annual capital expenditures are limited to million and the agreement includes covenants that place restrictions on sales or properties  transactions with affiliates  creation of additional debt  limitations on our ability to sign leases for new restaurants  maintenance of certain financial covenants and other customary covenants

amounts borrowed under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets 
as of march   we had outstanding borrowings of approximately million under our revolving credit facility and our availability under the revolving credit facility was approximately million 
our capital requirements  including development costs related to the opening of additional restaurants  have been significant 
we reduced our development plans beginning in fiscal while we implemented strategies designed to improve our comparable restaurant sales and our cash flow from operations 
we may need substantial capital to finance our expansion plans  which require funds for capital expenditures  pre opening costs and initial operating losses related to new restaurant openings 
in addition  we have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to the on going litigation and related matters 
the adequacy of available funds and our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  the costs and capital expenditures for new restaurant development and the nature of contributions  loans and other arrangements negotiated with landlords 
although we can make no assurance  we believe that our available cash  cash flows from operations  and our available borrowings will be sufficient to fund our capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
to fund future operations  we may need to raise additional capital through public or private equity or debt financing to continue our growth 
in addition  we have and may continue to consider acquiring the operations of other companies 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
we cannot predict whether additional capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table provides aggregate information about our contractual payment obligations and the periods in which payments are due in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations interest expense total represents aggregate minimum lease payments 
most of our leases also require contingent rent in addition to the minimum base rent based on a percentage of sales ranging from to and require expenses incidental to the use of the property which has been excluded from this table 
this amount also excludes any asset retirement obligations see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in determining purchase obligations for this table we used our interpretation of the definition set forth in the sec final rule  disclosure in management s discussion and analysis about off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations  which states  a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the registrant and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
includes interest on asset based notes

all standby letters of credit are renewable annually

application of critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements include accounts of buca  inc and all of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to our consolidated financial statements describes our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those we believe are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results  and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially 
table of contents different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment land  buildings  leasehold improvements  tenant improvements and equipment are recorded at original cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
these assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or associated lease term  ranging from three to years 
land is not depreciated because we believe that it retains its historical value 
our estimate of the useful life of equipment three to seven years and buildings years is based upon the historical life of similar assets in our industry 
leasehold improvements are generally depreciated over the term of the lease  including certain option periods  because we believe a majority of these assets will exist as long as we are tenants of the various properties 
the estimated useful lives and fair market value of these assets as well as our determination of what constitutes a capitalized cost versus a repair and maintenance expense involves judgments by management 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation and amortization expense if different assumptions were used 
as discussed below  these judgments may also impact the need and amount to recognize as an impairment charge on the carrying amount of these assets 
leases in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases  and subsequent amendments  each lease is evaluated at inception to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease 
minimum base rent for our operating leases  which generally have escalating rentals over the term of the lease  is recorded on a straight line basis over the entire lease term  including cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in economic penalty  not to exceed years 
the initial rent term includes the build out  or rent holiday period  for our leases  where no rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
contingent rent expense  which is based on a percentage of revenue  is also recorded to the extent it exceeds minimum base rent per the lease agreement 
we account for construction allowances by recording a receivable when its collectibility is considered certain  depreciating the leasehold improvements over the lesser of their useful lives or the full term of the lease  including renewal options and build out periods  amortizing the construction allowance as a credit to rent expense over the full term of the lease  including renewal options and build out periods  and relieving the receivable once the cash is obtained from the landlord for the construction allowance 
we disburse cash for leasehold improvements and furnishings  fixtures and equipment to build out and equip our leased premises 
we may also expend cash for structural components of the building that we make to leased premises that generally are reimbursed to us by our landlords as construction contributions pursuant to agreed upon terms in our leases 
landlord construction contributions usually take the form of up front cash  full or partial credits against minimum or percentage rents otherwise payable by us  or a combination thereof 
depending on the specifics of the leased space  the lease agreement and in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction  during the construction period the amounts paid for structural components are recorded as either prepaid rent or construction in progress and the landlord construction contributions are recorded as either an offset to prepaid rent or as a deemed landlord financing liability 
impairment of long lived assets we review our long lived assets  such as fixed assets and intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable  but at least quarterly 
we consider a history of consistent and significant operating losses to be a primary indicator of potential asset impairment 
assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows  primarily the individual restaurants 
a restaurant is deemed to be impaired if a 
table of contents forecast of its future operating cash flows directly related to the restaurant is less than its carrying amount 
if a restaurant is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the restaurant exceeds its fair value 
fair value is an estimate based on the best information available including prices for similar assets or the results of valuation techniques such as discounted estimated future cash flows  as if the decision to continue to use the impaired restaurant was a new investment decision 
judgments and estimates made related to long lived assets are affected by factors such as economic conditions  changes in historical resale values and changes in operating performance 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
self insurance we are self insured for a significant portion of our current medical  dental  workers compensation and general liability insurance programs 
in estimating our self insurance reserves  we utilize estimates of future losses  based upon our historical loss trends and historical industry data and actuarial estimates of settlement costs for incurred claims 
these reserves are monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
should an additional change in claims occur compared to our current estimates  our reserves could be either increased or decreased based upon that data 
any increases or decreases in insurance reserves would be offset by a corresponding increase or decrease in insurance expense 
income taxes we estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes 
the estimates include effective state and local income tax rates  the tax rate in which deferred taxes are recognized  and the likelihood that we will be able to utilize our deferred tax assets 
our estimates are based on the best available information at the time that we prepare the provision 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the tax returns are filed  and could be subject to different interpretations of the tax laws 
the ultimate amount of income taxes that we pay may be higher or lower than our estimates 
we record a tax valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that we will not be able to recover the value of our deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against the benefit from income taxes due to continued uncertainty regarding whether we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets due to our recent operating losses 
estimated liability for closing restaurants we make decisions to close restaurants based on prospects for estimated future profitability 
we evaluate each restaurant s performance every quarter 
when restaurants continue to perform poorly  we consider the demographics of the location  as well as the likelihood of being able to improve an unprofitable restaurant 
if we determine that the restaurant will not  within a reasonable period of time  operate at break even cash flow or be profitable  we may close the restaurant 
the estimated liability for closing restaurants on properties vacated is generally based on the term of the lease and the lease termination fee we expect to pay  as well as estimated maintenance costs until the lease has been abated 
the amount of the estimated liability established is generally the present value of these estimated future payments upon exiting the property 
the interest rate used to calculate the present value of these liabilities is based on our incremental borrowing rate at the time the liability is established 
a significant assumption used in determining the amount of the estimated liability for closing restaurants is the amount of the estimated liability for future lease payments on vacant restaurants  which we determine based on our assessment of our ability to successfully negotiate early terminations of our lease agreements with our landlords or sublease the property 
additionally  we estimate the cost to maintain leased and owned vacant properties until the lease has been abated 
if the costs to maintain properties increase  or it takes longer than 
table of contents anticipated to sell properties or sublease or terminate leases  we may need to record additional estimated liabilities 
if the leases on the vacant restaurants are not terminated or subleased on the terms we used to estimate the liabilities  we may be required to record losses in future periods 
conversely  if the leases on the vacant restaurants are terminated or subleased on more favorable terms than we used to estimate the liabilities  we reverse previously established estimated liabilities  resulting in an increase in operating income 
loss contingencies we maintain accrued liabilities and reserves relating to the resolution of certain contingent obligations 
significant contingencies include those related to litigation 
we account for contingent obligations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  as interpreted by fasb interpretation no 
which requires that we assess each contingency to determine estimates of the degree of probability and range of possible settlement 
contingencies which are deemed to be probable and where the amount of such settlement is reasonably estimable are accrued in our financial statements 
if only a range of loss can be determined  we accrue to the best estimate within that range  if none of the estimates within that range is better than another  we accrue to the low end of the range 
the assessment of loss contingencies is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events 
contingencies are reviewed at least quarterly to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related financial statement disclosure 
the ultimate settlement of loss contingencies may differ significantly from amounts we have accrued in our financial statements 
share based compensation prior to fiscal  we accounted for our share based employee compensation plans under the measurement and recognition provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we generally recorded no employee compensation expense for options granted prior to fiscal  as options granted generally had exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we also recorded no compensation expense in connection with our employee stock purchase plan espp as the purchase price of the stock was not less than of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each offering period 
we had recognized compensation expense related to non vested restricted stock issued to employees in fiscal in accordance with sfas no 
 we disclosed our net income and earnings per share as if we had applied the fair value based method in measuring compensation expense for our share based incentive awards 
effective as of fiscal  we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expense that we recognize beginning in fiscal includes expense associated with the fair value of all awards granted on and after december  the beginning of our fiscal year  expense for the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding on december   and compensation for the discount eligible employees receive as part of the espp 
results for prior periods have not been adjusted 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model and the assumptions shown in note to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on our historical volatility rate  consistent with sfas no 
r and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
our decision to use historical volatility was based upon the lack of actively traded options on our common stock 
we estimate the expected term consistent with the simplified method identified in sab for share based awards granted during fiscal the simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of the vesting and contractual terms of the award 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee options 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures 
table of contents and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
for options granted  we amortize the fair value on a straight line basis 
all options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change we may decide to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect our net income and earnings per share 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food and labor costs 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage and increases in the minimum wage directly affect our labor costs 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on borrowings under our credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of a borrowing base determined in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement and million including a letter of credit sub facility of up to an aggregate of million 
the interest rate on the revolving credit facility is wells fargo s reference rate plus a margin 
the specific margin corresponds to a range to percentage points as determined by our leverage ratio 
we also have the option of utilizing a libor rate plus a specific margin as determined by our leverage ratio 
as of march   we had approximately million outstanding in debt borrowings under our credit facility 
thus  a change in interest rates would cause annual interest expense to increase by  we have no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
many of the food products purchased by us are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  production problems  delivery difficulties and other factors that are outside our control 
to control this risk in part  we have fixed price purchase commitments for food and supplies from vendors who supply our national food distributor 
in addition  we believe that substantially all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food commodity risks 
we believe we have the ability to increase menu prices  or vary the menu items offered  if needed  in response to a food product price increase 
to compensate for a hypothetical price increase of for food and beverages  we would need to increase menu prices by an average of  which is only slightly more than our average price increases of approximately in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal accordingly  we believe that a hypothetical increase in food product costs would not have a material effect on our operating results
