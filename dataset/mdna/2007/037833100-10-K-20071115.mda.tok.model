critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles and the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company s management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 
management believes the company s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments  warranty costs  stock based compensation  income taxes  and legal and other contingencies 
management considers these critical policies because they are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and operating results  and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters 
the company s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company s board of directors 
revenue recognition net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware  software  music products  digital content  peripherals  and service and support contracts 
the company recognizes revenue for software products operating system software and applications software  or any product that is considered to be software related in accordance with the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf no 
 applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software  eg  mac computers  ipod portable digital music players and iphone pursuant to american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended 
for products that are not software or software related  eg  digital content sold on the itunes store and certain mac  ipod and iphone supplies and accessories the company recognizes revenue pursuant to sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped  and title and risk of loss have been transferred 
for most of the company s product sales  these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped 
for online sales to individuals  for some sales to education customers in the us  and for certain other sales  the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit 
if at the outset of an arrangement the company determines the arrangement fee is not  or is presumed not to be  fixed or determinable  revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
during  the company began shipping apple tv and iphone 
for both apple tv and iphone  the company indicated it may provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of charge to customers 
therefore  sales of apple tv and iphone handsets are recognized under subscription accounting in accordance with sop no 
the company recognizes the associated revenue and cost of goods sold on a straight line basis over the currently estimated month economic lives of these products with any loss recognized at the time of sale 
costs incurred by the company for engineering  sales  marketing and warranty are expensed as incurred 
the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs  including reseller and end user rebates  and other sales programs and volume based incentives 
for transactions involving price protection  the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded  provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
if refunds cannot be reliably estimated  revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses 
for customer incentive programs  the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered 
the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company s historical experience 
future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered 
additionally  certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs 
if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives  the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue  which would have a negative impact on the company s results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company distributes its products through third party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education  consumer  and commercial customers 
the company generally does not require collateral from its customers  however  the company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk 
in addition  when possible the company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in latin america  europe  asia  and australia by arranging with third party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the company s direct customers 
these credit financing arrangements are directly between the third party financing company and the end customer 
as such  the company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements 
however  considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral  third party flooring arrangements  or credit insurance are outstanding with the company s distribution and retail channel partners 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers 
the company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible 
the company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debt  the general economic environment  the financial condition of the company s distribution channels  and the aging of such receivables 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s financial condition  if the company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer  or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated  the company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts  which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments were made 
inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments 
the company records a write down for inventories of components and products  including third party products held for resale  which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value 
the company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts  product life cycle status  product development plans  current sales levels  and component cost trends 
the personal computer  consumer electronics and mobile communications industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes 
if future demand or market conditions for the company s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory  the company may be required to record additional write downs which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write downs were recorded 
the company accrues reserves for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled 
consistent with industry practice  the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders  supplier contracts  and open orders based on projected demand information 
these commitments typically cover the company s requirements for periods ranging from to days 
if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company s products  the company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded 
warranty costs the company provides for the estimated cost for hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates  historical and projected cost per claim  and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company s typical experience 
each quarter  the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary 
for products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to sop no 
 the company recognizes warranty expense as incurred 
if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the company s results of operations 
the company periodically provides updates to its applications and system software to maintain the software s compliance with specifications 
the estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty cost that is recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized 
factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered  the number of updates expected to occur  and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
the bsm model requires various judgmental assumptions including expected volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
income taxes the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income  including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies  together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities  will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets 
in the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 
legal and other contingencies as discussed in part i  item of this form k under the heading legal proceedings and in note commitments and contingencies in notes to consolidated financial statements  the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
the company records a contingent liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
in management s opinion  the company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results 
however  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty 
should the company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period  the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected

the company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margins of the personal computer  consumer electronics and mobile communication industries will be subject to pressure due to price competition 
the company expects gross margin percentage to decline sequentially in the first quarter of primarily as a result of the full quarter impact of product transitions and reduced pricing that were effected in the fourth quarter of  lower sales of ilife and iwork in their second quarter of availability  seasonally higher component costs  and a higher mix of indirect sales

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and foreign currency risk management the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions  both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures 
however  given the effective horizons of the company s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures  there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
interest rate risk while the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world s leading industrialized countries  the company s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates 
as such  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  the value of those investments  as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges 
the company s short term investment policy and strategy is to ensure the preservation of capital  meet liquidity requirements  and optimize return in light of the current credit and interest rate environment 
a portion of the company s cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the company s investment policy and to an objective market benchmark 
the company s internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance  allowing for differences in liquidity needs 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company places its short term investments in highly liquid securities issued by highly rated issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company s general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
all highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents  highly liquid investments with initial maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are classified as short term investments 
as of september   billion of the company s short term investments had underlying maturities ranging from to years 
the remainder all had underlying maturities of less than months 
the company may sell its investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes  in anticipation of credit deterioration  or for duration management 
the company recognized net gains before taxes on short term investments of approximately  in and net losses before taxes of approximately  and  in and  respectively 
to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company s investment portfolio  the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve 
based on investment positions as of september   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio 
as of september   a similar basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio 
such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 
foreign currency risk in general  the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect the company s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars 
there is also a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities  certain firmly committed transactions  forecasted future cash flows  and net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
generally  the company s practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures 
however  the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality  prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures  and or limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments 
to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company s foreign currency derivative positions  the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value at risk var model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates 
the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate  random market price paths 
the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value  for a given confidence interval  to the company s foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates 
the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
the model assumes normal market conditions 
forecasted transactions  firm commitments  and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model 
based on the results of the model  the company estimates with confidence a maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september  compared to a maximum one day loss of million as of september  because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes  losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 
actual future gains and losses associated with the company s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september  due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates  foreign currency exchanges rates  and the company s actual exposures and positions
