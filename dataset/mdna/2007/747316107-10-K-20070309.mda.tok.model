item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary quaker chemical corporation is a worldwide developer  producer  and marketer of chemical specialty products and a provider of chemical management services cms for various heavy industrial and manufacturing applications around the globe  with significant sales to the steel and automotive industries 
the improved results largely reflect the continued execution of the company s actions taken throughout in response to its challenging business environment 
the revenue growth in was primarily due to increased selling prices  as well as higher volume in china 
higher selling prices  combined with improved cms profitability  offset higher raw material and third party finished product costs  resulting in significantly higher gross margin dollars with only a slight improvement in gross margin as a percentage of sales as compared to raw material costs  primarily crude oil derivatives  continued to increase during compared to the prior year  mitigating pricing actions intended to improve gross margins as a percentage of sales 
while oil prices have recently declined from a peak early in the third quarter of  to date  the oil price reductions have not yet resulted in any significant reduction in raw material prices 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased million compared to cost savings from restructuring efforts completed in enabled increased spending in higher growth areas  higher variable compensation and higher professional fees 
earnings per diluted share of represent a considerable improvement over the for the principal factors impacting earnings included a growth in revenues and improved performance from cms 
the company s earnings included a million pre tax charge for restructuring and related activities and a million tax charge attributable to the repatriation of accumulated earnings of its foreign subsidiaries  which were offset in part by million of pre tax income from the sale of property by the company s real estate joint venture and lower minority interest primarily as a result of the company s first quarter acquisition of the remaining interest in its brazilian affiliate 
the company s restructuring efforts are positively impacting the bottom line as resources have been shifted to higher growth areas like china  cms and coatings 
however  any improvements in gross margin as a percentage of sales will depend upon a sustained period of stable or declining raw material costs 
the company remains focused on pursing revenue opportunities  managing its raw material and other costs and pursuing pricing initiatives 
most recently  in the fourth quarter of the company acquired the remaining minority interest in its china affiliate 
notwithstanding the improved performance  the business environment in which the company operates remains challenging 
while demand in china is expected to continue to remain strong  volume in other markets was limited by customer end market issues  including higher inventory levels in the us steel industry and reduced vehicle sales experienced by some automotive customers  with indications that these conditions would continue for the foreseeable future 
raw material and third party product costs continue to remain higher as compared to the prior year 
in certain instances  the company faces competitive or contractual constraints limiting pricing actions to recover these higher costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates quaker s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon quaker s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires quaker to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  quaker evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer sales incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  property  plant  and equipment  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  restructuring  incentive compensation plans  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
quaker bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the 
table of contents circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
quaker believes the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements accounts receivable and inventory reserves and exposures quaker establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of quaker s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
as part of its terms of trade  quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and or may ship product on a consignment basis 
further  a significant portion of quaker s revenues is derived from sales to customers in the us steel industry  where a number of bankruptcies have occurred during recent years 
in recent years  certain large industrial customers have also experienced financial difficulty 
when a bankruptcy occurs  quaker must judge the amount of proceeds  if any  that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process 
these matters may increase the company s exposure should a bankruptcy occur  and may require writedown or disposal of certain inventory due to its estimated obsolescence or limited marketability 
reserves for customers filing for bankruptcy protection are generally established at of the amount outstanding at the filing date  dependent on the company s evaluation of likely proceeds from the bankruptcy process 
large and or financially distressed customers are generally reserved for on a specific review basis while a general reserve is established for other customers based on historical experience 
the company s consolidated allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
further  the company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of million  million and million in  and respectively 
an increase of to the recorded provisions would have decreased the company s pre tax earnings by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
environmental and litigation reserves accruals for environmental and litigation matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
accrued liabilities are exclusive of claims against third parties and are not discounted 
environmental costs and remediation costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life  increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of the property from the date acquired or constructed  and or mitigate or prevent contamination in the future 
estimates for accruals for environmental matters are based on a variety of potential technical solutions  governmental regulations and other factors  and are subject to a large range of potential costs for remediation and other actions 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in determining the most likely estimate within the range  and the factors determining this judgment may vary over time 
similarly  reserves for litigation and similar matters are based on a range of potential outcomes and require considerable judgment in determining the most probable outcome 
if no amount within the range is considered more probable than any other amount  the company accrues the lowest amount in the range in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
an inactive subsidiary of the company is involved in asbestos litigation 
if the company ever concludes that it is probable it will be liable for any of the obligations of such subsidiary  then it will record the associated liabilities if they can be reasonably estimated 
the company will reassess this situation periodically in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report 
realizability of equity investments quaker holds equity investments in various foreign companies  whereby it has the ability to influence  but not control  the operations of the entity and its future results 
quaker records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions  poor operating results of underlying investments  or devaluation of foreign currencies could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value 

table of contents these factors may result in an impairment charge in the future 
the carrying amount of the company s equity investments at december  was million and was comprised of three investments totaling million  million and million  respectively 
tax exposures and valuation allowances quaker records expenses and liabilities for taxes based on estimates of amounts that will be ultimately determined to be deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions 
the filed tax returns are subject to audit  often several years subsequent to the date of the financial statements 
disputes or disagreements may arise during audits over the timing or validity of certain items or deductions  which may not be resolved for extended periods of time 
quaker establishes reserves for potential tax audit and other exposures as transactions occur and reviews these reserves on a regular basis  however  actual exposures and audit adjustments may vary from these estimates 
quaker also records valuation allowances when necessary to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while quaker has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event quaker were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should quaker determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made which could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
us income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries since it is the company s intention to continue to reinvest these earnings in those subsidiaries for working capital needs and growth initiatives 
us and foreign income taxes that would be payable if such earnings were distributed may be lower than the amount computed at the us statutory rate due to the availability of foreign tax credits 
restructuring liabilities restructuring charges may consist of charges for employee severance  rationalization of manufacturing facilities and other items 
in  quaker recorded restructuring and other exit costs  including involuntary termination of certain employees  in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
certain of these items  particularly those involving impairment charges for assets to be sold or closed  require significant estimates and assumptions in terms of estimated sale proceeds  date of sale  transaction costs and other matters  and these estimates can change based on market conditions and other factors 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which nullified eitf issue no 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the principal difference between sfas no 
and eitf relates to its requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for exit costs is recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets are evaluated in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
intangible assets  which do not have indefinite lives  are recorded at fair value and amortized over a straight line basis based on third party valuations of the assets 
goodwill and intangible assets  which have indefinite lives  are no longer amortized and are required to be assessed at least annually for impairment 
the company compares the assets fair value to their carrying value primarily based on future discounted cash flows in order to determine if an impairment charge is warranted 
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance 
assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning 
the actual cash flows could differ from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance  and economic conditions 
the company completed its annual impairment assessment as of the end of the third quarter  and no impairment charge was warranted 
the company s consolidated goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the 
table of contents company s assumption of weighted average cost of capital and estimated future net operating profit after tax nopat are particularly important in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred 
the company currently uses a weighted average cost of capital of and  at september   this assumption would have had to increase by more than percentage points before any of the company s reporting units would fail step one of the sfas no 
impairment analysis 
further  at september   the company s estimate of future nopat would have had to decrease by more than before any of the company s reporting units would be considered potentially impaired 
postretirement benefits the company provides certain pension and other postretirement benefits to employees and retirees 
independent actuaries  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  perform the required valuations to determine benefit expense and  if necessary  non cash charges to equity for additional minimum pension liabilities 
critical assumptions used in the actuarial valuation include the weighted average discount rate  rates of increase in compensation levels  and expected long term rates of return on assets 
if different assumptions were used  additional pension expense or charges to equity might be required

liquidity and capital resources quaker s cash and cash equivalents remained at million at december  and operating and financing activities provided million and million  respectively  which were offset by million of net cash used in investing activities 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million in versus million in the company s higher net income was more than offset by the change in working capital accounts  increased net pension plan contributions and higher restructuring payments in  as a result of the actions taken in the fourth quarter of the change in working capital accounts was largely driven by higher incentive compensation accruals in on higher earnings and the timing of accounts payable in the us and europe in the prior year 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million in compared to million in the primary factors affecting the change in cash flows were higher capital expenditures in for expansion  primarily in asia pacific  and lower payments related to acquisitions  and lower proceeds from the disposition of assets

the venture did not assume any debt or other obligations of the company and the company did not guarantee nor was it obligated to pay any principal  interest or penalties on any of the venture s indebtedness 
the venture renovated certain of the existing buildings at the site  as well as built new office space 
in december  the company entered into an agreement with the venture to lease approximately of the site s available office space for a year period commencing february  with multiple renewal options 
the company believes the terms of this lease were no less favorable than the terms it would have obtained from an unaffiliated third party 
in february  the venture sold its real estate assets to an unrelated third party  which resulted in million of proceeds to the company after payment of the venture s obligations 
the proceeds include a gain of million related to the sale by the venture of its real estate holdings as well as million of preferred distributions 
in december  an inactive subsidiary of the company reached a settlement agreement and release with one of its insurance carriers for million 
the proceeds of the settlement are restricted and can only be used to pay claims and costs of defense associated with this subsidiary s asbestos litigation 
in accordance with the agreement  the subsidiary received million cash in december and the remaining million in december of  which were deposited into an interest bearing account  which earned approximately million in  offset by million of payments in the restrictions regarding the use of proceeds lapse after a period of years 
due to the restricted nature of the proceeds  a corresponding deferred credit was established in other non current liabilities for an equal and offsetting amount  and will remain until the restrictions lapse or the funds are exhausted via payments of claims and costs of defense 
see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net cash flows provided by financing activities were million in compared to a million use of cash in the change was caused primarily by net borrowings in compared to net repayments in the borrowings in were used to fund the company s working capital needs  construction of a new manufacturing 
table of contents and research facility in china  and the fourth quarter acquisition of the remaining interest in the company s china affiliate 
the fourth quarter restructuring actions were funded during in addition  lower distributions were paid to the minority shareholders in due to the acquisition of minority shareholders interests

in september  the company prepaid its senior unsecured notes due in the total amount of principal prepaid was million 
in october  the company entered into a new syndicated multi currency credit agreement that provides for financing in the united states and the netherlands 
this facility enabled the company to consolidate the majority of its short term debt into a longer term facility 
the new facility terminates on september  the new facility allows for revolving credit borrowings in a principal amount of up to million  which can be increased to million at the company s request if lenders agree to increase their commitments and the company satisfies certain conditions 
in general  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at either a base rate or libor rate plus a margin based on the company s consolidated leverage ratio 
the provisions of the agreement require that the company maintain certain financial ratios and covenants  all of which the company was in compliance with as of december  and under its most restrictive covenants  the company could have borrowed an additional million at december  at december  and  the company had approximately million and million outstanding on these credit lines at a weighted average borrowing rate of and  respectively

the company believes that in it is capable of supporting its operating requirements including pension plan contributions  payments of dividends to shareholders  possible acquisition and business opportunities  capital expenditures and possible resolution of contingencies  through internally generated funds supplemented with debt as needed 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
pension and other postretirement plan contributions beyond are not determinable since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension trust assets 
the timing of payments related to other long term liabilities  which consist primarily of deferred compensation agreements  cannot be readily determined due to their uncertainty 
interest obligations on the company s short and long term debt are excluded as the majority of the company s debt is subject to variable interest rates 
amounts in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total and beyond short term debt long term debt capital lease obligations non cancelable operating leases purchase obligations pension and other postretirement plan contributions other long term liabilities primarily deferred compensation agreements total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents operations cms discussion during  the company expanded its approach to its chemical management services cms channel consistent with the company s strategic imperative to sell customer solutions value not just fluids 
prior to this change  the company effectively acted as an agent whereby it purchased chemicals from other companies and resold the product to the customer at little or no margin and earned a set management fee for providing this service 
therefore  the profit earned on the management fee was relatively secure as the entire cost of the products was passed on to the customer 
the approach taken in was dramatically different 
the company began entering into new contracts under which it receives a set management fee and the costs that relate to those management fees were and are largely dependent on how well the company controls product costs and achieves product conversions from other third party suppliers to its own products 
this approach came with new risks and opportunities  as the profit earned from the management fee is subject to movements in product costs as well as the company s own performance 
the company believes this expanded approach is a way for quaker to become an integral part of our customers operational efforts to improve manufacturing costs and to demonstrate value that the company would not be able to demonstrate as purely a product provider 
under this alternative pricing structure  the company was awarded a series of multi year cms contracts primarily at general motors powertrain  daimlerchrysler and ford manufacturing sites in   and this business was an important step in building the company s share and leadership position in the automotive process fluids market and has positioned the company well for penetration of cms opportunities in other metalworking manufacturing sites 
this alternative approach had a dramatic impact on the company s revenue and margins 
under the traditional cms approach  where the company effectively acts as an agent  revenues and costs from these sales are reported on a net sales or pass through basis 
as discussed above  the alternative structure is different in that the company s revenue received from the customer is a fee for products and services provided to the customer  which are indirectly related to the actual costs incurred 
as a result  the company recognizes in the alternative structure in reported revenues the gross revenue received from the cms site customer  and in cost of goods sold  the third party product purchases  which substantially offset each other until the company achieves significant product conversions 
as some contracts have been renewed or renegotiated  some of the contracts reverted to a pass through basis 
currently  the company has a mix of contracts with both the traditional product pass through structure and fixed priced contracts covering all services and products 
the company s offerings will continue to include both approaches to cms depending on customer requirements and business circumstances 
comparison of with net sales for were million  up from million for the increase in net sales was attributable to higher sales prices and volume growth 
volume growth was mainly attributable to market share growth and increased demand in the us and china offset by softening demand in europe 
selling price increases were broadly implemented across all regions and market segments to offset significantly higher raw material costs 
gross profit net sales less cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales was for  as compared to for higher selling prices and a stronger performance from the company s cms channel helped maintain margins notwithstanding continued increases in raw material prices  particularly crude oil derivatives 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for increased million compared to cost savings from restructuring efforts completed in enabled increased spending in higher growth areas  higher variable compensation  and higher professional fees

the company records valuation allowances when necessary to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
however  in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its us net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be a non cash charge to income in the period such determination were made  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
the continued upward pressure in the prices for the company s crude oil based raw materials has negatively impacted us profitability 
the company continues to closely monitor this situation as it relates to its net deferred tax assets and the assessment of valuation allowances 
the company is continuing to evaluate alternatives that could positively impact taxable income 
the decrease in minority interest expense for the year is due to the acquisition of the remaining interest in the company s brazilian affiliate in march of  the fourth quarter acquisition of the remaining interest in the company s china affiliate  and lower financial performance from most of the company s minority affiliates

these forward looking statements are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions about us and our operations that are subject to change based on various important factors  some of which are beyond our control 
a major risk is that the company s demand is largely derived from the demand for its customers products  which subjects the company to uncertainties related to downturns in a customer s business and unanticipated customer production shutdowns 
other major risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  significant increases in raw material costs  worldwide economic and political conditions  foreign currency fluctuations  and terrorist attacks such as those that occurred on september   each of which is discussed in greater detail in item a of this report 
furthermore  the company is subject to the same business cycles as those experienced by steel  automobile  aircraft  appliance  and durable goods manufacturers

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quaker is exposed to the impact of interest rates  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in commodity prices  and credit risk 
interest rate risk 
quaker s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its short and long term debt 
most of quaker s debt is negotiated at market rates 
accordingly  if interest rates rise significantly  the cost of debt to quaker will increase 
this can have an adverse effect on quaker  depending on the extent of quaker s borrowings 
as of december   quaker had approximately million in borrowings under its credit facilities at a weighted average borrowing rate of approximately 
the company uses derivative financial instruments primarily for the purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company does not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
in 
table of contents and  the company entered into five interest rate swaps in order to fix a portion of its variable rate debt 
the swaps had a combined notional value of million and million and a fair value of and million at december  and december   respectively 
the counterparties to the swaps are major financial institutions 
see the information included under the caption derivatives in note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report and is incorporated herein by reference 
in february  the company completed a refinancing of its existing industrial development bonds to fix the interest rate of an additional million of debt 
foreign exchange risk 
a significant portion of quaker s revenues and earnings is generated by its foreign operations 
these foreign operations also hold a significant portion of quaker s assets and liabilities 
all such operations use the local currency as their functional currency 
accordingly  quaker s financial results are affected by risks typical of global business such as currency fluctuations  particularly between the us dollar  the brazilian real  the chinese renminbi and the eu euro 
as exchange rates vary  quaker s results can be materially affected 
the company generally does not use financial instruments that expose it to significant risk involving foreign currency transactions  however  the size of non us activities has a significant impact on reported operating results and the attendant net assets 
during the past three years  sales by non us subsidiaries accounted for approximately to of consolidated net annual sales 
in addition  the company often sources inventory among its worldwide operations 
this practice can give rise to foreign exchange risk resulting from the varying cost of inventory to the receiving location as well as from the revaluation of intercompany balances 
the company mitigates this risk through local sourcing efforts 
commodity price risk 
many of the raw materials used by quaker are commodity chemicals  and  therefore  quaker s earnings can be materially affected by market changes in raw material prices 
in certain cases  quaker has entered into fixed price purchase contracts having a term of up to one year 
these contracts provide for protection to quaker if the price for the contracted raw materials rises  however  in certain limited circumstances  quaker will not realize the benefit if such prices decline 
credit risk 
quaker establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of quaker s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
downturns in the overall economic climate may also exacerbate specific customer financial issues 
a significant portion of quaker s revenues is derived from sales to customers in the us steel industry  where a number of bankruptcies occurred during recent years 
in recent years  certain large industrial customers have also experienced financial difficulty 
when a bankruptcy occurs  quaker must judge the amount of proceeds  if any  that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process 
in addition  as part of its terms of trade  quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and or may ship product on a consignment basis 
these practices may increase the company s exposure should a bankruptcy occur  and may require writedown or disposal of certain inventory due to its estimated obsolescence or limited marketability 
customer returns of products or disputes may also result in similar issues related to the realizability of recorded accounts receivable or returned inventory
