items management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and and a 
results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are an integrated energy company operating principally in the united states with two major business groups retail services and wholesale energy 
we report for our business groups in the following financial segments business group financial segment retail services group electric utility electric and gas utility wholesale energy group oil and gas power generation coal mining energy marketing our retail services group currently consists of our electric utility  black hills power  and our electric and gas utility  cheyenne light  which was acquired january  black hills power generates  transmits and distributes electricity to approximately  customers in south dakota  wyoming and montana 
cheyenne light serves approximately  electric customers and  natural gas customers in cheyenne  wyoming and vicinity 
our wholesale energy group  which operates through black hills energy and its subsidiaries  engages in the production of natural gas  crude oil and coal primarily in the rocky mountain region  the production of electric power through ownership of a diversified portfolio of generating plants and the sale of electric power and capacity primarily under long term tolling contracts  and the marketing of natural gas and crude oil 
industry overview the us energy industry experienced another year of strong economic performance in energy commodity prices continued to be high and volatile 
domestic energy prices continue to be influenced by global factors  including foreign economic growth  especially in china and asia  domestic economic growth  the policies of opec and other large foreign oil producers  and political tensions and conflict in many regions 
mild weather dominated the us during the summer of and through early winter  reducing demand for fuel used for power generation and heating 
at year end  domestic supplies of natural gas in storage were well above historical averages 
progress in the energy industry in included the discovery of substantial oil and gas reserves in the gulf of mexico  increased exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the lower states  continued planning and construction of liquefied natural gas port facilities  the proposal of additional coal fired and nuclear power plants  the advancement of renewable energy resources and utilization 
the industry has also experienced better cooperation between regulators and energy providers in many states seeking cooperative  constructive solutions to ongoing issues and rate cases 
the energy industry continues to adjust to change  including the trends of consolidation in the electric and gas utility sectors  increased private equity investment  and asset divestitures to narrow business strategies 
the energy market place is still adjusting to the repeal of puhca  effective in early  increased oversight of the ferc and increased environmental and emissions reviews and mandates 
in recent years  several state regulatory agencies allowed electric utilities to construct and operate power plants in vertically integrated structures after years of discouraging or prohibiting such activity 
as a result  the independent and merchant power industry was challenged in its ability to increase its market presence 
in the past year  the corporate structure of many energy companies underwent evaluation and change  largely from efforts to create additional shareholder value 
some companies are contemplating or implementing a realignment of assets  reflecting shifts in longer term business strategies 
others are divesting certain energy properties to focus on core businesses  such as exiting unregulated power production or oil and gas production in favor of utility operations 
others continue to engage in mergers and acquisitions in a quest to improve economies of scale and returns to investors 
many industry analysts expect an increase in capital investments across a wide spectrum of energy companies 
a number of electric and gas utilities need to replace aging plants and equipment  and regulators are providing favorable recognition in rates for additional investment 
oil and gas producers are expected to continue to increase capital spending in response to relatively high prices 
in response to relatively high seasonal supplies of natural gas and widening regional price differentials capital spending in certain producing areas may moderate or even be curtailed 
in  the domestic coal industry benefited from a stronger price environment  in large part due to high and volatile natural gas prices 
coal prices have moderated recently in response to a trend of lower overall natural gas prices  compared to a year ago 
some deliveries of powder river basin coal in wyoming were hampered by transportation disruptions  causing temporary difficulties for utilities in the west and midwest 
fossil fuel combustion continues to be a contentious domestic and international public policy issue  as many nations  including us allies  advocate reductions in carbon dioxide emission 
many states now encourage the industry to invest in renewable energy resources  such as wind power or the use of bio mass as a fuel 
in some instances  renewable energy use is mandated by state regulators 
in the case of california  a new adopted interim standard requires that future imports of power must come from power plants with lower emission levels than currently associated with conventional coal fired plants 
such restrictions could alter transmission flow of power in western states  as a large percentage of current power generation in the western grid comes from coal sources 
despite these longer term challenges  the power generation industry continues to make improvements in emissions control in response to regulatory mandates 
emissions from new coal fired plants are a fraction of those produced by power plants built a generation ago 
as a result  coal remains an important  domestically available  and economical national energy resource that is vital to meet growing energy demand 
energy providers  government authorities and private interests continue to address longer term issues concerning electric transmission  power generation capacity  the use of renewable and other diversified sources of energy  oil and natural gas pipelines and storage  and other infrastructure related matters 
despite public and private efforts to promote conservation  the demand for energy is expected to increase steadily over time 
business strategy we are a customer focused integrated energy company 
our business is comprised of retail utility assets  including electric and gas distribution systems  fuel assets and electric generation assets 
to optimize the value of our assets  we utilize our energy marketing and transportation expertise 
our focus on customers  whether retail utility customers  wholesale generation or marketing customers  provides opportunities to expand our businesses 
our balanced  integrated approach to retail utility operations  fuel production  power generation and energy marketing is supported by disciplined risk management practices 
the diversity of our operations reduces reliance on any single business to achieve our strategic objectives 
our diversity is expected to provide a measure of stability to our business and financial performance during volatile or cyclical periods 
it helps us reduce our total corporate risk  and allows us to achieve stronger returns over the long term 
the strength and stability of our balance sheet is critical in today s market 
access to capital  sufficient liquidity and quality of earnings are our key drivers 
our long term strategy is to continue expanding our core retail utility  fuel asset and generation businesses  supplemented by our energy marketing operations 
we will do this primarily by focusing on providing superior economic and performance value to customers  and by increasing our customer base 
in the retail area  we seek to grow our existing utility asset base through construction of new rate based generation facilities  and by adding new customers through the acquisition of additional retail utility properties  while maintaining our high customer service and reliability standards 
in the fuel production area  we will continue to develop our existing inventory of oil and gas reserves while striving to maintain our positive relationships with mineral owners and regulatory authorities and working to develop additional markets for our coal production  including the development of additional power plants at our mine site 
our power generation business will focus on long term contractual relationships with key wholesale customers  as well as new customers that will allow us to expand existing generation sites  or to construct or acquire new generation facilities 
the expertise of our energy marketing business will continue to enable us to optimize the value of our asset based businesses 
the following are key elements of our business strategy operate our lines of business as retail and wholesale energy components 
the retail utility component consists of electric and natural gas products and services 
the wholesale component consists of fuel production  mid stream assets  power production facilities and energy marketing  expand retail operations through selective acquisitions of electric and gas utilities consistent with our regional focus and strategic advantages  invest in  construct and expand our rate base generation to serve our electric utilities  complete our proposed acquisition of certain aquila owned utility assets and successfully integrate and profitably operate our expanded utility operations  grow our reserves and increase our production of natural gas and crude oil  grow our energy marketing operations primarily through the expansion of producer and end use origination services and  as warranted by the market  natural gas and crude oil storage and transportation opportunities  selectively grow our power generation segment by developing and acquiring power generating assets in targeted western markets and  in particular  by expanding generating capacity of our existing sites through a strategy known as brownfield development  increase earnings from our coal production through an expansion of mine mouth generation and increased coal sales  exploit our fuel cost advantages and our operating and marketing expertise to produce and sell power at attractive margins  diligently manage the risks inherent in energy marketing  conduct business with a diversified group of creditworthy or sufficiently collateralized counterparties  sell a large percentage of our capacity and energy production from our independent power projects through mid and long term contracts primarily to load serving utilities in order to secure a stable revenue stream and attractive returns  and build and maintain strong relationships with wholesale power customers 
operate our lines of business as retail and wholesale energy components 
the retail component consists of electric and natural gas products and services 
the wholesale component consists of fuel production  mid stream assets  power production facilities and energy marketing 
we achieve operating efficiencies through our retail and wholesale business groups 
in the retail group  the integration of customer service and marketing and promotional efforts streamline operating processes and improve productivity 
in the wholesale group  the fuel production  generation and marketing segments integrate balanced  yet diverse strategic operations 
expand retail operations through selective acquisitions of electric and gas utilities consistent with our regional focus and strategic advantages 
for more than years  we have provided strong retail utility services  based on delivering quality and value to our customers 
our tradition of accomplishment is expected to support efforts to expand our retail operations in other markets  most likely in the midwest  west and in regions that permit us to take advantage of our intrinsic competitive advantages  such as baseload power generation  system reliability  superior customer service and relationship based approach to regulatory matters 
the january acquisition of cheyenne light and the february announcement of the proposed acquisition of certain electric and gas utility assets of aquila are examples of such expansion efforts 
retail operations also enhance other important business development  including gas transmission pipelines and storage infrastructure  which could promote other wholesale operations 
regulated retail utility operations can contribute substantially to the stability of our long term cash flows  earnings and dividend policy 
invest in  construct and expand our rate base generation to serve our electric utilities 
our company s original business was a vertically integrated electric utility 
this business model remains a core strength today  where we are investing in and operating efficient power generation resources to transmit and distribute electricity to our customers 
we provide power at reasonable and stable rates to our customers and earn solid returns for our investors 
rate based generation assets offer several advantages for consumers  regulators and investors 
first  they assure consumers that rates have been reviewed and approved by government authorities who safeguard the public interest 
second  regulators participate in a planning process where long term investments are designed to match long term energy demand 
third  investors are assured that a long term  reasonable  stable rate of return may be earned on their investment 
a lower risk profile may also improve credit ratings which  in turn  can benefit both consumers and investors  by lowering our cost of capital 
we continue to advance our strategy as evidenced by the construction of wygen ii and the development and permitting of wygen iii 
construction of the mw  coal fired wygen ii plant is currently on schedule 
cost of the plant is currently expected to be approximately million  including interim financing costs during construction 
we expect to file a rate case in the first quarter of to recover the cost of wygen ii 
in early  we received a regulatory issued air permit for the wygen iii power plant 
this enables us to move forward with other regulatory processes with the goal of commencing construction in late or early complete our proposed acquisition of certain aquila owned utility assets and successfully integrate and profitably operate our expanded utility operations 
our recently announced definitive agreement to acquire aquila s utility properties in five states will significantly increase our regional presence and the size and scope of our utility operations 
we believe that the expanded utility operations will enhance our ability to serve customers and communities and build value for our shareholders 
in addition to other customary conditions  the completion of the transaction requires us to obtain state and federal regulatory approvals  and pass federal antitrust review 
we will also need to access the capital markets to secure capital sufficient to fund our acquisition 
this could be impacted by our ability to maintain our investment grade issuer credit rating 
we expect that the acquisition will result in multiple benefits 
we will strive to integrate our current and acquired utility operations to achieve these anticipated benefits 
grow our reserves and increase production of natural gas and crude oil 
our strategy is to increase both reserves and production through a combination of drilling and acquisitions 
primary emphasis will be placed on developing our existing core properties located in the san juan  piceance and powder river basins 
specifically  we plan to substantially increase our natural gas reserves primarily by focusing our operations on lower risk development and exploration drilling on our existing properties  maintain working interests with other similar scale operators to provide exposure to additional producing basins  exploit opportunities based on our belief that the long term demand for natural gas will remain strong by emphasizing natural gas in our drilling activities and acquisitions  add natural gas reserves and increase production by focusing primarily on various gas plays in the rocky mountain region  where the added production can be integrated with our existing oil and natural gas operations as well as our fuel marketing and or power generation activities  and support the future capital requirements of our drilling program by stabilizing cash flows with a hedging program that mitigates commodity price risk for a substantial portion of our established production for up to years in the future 
grow our energy marketing operations primarily through the expansion of producer and end use origination services and  as warranted by the market  natural gas and crude oil storage and transportation opportunities 
our energy marketing business seeks to provide services to producers and end users of natural gas  and to capitalize on market volatility by utilizing storage  transportation and proprietary trading positions 
the service provider focus of our energy marketing activities largely differentiates us from other energy marketers 
through our producer services group we assist mostly small to medium sized producers throughout the western us with marketing and transporting their natural gas 
through our wholesale marketing division we work with utilities  municipalities and industrial users of natural gas to provide customized delivery services  as well as to support their efforts to optimize their transportation and storage positions 
we have also added oil marketing within the rocky mountain region to our business portfolio and in the future may seek to construct and or acquire mid stream assets  such as regional pipelines  to facilitate and augment our marketing services 
selectively grow our power generation segment by developing and acquiring power generating assets in targeted western markets and  in particular  by expanding generating capacity of our existing sites through a strategy known as brownfield development 
we aim to develop power plants in regional markets based on prevailing supply and demand fundamentals in a manner that complements our existing fuel assets and fuel and energy marketing capabilities 
this approach seeks to capitalize on market growth while managing our fuel procurement needs 
we intend to grow through a combination of disciplined acquisitions and development of new power generation facilities primarily in the western regions where we believe we have the detailed knowledge of market fundamentals and competitive advantage to achieve attractive returns 
our emphasis is on small scale buildouts to serve incremental growth and improve likelihood of permitting and siting 
we believe that existing sites with opportunities for brownfield expansion generally offer the potential for greater returns than development of new sites through a greenfield strategy 
brownfield sites typically offer several competitive advantages over greenfield development  including proximity to existing transmission systems  operating cost advantages related to ownership of shared facilities  a less costly and time consuming permitting process  and potential ability to reduce capital requirements by sharing infrastructure with existing facilities at the same site 
we expanded our capacity with brownfield development at our valmont and wyodak sites in  arapahoe and las vegas sites in and our wyodak site in we believe that our wyodak and harbor sites in particular provide further opportunities for significant expansion of our gas and coal fired generating capacity over the next several years 
increase earnings from our coal production through an expansion of mine mouth generation and increased coal sales 
our primary strategy is to expand our coal production through the construction of mine mouth coal fired generation plants at our wrdc coal mine location 
our objective is to develop coal production operations to serve our mine mouth coal fired generation plants directly 
we also plan to pursue future sales of coal to additional regional rail served and truck served customers 
exploit our fuel cost advantages and our operating and marketing expertise to produce and sell power at attractive margins 
we expect to selectively expand our portfolio of power plants having relatively low marginal costs of producing energy and related products and services 
as an increasing number of gas fired power plants are brought into operation  we intend to utilize a low cost power production strategy  together with access to coal and natural gas reserves  to protect our revenue stream 
low marginal production costs can result from a variety of factors  including low fuel costs  efficiency in converting fuel into energy  and low per unit operation and maintenance costs 
we aggressively manage each of these factors with the goal of achieving very low production costs 
our primary competitive advantage is our coal mine  which is located in close proximity to our retail service territories 
we are exploiting the competitive advantage of this native fuel source by building additional mine mouth coal fired generating capacity 
this strengthens our position as a low cost producer since transportation costs often represent the largest component of the delivered cost of coal 
diligently manage the risks inherent in energy marketing 
our energy marketing operations require effective management of price and operational risks related to adverse changes in commodity prices and the volatility and liquidity of the commodity markets 
to mitigate these risks  we have implemented risk management policies and procedures for our marketing operations 
we have oversight committees that monitor compliance with our policies 
we also limit exposure to energy marketing risks by maintaining credit facilities separate from our corporate facility 
conduct business with a diversified group of creditworthy or sufficiently collateralized counterparties 
our operations require effective management of counterparty credit risk 
we mitigate this risk by conducting business with a diversified group of creditworthy counterparties 
in certain cases where creditworthiness merits security  we require prepayment  secured letters of credit or other forms of financial collateral 
we establish counterparty credit limits and employ continuous credit monitoring with regular review of compliance under our credit policy by our executive credit committee that reports to our board of directors 
sell a large percentage of our capacity and energy production from our independent power projects through mid and long term contracts primarily to load serving utilities in order to secure a stable revenue stream and attractive returns 
by selling the majority of our energy and capacity under mid and long term contracts  we believe that we can satisfy the requirements of our customers while earning more stable revenues and greater returns over the long term than we could by selling our energy into the more volatile spot markets 
when possible  we structure long term contracts as tolling arrangements  whereby the contract counterparty assumes the fuel risk 
our goal is to sell a majority of our unregulated power generation under long term  utility commission approved contracts primarily to load serving utilities 
the first of our long term power contracts expires in  and nearly all expire before such arrangements are presently under evaluation for renewal or extension  with or without potential revisions to the basic terms of the existing agreements 
most of the existing contracts have been reviewed by state regulatory agencies 
our power plants  particularly in wyoming  the front range of colorado  las vegas  nevada and long beach  california are sited in regions of moderate to rapid population and load growth  and in advantageous locations with convenient access to both fuel supply and power transmission 
in anticipation of renewal or extension  a contract review process generally begins about two years in advance of expiration  and we would expect to proceed with preliminary planning accordingly 
build and maintain strong relationships with wholesale power customers 
we strive to build strong relationships with utilities  municipalities and other wholesale customers  who we believe will continue to be the primary providers of electricity to retail customers in a deregulated environment 
we further believe that these entities will need products  such as capacity  in order to serve their customers reliably 
by providing these products under long term contracts  we are able to meet our customers energy needs 
through this approach  we also believe we can earn more stable revenues and greater returns over the long term than we could by selling energy into more volatile spot markets 
prospective information we expect long term growth through the expansion of integrated  balanced and diverse energy operations 
we recognize that sustained growth requires continual capital deployment 
we are strategically positioned to take advantage of opportunities to acquire and develop energy assets consistent with our investment criteria and a prudent capital structure 
retail services group electric utility business at our electric utility  black hills power  remained strong in we believe that black hills power will produce modest growth in revenue  and absent unplanned plant outages  it will continue to produce stable earnings for the next several years 
we forecast firm energy sales in our retail service territory to increase over the next years at an annual compound growth rate of approximately one percent  with the system demand forecasted to increase at a rate of two percent 
these forecasts are derived from studies we conducted whereby we examined and analyzed our service territory to estimate changes in the needs for electrical energy and demand over a year period 
these forecasts are only estimates  and the actual changes in electric sales may be substantially different 
weather deviations can also affect energy sales significantly when compared to forecasts based on normal weather 
the portion of the utility s future earnings that will result from wholesale off system sales will depend on many factors  including regulatory requirements  native load growth  plant availability and electricity demand and commodity prices in not only our service territory  but in the surrounding power markets as well 
on june   black hills power filed an application with the sdpuc for an electric rate increase to be effective january  on december   the sdpuc approved a rate increase of percent along with the addition of tariff provisions which provide for the automatic adjustment of rates  effective january  the cost adjustments would require the electric utility to absorb a portion of power cost increases  depending in part on earnings from certain short term wholesale sales of electricity 
absent certain conditions  the order also restricts black hills power from requesting an increase in base rates that would go into effect prior to january  the previous rate structure  in place since  did not contain fuel or purchased power adjustment clauses and only provided the ability to request rate relief from energy costs in certain defined situations 
south dakota retail customers account for approximately percent of the electric utility s total retail revenues 
electric and gas utility we acquired cheyenne light on january  we requested and received approval from the wpsc for a rate increase that went into effect on january  we are on schedule with construction of wygen ii  a mw baseload coal fired power plant 
the plant will be a regulated asset of cheyenne light 
the facility is currently expected to cost approximately million  including interim financing costs during construction 
this power plant is expected to be in commercial operation by the end of and will require a rate review with the wpsc in order to recover capital and provide a return on invested capital 
presently  power is provided by psco under an all requirements contract  which expires december  in addition  cheyenne light entered into a year contract to purchase supplemental power of up to mw of renewable wind power  beginning in  pending regulatory and other approvals 
we expect system demand in the cheyenne  wyoming vicinity over the next years to increase at an annual compound rate of approximately two percent 
pending acquisition on february   we announced an agreement with aquila to purchase utility assets 
if completed  the acquisition will dramatically increase the size and scope of our retail services group 
through the transaction  we will acquire aquila s one regulated electric utility in colorado and their regulated gas utilities in colorado  kansas  nebraska and iowa 
the transaction would add approximately  new utility customers  electric customers and  gas customers to our current customer base 
wholesale energy group oil and gas we expect that earnings from this segment over the next few years will be driven primarily by increased oil and gas production 
our long term compounded annual production growth target is percent 
near term growth will come from development of our acquisitions in the piceance basin and the ongoing development of the san juan and piceance basins 
we expect to deploy approximately million of capital in developing our current properties 
we will continue our focus on optimal deployment of capital as drilling and completion costs are expected to continue to rise due to persistent shortages in the industry 
our drilling program is focused on both proved reserves and the further delineation of existing fields  including development of additional locations in the san juan basin resulting from an approved increased density order received on january  we are also encouraged by recent approvals on our non operated properties in montana and oklahoma 
these approvals provide high confidence drilling opportunities in areas of well developed gathering infrastructure 
energy marketing we expect lower earnings from this segment in  as earnings were stronge due to advantageous market conditions 
continued market volatility will enable us to extract economic value as we look to expand our business 
we will continue to focus on producer  end use origination  and gas storage and transportation services and a regional wholesale marketing strategy 
this will be done while maintaining our conservative credit management and lower risk profile that emphasizes short term physical transactions 
power generation we expect higher earnings from our power generation segment in primarily as a result of satisfactorily resolving maintenance issues in at our las vegas facility 
in january  the las vegas ii plant was taken off line for diagnosis and initiation of repairs of both of its heat recovery steam turbine generators 
we restored this plant s capacity and energy availability as of july at the las vegas i power plant  an extensive maintenance program initiated in the fourth quarter of was completed in april there were no major maintenance issues in the last six months of and contracted fleet plant availability was percent during this period 
coal mining production from the coal mining segment is expected to primarily serve mine mouth plant generation and select regional customers with long term fuel needs 
assuming no significant coal fired plant outages  we expect increased earnings from higher production rates  even though operating costs will increase due to higher equipment and labor costs  resulting from higher overburden ratios and increased production 
increased demand will come from additional mine mouth generation either currently being constructed or in the permitting stages of development 
a contract to provide coal to the dave johnston power plant expires in we currently have a put option to sell additional coal to the plant through and have begun to negotiate a possible contract renewal 
recent corporate events on february   we completed the sale of approximately million shares of common stock at a price of per share  to certain institutional investors through a private placement offering 
the company used the proceeds  net of issuance costs  for debt reduction 
results of operations consolidated results results for the year reflect solid utility performance  strong energy marketing results and improved power generation performance 
results for the year also reflect the impacts of scheduled and unscheduled plant outages and lower natural gas prices 
earnings for black hills power increased percent over the prior year 
plant availability for black hills power was percent  despite scheduled and unscheduled plant outages at the wyodak plant 
cheyenne light results reflect a rate increase  effective january   and a full year of operations 
construction of the mw coal fired wygen ii plant is on schedule and expected to be in commercial service by january  strong earnings from energy marketing are attributable to a million increase in realized marketing margins  partially offset by a million loss in unrealized mark to market losses 
daily average physical gas volumes marketed increased percent over this segment also commenced oil marketing operations in the rocky mountain region beginning in may power generation improved earnings for as the las vegas plants were returned to normal operations after extensive repairs and maintenance for scheduled and unscheduled outages 
this segment had contracted fleet power plant availability of over percent for the year  despite the plant outages 
the earnings decline for the oil and gas segment is primarily due to lower average prices received for gas and increased loe and depletion costs 
production was bcfe for the year  a percent increase over fourth quarter production  on a bcfe basis  increased percent over the fourth quarter of reflecting our successful drilling efforts  primarily in the san juan basin 
this increased production trend is expected to continue with production from the san juan basin augmented by increased production from the piceance basin  which was acquired in year end oil and gas reserves were lower than expected as price and technical performance issues affected the year end calculation 
coal mining earnings decreased due to increased overburden expense resulting from a change in accounting  and higher mineral taxes  partially offset by increased revenues resulting primarily from a higher average price received

electric operating expenses increased percent for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
higher operating expenses were primarily the result of an million increase in fuel and purchased power costs 
the increase in fuel and purchased power was due to a million increase in purchased power  which includes million of additional purchased power costs to cover the outage of neil simpson ii  as well as a percent increase in average price per mw hour  and a percent increase in mw hours purchased 
fuel costs increased million due to a percent increase in average cost  partially offset by a percent decrease in mw hours generated 
mw hours produced through coal fired generation decreased while higher cost gas generation was utilized in purchased power and gas generation were utilized for firm load demand and peaking needs due to unscheduled plant outages and warmer weather 
the increase in operating expense was also affected by increased power marketing legal expense  compensation costs and corporate allocations  partially offset by lower maintenance costs due to scheduled and unscheduled plant maintenance in income from continuing operations decreased million primarily due to increased fuel and purchased power costs  legal expense  compensation costs and corporate allocations  partially offset by increased revenues  lower maintenance costs  lower interest expense due to the pay down of debt  and a million benefit from a deferred tax adjustment

the following is a summary of our proved oil and gas reserves at december bbls of oil in thousands mmcf of natural gas total mmcf equivalents these reserves are based on reports prepared by ralph e 
davis associates  inc  an independent consulting and engineering firm 
reserves were determined using constant product prices at the end of the respective years 
estimates of economically recoverable reserves and future net revenues are based on a number of variables  which may differ from actual results 
the estimate takes into account production  the acquisition of approximately bcfe  additions of approximately bcfe and revisions to previous estimates of bcfe 
the downward revision to previous estimates was primarily due to lower than expected results from certain segments of the drilling program in the san juan basin  and to a lesser extent  well performance at certain areas within our finn shurley field 
the decrease in natural gas and oil prices as of december  compared to december  also contributed to the revision 
reserves reflect year end pricing held constant for the life of the reserves  as follows oil gas oil gas oil gas year end prices nymex year end prices avg wellhead compared to revenues from oil and gas increased percent for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  gas volumes sold increased percent due to increased production from recently completed wells and property acquisitions 
oil volumes sold increased percent due to increased drilling activity in the finn shurley field  partially offset by increased federal royalties deducted as a result of expiring royalty relief on stripper wells 
average natural gas price received  net of hedges and exclusive of gas liquids  for the year ended december  was mcf compared to mcf in the same period of average oil price received  net of hedges  for the year ended december  was bbl compared to bbl in the same period of lease operating expense increased percent primarily due to generally higher field service costs experienced industry wide and new san juan compression costs  the east blanco amine plant costs and operating costs associated with compression and gas treatment for the piceance basin properties 
the loe mcfe for the year increased percent to from mcfe in depletion expense per mcfe increased percent over the prior year to mcfe in from mcfe in the average depletion rate per mcfe is a function of capitalized costs  future development costs and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented 
the increased rate is primarily a reflection of higher industry wide drilling and completion costs that significantly increased our estimated future development costs in addition to increased costs from acquisitions and lower reserve estimates 
on march   we acquired certain oil and gas assets of koch exploration company  llc 
the assets include approximately bcfe of proved reserves  including approximately bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves which are substantially all gas  and associated midstream and gathering assets 
in addition  on august  we acquired from a third party most of the remaining working interests associated with these properties 
this includes approximately bcfe of proven reserves  of which bcfe are proved undeveloped reserves 
the associated acreage position is located in the piceance basin in colorado 
compared to revenues from oil and gas increased percent for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  gas volumes sold increased percent due to increased production from recently completed wells  and oil volumes sold decreased percent primarily due to a normal decline in our mature wyoming oil field and reduced enhanced oil recovery activities 
average natural gas price received  net of hedges and exclusive of gas liquids  for the year ended december  was mcf compared to mcf in the same period of average oil price received  net of hedges  for the year ended december  was bbl compared to bbl in the same period of lease operating expense increased percent primarily due to generally higher field service costs experienced industry wide and the increase in number of producing wells as a result of the current drilling program 
the loe mcfe for the year decreased percent from mcfe in to mcfe in due to higher production rates and efficiencies realized in certain of our fields where significant production increases have been achieved 
depletion expense per mcfe excluding liquids increased percent over the prior year from mcfe in to mcfe in the average depletion rate per mcfe is a function of capitalized costs  future development costs and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented 
the increased rate is primarily a reflection of higher industry wide drilling and completion costs that significantly increased our estimated future development costs in addition to lower than expected reserve estimates

the following table provides certain operating statistics for the power generation segment independent power capacity mw of independent power capacity in service contracted fleet plant availability gas fired plants coal fired plants total compared to revenues for the year ended december  decreased percent from the same period in lower revenues are primarily due to scheduled and unscheduled outages for repair and maintenance at the las vegas i and las vegas ii facilities  partially offset by higher capacity revenue at our harbor facility due to a three year  year round tolling agreement  which commenced april  and replaced a seasonal contract 
operating expenses for the year ended december  decreased million from the same period in  primarily due to lower variable operating costs and the receipt of million of insurance proceeds relating to the las vegas ii power plant outage  lower variable costs at the las vegas i power plant due to lower fuel costs and depreciation expense  and the million impairment charge on the las vegas i power plant  a million impairment of goodwill relating to certain power fund investments and a million charge related to a fuel contract termination 
the decrease in operating expense was partially offset by increased repair and maintenance expense  net of insurance proceeds  incurred by the las vegas ii power plant due to the outage 
income from continuing operations increased million  primarily due to the decrease in operating expense partially offset by an million after tax decrease in earnings from certain power fund investments and increased interest expense due to higher interest rates 
in addition  results were impacted by a million charge for a tax adjustment 
plant availability of our contracted fleet was affected by the planned maintenance at las vegas i and unplanned outages at las vegas ii 
the availability of the remainder of our gas fired fleet was approximately percent and availability of our wygen i coal fired plant exceeded percent 
compared to revenues for the year ended december  were flat compared to revenues in the same period in increased revenues at our las vegas ii facility and increased revenues from higher mw generated at our gillette ct were offset by decreased revenues from las vegas i  due to a plant maintenance outage 
in the twelve months of  our las vegas ii facility sold capacity and energy to npc under a long term tolling arrangement  which became effective april   as opposed to selling power into the market on a merchant basis for the first three months of  only when it was economic to do so 
operating expenses for the year ended december  increased million  due primarily to a million impairment charge on the las vegas i plant  a million impairment of goodwill relating to certain power fund investments  increased fuel costs at our gillette ct  a million charge related to a fuel contract termination and increased corporate allocations 
the increase in operating expenses was partially offset by a reduction in fuel expense at the las vegas ii facility  which incurred fuel costs in the first three months of  before the new long term tolling arrangement took effect and lower fuel expense at las vegas i due to planned maintenance in the fourth quarter of income from continuing operations decreased million  primarily due to the million after tax impact of the las vegas i impairment charge  a fuel contract termination charge and increased corporate allocations and tax adjustments that lowered earnings by million  partially offset by a million after tax increase in earnings from certain power fund investments 
plant availability of our contracted fleet was affected by the planned maintenance at las vegas i and unplanned outages at las vegas ii

coal mining coal mining results were as follows in thousands revenue operating expenses operating income income from continuing operations the following table provides certain operating statistics for the coal mining segment thousands of tons tons of coal sold coal reserves compared to revenue from our coal mining segment increased percent for the year ended december  compared to primarily due to higher average prices received 
tons of coal sold were flat with the prior year as increased train load out sales were offset by decreased sales to the wyodak power plant due to scheduled and unscheduled outages 
operating expenses increased percent for the year ended december  primarily due to increased overburden expense resulting from a change in accounting rules requiring overburden removal to be expensed as incurred  higher depreciation expense and increased mineral taxes  partially offset by lower general and administrative costs 
income from continuing operations decreased percent primarily due to the increased mining costs partially offset by the increase in revenues 
compared to revenue from our coal mining segment increased percent for the year ended december  compared to in  the company reached a tax settlement with the wyoming department of revenue which resulted in a million reduction in revenues and a corresponding reduction in mineral taxes in september  the company also recorded an additional million decrease to mineral taxes and million decrease to interest expense related to the settlement 
revenues were also impacted by a percent decrease in tons of coal sold  primarily due to unscheduled plant outages at the neil simpson ii and wyodak power plants  offset by higher average prices 
operating expenses increased percent for the year ended december  primarily due to the reduction of mineral tax expense due to the recording of the tax settlement and increased transportation and overburden removal costs and compensation expense and corporate allocations  partially offset by decreased depletion expense  due to lower depletion rates 
income from continuing operations decreased percent primarily due to increased transportation and overburden removal costs and compensation expense and corporate allocations  partially offset by the decrease in depletion expense 
in addition  results were affected by a million benefit from an income tax reserve adjustment and a million after tax benefit from the wyoming tax settlement 
energy marketing our energy marketing company produced the following results in thousands revenue realized gas marketing gross margin unrealized gas marketing gross margin realized oil marketing gross margin unrealized oil marketing gross margin operating expenses operating income income from continuing operations the following table provides certain operating statistics for the energy marketing segment natural gas physical sales mmbtu crude oil physical sales bbls compared to income from continuing operations increased million primarily due to higher natural gas marketing margins and a percent increase in physical gas volumes marketed as well as the addition of margins from oil marketing operations beginning in may realized gross margins from natural gas marketing for the year ended december  increased million over the same period in the prior year 
gas marketing unrealized mark to market losses for the year ended december  were million higher than the same period in operating expenses increased percent for the year ended december  compared to the same period in primarily due to increased compensation costs related to higher realized marketing margins and an increase in bad debt provision partially offset by lower professional fees as compared to costs incurred in related to litigation involving class action lawsuits alleging false reporting of natural gas price and volume information see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for further discussion of legal proceedings regarding these class action lawsuits 
in march  we sold the operating assets of our houston  texas based crude oil marketing and transportation business 
beginning with the first quarter of  the operations of this business were classified as discontinued operations 
crude oil marketing revenues and cost of sales were presented on a gross basis in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the united states 
accordingly  the classification to discontinued operations had a significant affect on our consolidated presented revenues and cost of sales 
for the years ended december  and  revenues from crude oil marketing and transportation were million and million  and related cost of sales were million and million  respectively 
subsequent to the sale of the crude oil marketing and transportation assets  enserco  our natural gas marketing subsidiary  began marketing crude oil in the rocky mountain region out of our golden  colorado offices 
our primary strategy involves executing physical crude oil purchase contracts with producers  and reselling into various markets 
these transactions are primarily entered into as back to back purchases and sales  effectively locking in a marketing fee equal to the difference between the sales price and the purchase price  less transportation costs 
under sfas  mark to market accounting for the related commodity contracts in our back to back strategy results in an acceleration of marketing margins locked in for the term of the contracts 
these are generally short term contracts with automatic renewals if there is no notice of cancellation 
for discussion of potential volatility in energy marketing earnings related to accounting treatment of certain hedging activities at our natural gas and oil marketing operations  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
compared to income from continuing operations increased million primarily due to higher natural gas marketing margins and volumes and a positive foreign tax credit reserve adjustment of million 
these items were partially offset by a charge for a litigation settlement accrual of million relating to a class action lawsuit  initiated in  that alleged false reporting of natural gas price and volume information 
gas marketing unrealized mark to market gains for the year ended december  were million higher than unrealized mark to market losses for the same period in we expected approximately million of the unrealized mark to market gain to reverse in in addition  realized gross margins from natural gas marketing increased million 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee 
the following discussion of our critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with note  business description and summary of significant accounting policies of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate for impairment  the carrying values of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles  whenever indicators of impairment exist and at least annually for goodwill as required by sfas for long lived assets with finite lives  this evaluation is based upon our projections of anticipated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges from the assets being evaluated 
if the sum of the anticipated future cash flows over the expected useful life of the assets is less than the assets carrying value  then a permanent non cash write down equal to the difference between the assets carrying value and the assets fair value is required to be charged to earnings 
in estimating future cash flows  we generally use a probability weighted average expected cash flow method with assumptions based on those used for internal budgets 
although we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect our evaluations 
during the third quarter of  in accordance with our accounting policies  we evaluated for impairment the long lived asset carrying values of our las vegas i power plant 
the evaluation for impairment was prompted by plant operating losses driven by high natural gas prices 
natural gas prices were mmbtu nymex on september   and were forecasted to maintain historically high price levels 
in measuring the fair value of the las vegas i power plant and the resulting impairment charge of approximately million pre tax  we considered a number of possible cash flow models associated with the various probable operating assumptions and pricing for the capacity and energy of the facility 
we then made our best determination of the relative likelihood of the various models in computing a weighted average expected cash flow for the facility 
inclusion of other possible cash flow scenarios and or different weighting of those that were included could have led to different conclusions about the fair value of the plant 
further  the weighted average cash flow method is sensitive to the discount rate assumption 
if we had used a discount rate that was percent higher  the resulting impairment charge would have been approximately million higher 
if the discount rate would have been percent lower  the impairment charge would have been approximately million lower 
during the fourth quarter of  we wrote off goodwill of approximately million  net of accumulated amortization of million  related to partnership equity flips at certain power fund investments 
as these funds follow accounting policies which require their plant investments to be carried at fair value  our goodwill represented an excess investment cost in the funds that was only supported by the value of the potential increased partnership equity 
when the equity flip was triggered by performance thresholds being met  the value of the additional partnership interest was recognized and our related goodwill impaired 
in  an impairment charge of approximately million after tax was recorded to reduce the carrying value of the pepperell plant to its estimated fair value  less cost to sell and is included in income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes on the consolidated statement of income 
full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities we account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method whereby all productive and nonproductive costs related to acquisition  exploration and development drilling activities are capitalized 
these costs are amortized using a unit of production method based on volumes produced and proved reserves 
any conveyances of properties  including gains or losses on abandonments of properties  are treated as adjustments to the cost of the properties with no gain or loss recognized 
net capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues of proved reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties 
this method values the reserves based upon actual oil and gas prices at the end of each reporting period adjusted for contracted price changes 
the prices  as well as costs and development capital  are assumed to remain constant for the remaining life of the properties 
if the net capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling  then a permanent non cash write down is required to be charged to earnings in that reporting period 
although our net capitalized costs were less than the full cost ceiling at december   we can provide no assurance that a write down in the future will not occur depending on oil and gas prices at that point in time 
in addition  we annually rely on an independent consulting and engineering firm to verify the estimates we use to determine the amount of our proved reserves and those estimates are based on a number of assumptions about variables 
we cannot be assured that these assumptions will not differ from actual results 
oil and natural gas reserve estimates estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves are based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the accuracy of any oil and natural gas reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves may also change 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  as we use the unit of production method of calculating depletion expense  the amortization rate of our capitalized oil and gas properties incorporates the estimated units of production attributable to the estimates of proved reserves 
our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling limitation based in large part on the quantity of our proved reserves 
finally  these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures 
the estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves have been reviewed by independent petroleum engineers 
risk management activities in addition to the information provided below  see note risk management activities  of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
derivatives we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas accounting for derivatives under sfas requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and their measurement is at fair value 
we currently use derivative instruments  including options  swaps  futures  forwards and other contractual commitments for both non trading hedging and trading purposes 
our typical non trading hedging transactions relate to contracts we enter into at our oil and gas exploration and production subsidiary to fix the price received for anticipated future production and interest rate swaps we enter into to convert a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
our marketing and trading operations utilize various physical and financial contracts to effectively manage our marketing and trading portfolios 
fair values of derivative instruments and energy trading contracts are based on actively quoted market prices or other external source pricing information  where possible 
if external market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors and pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or commodities  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recorded  and the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
changes in the commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future 
to the extent financial contracts have extended maturity dates  our estimates of fair value may involve greater subjectivity due to the lack of transparent market data available upon which to base modeling assumptions 
counterparty credit risk we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit and tenor limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current financial information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issue that we have identified 
while most credit losses have historically been within our expectations and established provisions  we can provide no assurance that our credit losses will be consistent with our estimates 
pension and other postretirement benefits the determination of our obligation and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on the assumptions used by actuaries in calculating the amounts 
those assumptions  as further described in note of our notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k  include  among others  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels and healthcare costs 
although we believe our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense 
we account for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans under sfas  and sfas requires the recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and recognition of changes in the funded status in other comprehensive income for fiscal years ending after december  effective for fiscal years ending after december   sfas will require the measurement of the funded status of the plan to coincide with the date of the year end statement of financial position 
defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas  changes in pension obligations associated with fluctuations in long term actuarial assumptions may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of the plan participants 
as such  significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded non cash expense related to our pension plans of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
our pension plan assets are held in trust and primarily consist of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual market returns result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods 
likewise  changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase or decrease recorded pension costs 
in selecting an assumed rate of return on plan assets  we consider past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan and weight the returns by applying the assumed rate of return for each asset class to the target allocation for each asset class in the portfolio 
the value of our qualified pension plan assets increased million to million for the plan fiscal year ended september  plan assets earned million in plan assets increased million to million as of september  plan assets earned million in in the recently completed actuarial valuation  for determining our pension expense  our assumed rate of return on plan assets remained at percent 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was percent  percent and percent for the  and plan years  respectively 
the percent assumed rate of return for the plan year was determined based on the following estimated long term investment allocations and asset class returns asset class estimated allocation estimated return weighted average return equity fixed income cash the plan s expected long term rate of return on assets assumption is based upon the weighted average expected long term rate of returns for individual asset classes 
the asset class weighting is determined using the target allocation for each asset class in the plan portfolio 
the expected long term rate of return for each asset class is determined primarily from long term historical returns for the asset class  with adjustments if it is anticipated that long term future returns will not achieve historical results 
the plan s investment policy for targets an allocation of percent us stocks  percent foreign stocks and percent fixed income 
the expected long term rate of return for equity investments was percent for both the and plan years 
for determining the expected long term rate of return for equity assets  the company reviewed interest rate trends and annual    and year returns for the s p index  which were  at december   percent  percent  percent and percent  respectively 
fund management fees were estimated to be percent for s p index assets and percent for other assets 
the expected long term rate of return on fixed income investments was percent  the return was based upon historical returns on year treasury bonds of percent from to and adjusted for recent declines in interest rates 
the expected long term rate of return on cash investments was estimated to be percent  expected cash returns were estimated to be percent below fixed income investments 
the discount rate we utilize for determining benefit obligations and benefit cost is based on high grade bond rates 
the discount rate was percent  percent and percent in  and  respectively  for the pension cost determination 
in the recently completed actuarial valuation  for determining our pension expense  we increased the discount rate to percent 
a percent increase in the discount rate would cause annual pension expense to decrease by approximately million 
during the first quarter of  a contribution of million was made to our pension plans 
based on our recently completed plan forecasts  we expect to make additional cash contributions to our pension plans of million in the fiscal year 
actual pension expense and contributions required will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plan 
we will continue to evaluate all of the actuarial assumptions  generally on an annual basis  including the expected long term rate of return on assets and discount rate  and will adjust the assumptions as necessary 
non qualified pension plans we have various supplemental retirement plans for our key executives 
expenses recognized under the plans were million in  million in and million in the plans are unfunded 
the actuarial assumptions used for our non qualified pension plans are the same as those used for our qualified plan  except for the assumptions for rate of increases in compensation levels 
other postretirement benefits we do not pre fund our other postretirement benefit plans 
our reported costs of providing other postretirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors  including healthcare cost trends  and results from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
as a result of these factors  significant portions of other postretirement benefit costs recorded in any period do not reflect the actual benefits provided to plan participants 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded other postretirement benefit expense of approximately million  million and million  respectively  in accordance with sfas actual payments of benefits to retirees were approximately million in and million in and the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate 
impact on december  accumulated postretirement impact on service change in assumption benefit obligation and interest cost in thousands increase decrease in selecting assumed healthcare cost trend rates  we consider recent plan experience and various short and long term cost forecasts for the healthcare industry 
based on these considerations  the healthcare cost trend rate used by the actuaries to determine our other postretirement benefit expense for expense determination was percent in  decreasing gradually to percent in the healthcare cost trend rate assumption for expense determination was percent in  decreasing gradually to percent in our discount rate assumption for postretirement benefits is consistent with that used in the calculation of pension benefits 
see the defined benefit pension plan discussion above regarding our discount rate assumptions 
contingencies when it is probable that an environmental or other legal liability has been incurred  a loss is recognized when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of the probability and the amount of loss are made based on currently available facts 
accounting for contingencies requires significant judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to potential liability 
our assessment of our exposure to contingencies could change to the extent there are additional future developments  or as more information becomes available 
if actual obligations incurred are different from our estimates  the recognition of the actual amounts could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of deferred tax assets we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized  at currently enacted income tax rates  to reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the amount of deferred tax assets recognized is limited to the amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and provides any necessary valuation allowances as required 
if we determine that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
liquidity and capital resources overview information about our financial position as of december is presented in the following table percentage financial position summary change in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term debt long term debt stockholders equity ratios long term debt ratio total debt ratio our dividend payout ratio at december  was approximately percent 
our dividend payout ratio at december  was approximately percent which is higher than levels over the past years 
based on current expectations for  we expect payout ratios for to be in the range of percent to percent 
in  we expect our beginning cash balance  cash provided from operations  and available credit facilities to be sufficient to meet our normal operating commitments  to pay dividends and to fund a portion of planned capital expenditures 
we would expect to fund a significant portion of any additional investment in power generating facilities with long term debt 
permanent financing to replace a billion bridge facility for our pending acquisition of the aquila utility assets is expected to come from a combination of new equity  mandatory convertible securities  borrowings under unsecured corporate credit facilities  and cash from internal operations 
on february   we completed a private placement common stock offering raising approximately million in net proceeds that were used to repay debt 
cash flow activities in  we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our operating needs  to pay dividends on common stock  to pay our scheduled long term debt maturities and to fund a portion of our property additions 
cash flows from operations increased million from the prior year amount  affected by a million increase in income from continuing operations and by the following a million increase in cash flows from the change in current operating assets and liabilities 
this is primarily driven by changes in net accounts receivable and accounts payable and million more in cash flows due to changes in material  supplies and fuel during the year 
fluctuations in our material  supplies and fuel balances are largely the result of natural gas inventory held by our energy marketing company in the form of storage agreements 
a million increase in deferred income taxes  largely the result of accelerated deductions associated with property  plant and equipment  the tax effect of recognized benefit plan obligations  and higher intangible drilling costs related to increased activity at our oil and gas segment 
higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of million 
a million impairment charge in for the las vegas i power plant included as an expense in  but which did not impact cash flows 
we had cash outflows from investing activities of million  including approximately million for construction expenditures for wygen ii  million for the acquisition of oil and gas assets in the piceance basin in colorado  and expenditures for development drilling of oil and gas properties of approximately million and property  plant and equipment additions in the normal course of business  partially offset by million cash received for the sale of our texas based crude oil marketing and transportation assets 
we had cash inflows from financing activities of million  primarily due to a million increase in borrowings on our revolving bank facility partially offset by the payment of million of cash dividends on common stock  the net payment of million related to the black hills colorado project level debt refinancing and payment of long term debt maturities 
in  we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our operating needs  to pay dividends on common and preferred stock  to pay our scheduled long term debt maturities and to fund a portion of our property additions 
cash flows from operations increased million from the prior year amount  as a million decrease in income from continuing operations was more than offset by the following an million increase related to non cash charges for the impairment of our las vegas i power plant and goodwill at certain power fund investments of million  higher depreciation  depletion and amortization of million  the write off of capitalized project development costs of million  increases related to employee benefit plans of million and increases of regulatory assets of million  primarily related to the cheyenne light acquisition 
a million increase in the change in current operating assets and liabilities 
this is primarily driven by million less being spent on material  supplies and fuel during the year 
fluctuations in our material  supplies and fuel balances are largely the result of natural gas inventory held by our natural gas marketing company in the form of storage agreements 
a million decrease from changes in deferred income taxes  largely the result of decreases in our net deferred tax liability primarily due to impairment charges  net operating losses  depreciation and other plant related differences  and employee benefit plans  partially offset by increases from mining development and oil exploration costs 
we had cash outflows from investing activities of million  primarily for construction expenditures for wygen ii  acquisitions and development drilling of oil and gas properties and property  plant and equipment additions in the normal course of business and the million cash payment related to the acquisition of cheyenne light  partially offset by million cash received for the sale of black hills fibersystems 
we had cash outflows from financing activities of million  primarily due to the repayment of million of project level debt at our fountain valley facility and the payment of cash dividends partially offset by an increase in short term borrowings 
dividends dividends paid on our common stock totaled per share in this reflects an increase in comparison to prior years dividend levels of per share in and per share in all dividends were paid out of operating cash flows 
our three year annualized dividend growth rate was percent 
in february  our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend percent to cents per share 
if this dividend is maintained during  it will be equivalent to per share  an annual increase of cents per share 
the determination of the amount of future cash dividends  if any  to be declared and paid will depend upon  among other things  our financial condition  funds from operations  the level of our capital expenditures  restrictions under our credit facilities and our future business prospects 
liquidity our principal sources of short term liquidity include our cash on hand  our revolving credit facility and cash provided by operations 
as of december  we had approximately million of cash unrestricted for operations and million of credit through a revolving bank facility 
our revolving credit facility can be used to fund our working capital needs and for general corporate purposes 
at december   we had million of bank borrowings outstanding and million of letters of credit issued under this facility  with a remaining borrowing capacity of million 
approximately million of the cash balance at december  was restricted by subsidiary debt agreements that limit our subsidiaries ability to dividend cash to the parent company 
the million revolving bank facility has a five year term  expiring may  the facility contains a provision which allows the facility size to be increased by up to an additional million through the addition of new lenders  or through increased commitments from existing lenders  but only with the consent of such lenders 
the cost of borrowings or letters of credit issued under the facility is determined based on our credit ratings 
at our current ratings levels  the facility has an annual facility fee of basis points  and has a borrowing spread of basis points over the libor which equated to a percent one month borrowing rate as of december  
the above credit facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants such as limitations on the creation of new indebtedness and on certain liens  restrictions on certain transactions and maintenance of the following financial covenants a consolidated net worth in an amount of not less than the sum of million and percent of our aggregate consolidated net income beginning january   a recourse leverage ratio not to exceed to  and an interest expense coverage ratio of not less than to a default under the credit facility may be triggered by events such as a failure to comply with financial covenants or certain other covenants under the credit facility  a failure to make payments when due or a failure to make payments when due in respect of  or a failure to perform obligations relating to debt obligations of million or more 
a default under the credit facility would permit the participating banks to restrict the company s ability to further access the credit facility for loans or new letters of credit  require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans with interest and require the cash collateralization of outstanding letter of credit obligations 
the credit facility prohibits the company from paying cash dividends unless no default or no event of default exists prior to  or would result after  giving effect to such action 
if these covenants are violated and we are unable to negotiate a waiver or amendment thereof  the lender would have the right to declare an event of default  terminate the remaining commitment and accelerate the payment of all principal and interest outstanding 
as of december   we were in compliance with the above covenants 
our consolidated net worth was million at december   which was approximately million in excess of the net worth we are required to maintain under the debt covenant described above 
the long term debt component of our capital structure at december  was percent  our total debt leverage ratio was percent  our recourse leverage ratio was approximately percent and our interest expense coverage ratio was to in addition to the above credit facility  at december   enserco has a million uncommitted  discretionary line of credit to provide support for the purchases of natural gas and crude oil 
the line of credit is secured by all of enserco s assets and expires on may  at december  there were outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility of million  with no borrowing balances on the facility 
our ability to obtain additional financing  if necessary  will depend upon a number of factors  including our future performance and financial results  and capital market conditions 
we cannot be assured that we will be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms or at all

regulated electric and gas utility capital requirements include approximately million for the development of the wygen ii coal fired plant in we continue to actively evaluate potential future acquisitions and other growth opportunities in accordance with our disclosed business strategy 
we are not obligated to a project until a definitive agreement is entered into and cannot guarantee we will be successful on any potential projects 
future projects are dependent upon the availability of economic opportunities and  as a result  actual expenditures may vary significantly from forecasted estimates 
market risk disclosures our activities in the regulated and unregulated energy sector expose us to a number of risks in the normal operations of our businesses 
depending on the activity  we are exposed to varying degrees of market risk and counterparty risk 
we have developed policies  processes  systems  and controls to manage and mitigate these risks 
market risk is the potential loss that might occur as a result of an adverse change in market price or rate 
we are exposed to the following market risks commodity price risk associated with our marketing business  our natural long position with crude oil and natural gas reserves and production  and fuel procurement for certain of our gas fired generation assets  interest rate risk associated with our variable rate credit facilities and our project financing floating rate debt as described in notes and of our notes to consolidated financial statements  and foreign currency exchange risk associated with our natural gas marketing business transacted in canadian dollars 
our exposure to these market risks is affected by a number of factors including the size  duration  and composition of our energy portfolio  the absolute and relative levels of interest rates  currency exchange rates and commodity prices  the volatility of these prices and rates  and the liquidity of the related interest rate and commodity markets 
to manage and mitigate these identified risks  we have adopted the bhcrpp 
these policies have been approved by our executive risk committee and reviewed by our board of directors 
these policies include governance  control infrastructure  authorized commodities and trading instruments  prohibited activities  employee conduct  etc 
the executive risk committee  which includes senior level executives  meets on a regular basis to review our business and credit activities and to ensure that these activities are conducted within the authorized policies 
trading activities natural gas marketing we have a natural gas and crude oil marketing business specializing in producer services  end use origination and wholesale marketing that conducts business in the western and mid continent regions of the united states and canada 
for producer services our main objective is to provide value in the supply chain by acting as the producer s marketing arm for wellhead purchases  scheduling services  imbalance management  risk management services and transportation management 
we accomplish this goal through industry experience  extensive contacts  transportation and risk management expertise  trading skills and personal attention 
our end use origination efforts focus on supplying and providing electricity generators and industrial customers with flexible options to procure their energy inputs and asset optimization services to these large end use consumers of natural gas 
our wholesale marketing activity has two functions support the efforts of producer services and end use origination groups  and marketing and trading third party natural gas and crude oil 
to effectively manage our producer services  end use origination and wholesale marketing portfolios  we enter into forward physical commodity contracts  financial instruments including over the counter swaps and options and storage and transportation agreements 
we conduct our gas marketing business activities within the parameters as defined and allowed in the bhcrpp and further delineated in the gas marketing crpp as approved by the executive risk committee 
monitoring and reporting market risk exposures we use a number of quantitative tools to measure  monitor and limit our exposure to market risk in our natural gas and oil marketing portfolio 
we limit and monitor our market risk through established limits on the nominal size of positions based on type of trade  location and duration 
such limits include those on fixed price  basis  index  storage  transportation and foreign exchange positions and on the aggregate portfolio var 
our market risk limits are monitored by our risk management function to ensure compliance with our stated risk limits 
the risk management function operates independently from our energy marketing group 
the limits are measured and monitored at a minimum each business day and are regularly reported to and reviewed by our executive risk committee 
we measure and monitor the market risk inherent in the natural gas trading portfolio employing var analysis and scenario analysis 
var is a statistical measure that quantifies the probability and magnitude of potential future losses related to open contract positions 
we use scenario analysis to test the impact of extreme moves in both specific delivery points and overall commodity prices on our portfolio value 
in addition to var and scenario analysis  risk management daily activities include scrutinizing positions  assessing changes in daily mark to market and other non statistical risk management techniques 
the contract or notional amounts  terms and mark to market values of our natural gas marketing and derivative commodity instruments at december  and  are set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
the following table provides a reconciliation of the activity in our energy trading portfolio that has been recorded at fair value under a mark to market method of accounting during the year ended december  in thousands total fair value of energy marketing positions marked to market at december   a net cash settled during the year on positions that existed at december unrealized gain on new positions entered during the year and still existing at december  realized gain on positions that existed at december  and were s ettled during the year unrealized loss on positions that existed at december  and still exist at december  total fair value of energy marketing positions marked to market at december   a a the fair value of positions marked to market consists of derivative assets liabilities and natural gas inventory that has been designated as a hedged item and marked to market as part of a fair value hedge  as follows in thousands december  december  net derivative assets liabilities fair value adjustment recorded in material  supplies and fuel on january   the company adopted eitf issue no 
the adoption of eitf resulted in certain energy trading activities no longer being accounted for at fair value  therefore  the above reconciliation does not present a complete picture of our overall portfolio of trading activities and our expected cash flows from those operations 
eitf was superseded by eitf and allowed a broad interpretation of what constituted trading activity and hence what would be marked to market 
eitf took a much narrower view of what trading activity should be marked to market  limiting mark to market treatment primarily to only those contracts that meet the definition of a derivative under sfas at our natural gas marketing operations  we often employ strategies that include derivative contracts along with inventory  storage and transportation positions to accomplish the objectives of our producer services  end use origination and wholesale marketing groups 
except in circumstances when we are able to designate transportation  storage or inventory positions as part of a fair value hedge  sfas does not allow us to mark our inventory  transportation or storage positions to market 
the result is that while a significant majority of our natural gas marketing positions are economically hedged  we are required to mark some parts of our overall strategies the derivatives to market value  but are generally precluded from marking the rest of our economic hedges transportation  inventory or storage to market 
volatility in reported earnings and derivative positions should be expected given these accounting requirements 
at december   we had a mark to fair value unrealized loss of million for our natural gas and crude oil marketing activities 
of this amount  million was current and million was non current 
the sources of fair value measurements were as follows in thousands maturities source of fair value and thereafter total fair value actively quoted ie  exchange traded prices prices provided by other external sources modeled total the following table presents a reconciliation of our energy marketing positions recorded at fair value under gaap to a non gaap measure of the fair value of our energy marketing forward book wherein all forward trading positions are marked to market 
the approach used in determining the non gaap measure is consistent with our previous accounting methods under eitf in accordance with gaap and industry practice  the company includes a liquidity reserve in its gaap marked to market fair value 
this liquidity reserve accounts for the estimated impact of the bid ask spread in a liquidation scenario under which the company is forced to liquidate its forward book on the balance sheet date 
december  december  fair value of our energy marketing positions marked to market in ac cordance with gaap see footnote a above increase in fair value of inventory  storage and transportation positio ns that are part of our forward trading book  but that are not marked to market u nder gaap fair value of all forward positions non gaap liquidity reserve included in gaap marked to market fair value fair value of all forward positions excluding liquidity reserve non gaap activities other than trading oil and gas exploration and production we produce natural gas and crude oil through our exploration and production activities 
our reserves are natural long positions  or unhedged open positions  and introduce commodity price risk and variability in our cash flows 
we employ risk management methods to mitigate this commodity price risk and preserve our cash flows 
we have adopted guidelines covering hedging for our natural gas and crude oil production 
these guidelines have been approved by our executive risk committee and reviewed by our board of directors 
to mitigate commodity price risk and preserve cash flows  we primarily use over the counter swaps and options 
our hedging policy allows up to percent of our natural gas and percent of our crude oil production from proven producing reserves to be hedged for a period up to two years in the future 
our hedging strategy is conducted from an enterprise wide risk perspective  accordingly  we may not externally hedge a portion of our natural gas production when we have offsetting price risk for the fuel requirements of our power generating activities 
the company has entered into agreements to hedge a portion of its estimated  and natural gas and crude oil production 
the hedge agreements in place are as follows natural gas location transaction date hedge type term volume mmbtu day price san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap cig swap cig swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap crude oil location transaction date hedge type term volume bbls month price nymex swap calendar nymex swap calendar nymex swap calendar nymex put calendar nymex swap calendar nymex put calendar the hedge agreements entered into by the company had a fair value of approximately million as of december  power generation we have a portfolio of gas fired generation assets located throughout several western states 
the outputs from most of these generation assets are sold under long term tolling contracts with third parties whereby any commodity price risk is transferred to the third party 
however  we do have certain gas fired generation assets under long term contracts that do possess market risk for fuel purchases 
it is our policy that fuel risk  to the extent possible  be hedged 
since we are long natural gas in our exploration and production segment  we look at our enterprise wide natural gas market risk when hedging at the subsidiary level 
therefore  we may attempt to hedge only enterprise wide long or short positions 
a potential risk related to power sales is the price risk arising from the sale of wholesale power that exceeds our generating capacity 
these short positions can arise from unplanned plant outages or from unanticipated load demands 
to control such risk  we restrict wholesale off system sales to amounts by which our anticipated generating capabilities exceed our anticipated load requirements plus a required reserve margin 
financing activities we engage in activities to manage risks associated with changes in interest rates 
we have entered into floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with our floating rate debt obligations 
at december   we had million of notional amount floating to fixed interest rate swaps  having a maximum term of years 
further details of the swap agreements are set forth in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
on december  and  our interest rate swaps and related balances were as follows in thousands weighted pre tax average maximum accumulated fixed terms non non other interest in current current current current comprehensive pre tax december  notional rate years assets assets liabilities liabilities income loss loss interest rate swaps december  interest rate swaps we anticipate a portion of unrealized income recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income will be realized as increased interest income in based on december  market interest rates  a gain of approximately million would be realized and reported in pre tax earnings during estimated and realized amounts will likely change during as market interest rates change 
at december   we had million of outstanding  variable rate  long term debt of which million was not offset with interest rate swap transactions that effectively convert a portion of the debt to a fixed rate 
a basis point increase in interest rates would cause pre tax interest expense to increase million in the table below presents principal or notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our short term investments and long term debt obligations  including current maturities in thousands thereafter total cash equivalents fixed rate long term debt fixed rate a average interest rate variable rate b average interest rate total long term debt average interest rate a excludes unamortized premium or discount 
b approximately percent of the variable rate long term debt has been hedged with interest rate swaps converting the floating rates to fixed rates with an average interest rate of percent 
credit risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from non performance of contractual obligations by a counterparty 
we have adopted the bhccp that establishes guidelines  controls  and limits to manage and mitigate credit risk within risk tolerances established by the board of directors 
in addition  our executive credit committee  which includes senior executives  meets on a regular basis to review our credit activities and to monitor compliance with the adopted policies 
for our energy marketing  production  and generation activities  we seek to mitigate our credit risk by conducting a majority of our business with investment grade companies  setting tenor and credit limits commensurate with counterparty financial strength  obtaining netting agreements  and securing our credit exposure with less creditworthy counterparties through parental guarantees  prepayments  letters of credit  and other security agreements 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issue that we have identified 
while most credit losses have historically been within our expectations and provisions established  we cannot assure you that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past or that an investment grade counterparty will not default sometime in the future 
at the end of the year  our credit exposure exclusive of retail customers of our regulated utility segments was concentrated primarily with investment grade companies 
approximately percent of our credit exposure was with investment grade companies 
of the remaining percent credit exposure with non investment grade rated counterparties  approximately percent of this exposure was supported through letters of credit or prepayments  and the remaining primarily unsecured 
foreign exchange contracts our natural gas and crude oil marketing subsidiary conducts its business in the united states and canada 
transactions in canada are generally transacted in canadian dollars  which creates exchange rate risk 
to mitigate this risk  we enter into forward currency exchange contracts to offset earnings volatility from changes in exchange rates between the canadian and united states dollars 
at december  and  we had outstanding forward exchange contracts to sell approximately and million canadian dollars  respectively 
at december  and  we also had outstanding forward exchange contracts to purchase approximately million and million canadian dollars  respectively 
these contracts had a fair value of million and million at december  and  and have been recorded as derivative assets liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
all forward exchange contracts outstanding at december  settled by february  new accounting pronouncements see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for information on new accounting standards adopted in or pending adoption
