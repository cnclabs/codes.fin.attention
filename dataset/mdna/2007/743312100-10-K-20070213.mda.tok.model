adoption of sfas r effective december   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires us to measure the grant date fair value of equity awards given to employees in exchange for services and recognize that cost over the period that such services are performed 
prior to adopting sfas r  we accounted for stock based compensation under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
in transitioning from apb to sfas r  we have applied the modified prospective method 
accordingly  periods prior to adoption have not been restated to conform to sfas r and are not directly comparable to periods after adoption 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost recognized in periods after adoption includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  less estimated forfeitures  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r  less estimated forfeitures 
total stock based employee compensation cost of million is reflected in net income for fiscal the total income tax benefit recognized in our statement of operations for fiscal for share based payments was approximately million 
total gross unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock awards amounted to million at november  the shares associated with this unrecognized expense have a weighted average remaining vesting period of years 
for fiscal  total stock based compensation expense  including amounts from the issuance of restricted shares and amounts from stock options using the fair value provisions of sfas r  is estimated to be approximately million 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we presented all excess tax benefits related to stock compensation as cash flows from operating activities in our statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires the cash flows resulting from these excess tax benefits to be classified as cash flows from financing activities when realized 
in fiscal  we received a tax benefit of million from the exercise of stock options  of which million represented excess tax benefits and  as such  was classified as cash flows from financing activities 
for more information about stock based compensation  including valuation methodology  see note of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this form k and critical accounting policies below 

table of contents critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that require the use of significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
for further information regarding the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this form k 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is significant because revenue is a key component affecting results of operations 
in determining when to recognize revenue from a customer arrangement  we are often required to exercise judgment regarding the application of our accounting policies to a particular arrangement 
for example  judgment is required in determining whether a customer arrangement has multiple elements 
when such a situation exists  judgment is also involved in determining whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements exists 
while we follow specific and detailed rules and guidelines related to revenue recognition  we make and use significant management judgments and estimates in connection with the revenue recognized in any reporting period  particularly in the areas described above  as well as collectibility 
if management made different estimates or judgments  material differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue could occur 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
we establish this allowance using estimates that we make based on factors such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  changes in payment patterns  changes to customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
if we used different estimates  or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we would require additional provisions for doubtful accounts that would increase bad debt expense 
goodwill and intangible assets we had goodwill and net intangible assets  primarily purchased technology and customer related  of million at november  we assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we would record an impairment charge if such an assessment were to indicate that the fair value of such assets was less than the carrying value 
judgment is required in determining whether an event has occurred that may impair the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets 
factors that could indicate that an impairment may exist include significant underperformance relative to plan or long term projections  strategic changes in business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in our stock price or in the value of one of our reporting units for a sustained period of time 
we utilize discounted cash flow models or valuation models to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
we must make assumptions about future cash flows  future operating plans  discount rates and other factors in those models 
different assumptions and judgment determinations could yield different conclusions that would result in an impairment charge to income in the period that such change or determination was made 
income tax accounting we had a net deferred tax asset of million at november  we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider scheduled reversals of temporary differences  projected future taxable income  ongoing tax planning strategies and other matters in assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance 
if we were to change our assumptions or otherwise determine that we were unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period that such change or determination was made 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r 
under sfas r  stock based compensation expense reflects the fair value of stock based awards measured at the grant date  is recognized over the relevant service period  and is adjusted each period for anticipated forfeitures 
we estimate the fair value of each stock based award on the measurement date using the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model incorporates assumptions as to stock price volatility  the expected life of options  a risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
many of these assumptions are highly subjective and require the exercise of management judgment 
our management must also apply judgment in developing an estimate of awards that may be forfeited 
if our actual experience differs significantly from our estimates and we 
table of contents choose to employ different assumptions in the future  the stock based compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ materially from that recorded in the current period

 considering the effects of prior years misstatements in current year financial statements sab issued by the sec 
sab requires that companies utilize a dual approach to assessing the quantitative effects of financial statement misstatements

the adoption of sab had no effect on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended november  in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with statement and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  
table of contents disclosure and transition 
fin will not be effective for us until december  because of this timing  we have just begun to evaluate the impact of the adoption of fin on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurement sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands fair value measurement disclosures 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating whether adoption of sfas will have an impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
we have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and have policies limiting  among other things  the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we seek to limit default risk by purchasing only investment grade securities 
our investments have an average remaining maturity of less than two years and are primarily fixed rate instruments 
in addition  we have classified all of our debt securities as available for sale 
this classification reduces the income statement exposure to interest rate risk if such investments are held until their maturity date 
based on a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates  the potential losses in future earnings  reductions in fair value of risk sensitive instruments and reductions in cash flows are immaterial 
we enter into foreign exchange option and forward contracts to hedge certain transactions of selected foreign currencies mainly in europe and asia pacific against fluctuations in exchange rates 
we have not entered into foreign exchange option and forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
we base our accounting policies for these contracts on the designation of the contracts as hedging instruments 
the criteria we use for designating a contract as a hedge include the contract s effectiveness in risk reduction and matching of derivative instruments to the underlying transactions 
we generally recognize market value increases and decreases on the foreign exchange option and forward contracts in income in the same period as gains and losses on the underlying transactions
