restatements in connection with the preparation of the form k  an error in the company s accounting for revenue recognition relating to a particular contract from was identified 
in the fourth quarter of  our uk subsidiary entered into a contract with a new customer 
in  the company recognized all of the license revenue 
in and the first three quarters of  the company recognized services and maintenance revenue based on work performed for the customer 
however  the contract contained a specified upgrade right  which was delivered in the first quarter of according to accounting requirements  a specified upgrade right must be valued using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
the company uses the residual method for recognizing revenue on its software licenses 
in such instances  the accounting rules state that vsoe for a specified upgrade right cannot be determined and therefore  revenue must be deferred until all elements of the arrangement which would include the specified upgrade are delivered 
although the specified upgrade was delivered in the first quarter of  changes in the customer s requirements and subsequent concessions granted by the company in october which included an additional specified upgrade right  further delayed our ability to establish that delivery and acceptance of the license had occurred 
this additional specified upgrade was delivered in the first quarter of accordingly all revenue  including license  service and maintenance should have been deferred until the delivery and acceptance of the final element 
therefore  the company restated its financial statements to defer all license  service and maintenance revenue recognized in relation to this contract in  and the first three quarters of  which was   and  respectively 
the company s policy is to recognize expenses as incurred when revenues are deferred in connection with transactions where vsoe cannot be established for an undelivered element as the company follows the accounting requirements of sop accordingly  all costs associated with the contract were recorded in the period when incurred  which differs from the period in which the associated revenue will be recognized 
all revenue related to this contract is expected to be recognized in the first quarter of  with the exception of certain post contract support revenue totaling  which will be recognized ratably over and all cash related to the transaction   has been received by the company as of december   with the exception of  most of which was received in the first quarter of and the remainder of which is expected to be received early in the second quarter of as a result of this determination  we restated our financial statements and quarterly results of operations unaudited included in this annual report and are in the process of restating the consolidated interim financial statements for the periods contained in our quarterly reports on form q 
the modifications contained in the restated financial statements relate to revenue and deferred revenues 
it affected the elements of cash flow  but did not have any impact to net cash flow from operations as reported in the statements of cash flows 
these restated financial statements reflect a decrease in basic net loss per share of 
for the year ended december  and 
for the year ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in its summary of accounting policies  note  to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted within the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company does not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below  however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgments and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition astea s revenue is principally recognized from two sources i licensing arrangements and ii services and maintenance 
the company markets its products primarily through its direct sales force and resellers 
license agreements do not provide for a right of return  and historically  product returns have not been significant 
astea recognizes revenue on its software products in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and sec staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition 
astea recognizes revenue from license sales when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the license fee is fixed and determinable and the collection of the fee is probable 
we utilize written contracts as a means to establish the terms and conditions by which our products  support and services are sold to our customers 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  which generally occurs after a license key has been delivered electronically to the customer 
revenue for arrangements with extended payment terms in excess of one year is recognized when the payments become due  provided all other recognition criteria are satisfied 
if collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
our typical end user license agreements do not contain acceptance clauses 
however  if acceptance criteria is required  revenues are deferred until customer acceptance has occurred 
astea allocates revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on the elements respective fair value  determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately 
specifically  astea determines the fair value of the maintenance portion of the arrangement based on the price  at the date of sale  if sold separately  which is generally a fixed percentage of the software license selling price 
the professional services portion of the arrangement is based on hourly rates which the company charges for those services when sold separately from software 
if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists  but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
if an undelivered element for which evidence of fair value does not exist  all revenue in an arrangement is deferred until the undelivered element is delivered or fair value can be determined 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
the proportion of the revenue recognized upon delivery can vary from quarter to quarter depending upon the determination of vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of undelivered elements 
the residual value  after allocation of the fee to the undelivered elements based on vsoe of fair value  is then allocated to the perpetual software license for the software products being sold 
when appropriate  the company may allocate a portion of its software revenue to post contract support activities or to other services or products provided to the customer free of charge or at non standard rates when provided in conjunction with the licensing arrangement 
amounts allocated are based upon standard prices charged for those services or products which  in the company s opinion  approximate fair value 
software license fees for resellers or other members of the indirect sales channel are based on a fixed percentage of the company s standard prices 
the company recognizes software license revenue for such contracts based upon the terms and conditions provided by the reseller to its customer 
revenue from post contract support is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is generally twelve months on a straight line basis 
consulting and training service revenue is generally unbundled and recognized at the time the service is performed 
fees from licenses sold together with consulting services are generally recognized upon shipment  provided that the contract has been executed  delivery of the software has occurred  fees are fixed and determinable and collection is probable 
deferred revenue deferred revenue includes amounts billed to or received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
this generally results from post contract support  software installation  consulting and training services not yet rendered or license revenue which has been deferred until all revenue requirements have been met or as services are performed 
unbilled receivables are established when revenue is deemed to be recognized based on the company s revenue recognition policy  but due to contractual restraints  the company does not have the right to invoice the customer 
accounts receivable the company evaluates the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of each quarter 
in performing this evaluation  the company analyzes the payment history of its significant past due accounts  subsequent cash collections on these accounts and comparative accounts receivable aging statistics 
based on this information  along with consideration of the general strength of the economy  the company develops what it considers to be a reasonable estimate of the uncollectible amounts included in accounts receivable 
this estimate involves significant judgment by the management of the company 
actual uncollectible amounts may differ from the company s estimate 
capitalized software research and development costs the company accounts for its internal software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
the company capitalizes software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility through the product s availability for general release 
costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are charged to product development expense 
product development expense includes payroll  employee benefits  and other headcount related costs associated with product development 
software development costs are amortized on a product by product basis over the greater of the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenues or on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the products usually two years  beginning with the initial release to customers 
during the first quarter of  the company reduced the estimated life for its capitalized software products from three years to two years based on current sales trends and the rate of product release 
the company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances had occurred that indicate that the remaining useful life of the capitalized software development costs should be revised or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates the recoverability of capitalized software based on the estimated future revenues of each product 
goodwill part of the purchase price for the fieldcentrix assets  acquired september   included the acquisition of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of september it is also tested between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exists  using a fair value based approach 
no impairment of goodwill has been identified during any of the periods presented 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reportable unit level using a two step approach 
the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying unit  goodwill is not considered impaired and the second step is not required 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  the second step of the impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any  by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the assumptions we used to estimate fair value of goodwill change  there could be an impact on future reported results of operations 
acquired intangible assets acquired intangible assets excluding goodwill are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  or on an interim basis if an event or circumstance occurs between annual tests indicating that the assets might be impaired 
the impairment test will consist of comparing the cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired intangible asset to its carrying amount 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
share based compensation option plans beginning on january   the company began accounting for stock options under the provision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  or sfas r  share based payments  which requires the recognition of the fair value of share based compensation 
the fair value of stock option awards was estimated using a black scholes closed form option valuation model 
this model requires the input of assumptions in implementing sfas r  including expected stock price volatility  expected term and estimated forfeitures of each award 
the parameters used in the model are reviewed and adjusted on a quarterly basis 
we elected the modified prospective method for adoption of sfas r 
prior to the implementation of sfas r  we accounted for stock option awards under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share disclosed in the footnotes to the consolidated condensed financial statements were estimated using a black scholes closed form option valuation model to determine the estimated value and by attributing such fair value over the requisite service period on a straight line basis for those awards that actually vested 
as a result of adopting sfas r  for the year ended december  loss before income taxes and net loss was  higher than if the company had continued to account for share based compensation under apb the basic and diluted loss per share for the year ended december  was greater than if the company had continued to account for share based compensation under apb as of december   the total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested options amounted to  which is expected to be recognized over the options average remaining vesting period of years 
no income tax benefit was realized by the company in the year ended december  as the company reported an operating loss and maintained a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax asset 
the company had a choice of two attribution methods for allocating compensation costs under sfas no 
r the straight line method  which allocates expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the last separately vesting portion of an award  or the graded vesting attribution method  an accelerated amortization method  which allocates expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was in substance  multiple awards 
we chose the graded vesting attribution method and accordingly  amortize the fair value of each option tranche over the respective tranche s requisite service period 
the adoption of sfas r has impacted our consolidated statement of operations through the recognition of share based compensation expenses in cost of services and maintenance  development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
future periods are expected to reflect similar costs 
prior to the adoption of sfas r no stock based compensation cost had been recorded 
with the adoption of sfas r  in order to determine the fair value of stock options costs  the company assumed estimated forfeiture rate of 
forfeiture rates were not reflected in prior year estimates of the fair value of stock options 
as of december   the total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested options granted amounted to  which is expected to be recognized over the options remaining vesting period of years 
no income tax benefit was realized by the company in year ending december  as the company reported an operating loss and maintained a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax asset
