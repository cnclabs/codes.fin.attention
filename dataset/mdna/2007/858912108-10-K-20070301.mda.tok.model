table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item of this report 
introduction we are in the business of managing regulated waste and providing an array of related services 
we operate in the united states  the united kingdom  mexico  canada  ireland  and argentina 
for large quantity generators of regulated waste such as hospitals and for pharmaceutical companies and distributors  we offer our institutional medical waste management services  our bio systems sharps management services to reduce the risk of needle sticks  a variety of products and services for infection control  and our regulated returns management services for expired or recalled health care products 
for small quantity generators of regulated waste such as doctors offices and for retail pharmacies  we offer our medical waste management services  our steri safe occupational safety and health act and health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa compliance programs  a variety of products and services for infection control  and our pharmaceutical returns services for expired or recalled pharmaceuticals 
we operate integrated national medical waste management networks in the united states  canada  mexico  argentina  the united kingdom and ireland 
our national networks include a total of processing or combined processing and collection sites and additional transfer  collection or combined transfer and collection sites 
our medical waste processing technologies include autoclaving  our proprietary electro thermal deactivation system etd  chemical treatment and incineration 
as of december   we served approximately  customers  of which approximately  were small quantity customers and approximately  were large quantity customers 
critical accounting policies and procedures our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note to our consolidated financial statements  the following ones may involve a higher degree of judgment on our part and greater complexity of reporting 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue for our regulated waste services at the time of waste collection 
revenues from regulated returns management services are recorded at the time services are performed 
royalty revenues are calculated based on measurements specified in each contract or license and revenues are recognized at the end of each reporting period when the activity being measured has been completed 
revenues from product sales are recognized at the time the goods are shipped to the ordering customer 
software licensing revenues are recognized on a prorated basis over the term of the license agreement 
revenue and costs on contracts to supply our proprietary etd treatment equipment are recognized based on shipment of equipment and services provided for in the individual contract 
we had no revenues related to etd sales in or we do not have any contracts in a loss position 
losses would be recorded when known and estimable for any contracts that should go into a loss position 
payments received in advance are deferred and recognized as services are provided 
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill associated with the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is not amortized 
we have determined that our permits have indefinite lives and  accordingly are not amortized 
this position is in accordance with statement of financial accounting 
table of contents standards sfas no 
 which became effective for fiscal years beginning after december  see note goodwill and other intangible assets for additional information 
our balance sheet at december  contains goodwill of million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we evaluate on at least an annual basis  using the fair value of reporting units  whether goodwill is impaired 
if we were to determine that a significant impairment has occurred  we would be required to incur non cash write offs of the impaired portion of goodwill that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the write off occurs 
we use the market value of our stock as a measure of fair value and compare that to the ratio of earnings before income tax expense  depreciation expense  and amortization expense  to book value of each of our reporting unit when testing for goodwill impairment  and any unforeseen material drop in our stock price may be an indicator of a potential impairment of goodwill 
the results of the impairment test conducted in june did not show any impairment of goodwill  and no events have occurred since that time that indicate that an impairment situation exists 
our permits are currently tested for impairment annually at december  or more frequently if circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
we use a discounted cash flow model as the current measurement of the fair value of the permits 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by management 
our estimates of discounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  inaccuracies in economic estimates  and actual cash flow could materially affect the future financial value of the permits 
the results of the impairment test did not show any impairment of our permits and no events have occurred since that time that would indicate an impairment situation exists 
other identifiable intangible assets  such as customer lists  tradenames and covenants not to compete  are currently amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we have determined that our regulated waste customer lists have between year and year lives based on the specific type of relationship 
these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be less than the undiscounted cash flows 
there have been no indicators of impairment of these intangibles see note to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
deferred income tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
to provide for certain potential tax exposures  we maintain a reserve for specific tax contingencies  the balance of which management believes is adequate 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities 
accounts receivable balances are determined to be delinquent when the amount is past due based on the contractual terms with the customer 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified among uncollected accounts 
accounts receivable are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when we have determined that the receivable will not be collected and or when the account has been referred to a third party collection agency 
no single customer accounts for more than of our revenues 
insurance 
our insurance for worker s compensation  vehicle liability and physical damage  and employee related health care benefits is obtained using high deductible insurance polices 
a third party administrator is used to process all such claims 
we require all workers compensation  vehicle liability and physical damage claims to be reported within hours 
as a result  we accrue our worker s compensation  vehicle and physical damage liability based upon the claim reserves established by the third party administrator at the end of each reporting period 
our employee health insurance benefit liability is based on our historical claims experience rate 
our earnings would be impacted to the extent that actual claims vary from historical experience 
we review our accruals associated with the exposure to these liabilities for adequacy at the end of each reporting period 
litigation 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and deal with regulatory inquiries or investigations from time to time that may be instituted for a variety of reasons 
we are also involved in a variety of civil litigation from time to time 
settlements from litigation would be recorded when known  probable and estimable 

table of contents stock option plans 
we have issued stock options to employees and directors as an integral part of our compensation programs 
on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method to account for stock compensation costs 
sfas no 
r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to our employees and directors 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating expected volatility  expected term and risk free rate 
our expected volatility is based upon historical experience 
the expected term of the stock options is based upon historical experience 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon the average of the us treasury three and five year yield rates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past
