overview we provide air medical transportation services throughout the united states and design  manufacture  and install medical aircraft interiors and other aerospace and medical transport products 
our divisions  or business segments  are organized according to the type of service or product provided and consist of the following community based model cbm provides air medical transportation services to the general population as an independent service 
revenue consists of flight fees billed directly to patients  their insurers  or governmental agencies  and cash flow is dependent upon collection from these individuals or entities 
in the cbm division generated of our total revenue  compared to in and in hospital based model hbm provides air medical transportation services to hospitals throughout the us under exclusive operating agreements 
revenue consists primarily of fixed monthly fees approximately of total contract revenue and hourly flight fees approximately of total contract revenue billed to hospital customers 
in the hbm division generated of our total revenue  compared to in and in products division designs  manufactures  and installs aircraft medical interiors and other aerospace and medical transport products for domestic and international customers 
in the products division generated of our total revenue  compared to in and in see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for operating results by segment 
we believe that the following factors have the greatest impact on our results of operations and financial condition flight volume 
fluctuations in flight volume have a greater impact on cbm operations than hbm operations because almost all of cbm revenue is derived from flight fees  as compared to approximately of hbm revenue 
by contrast  of our costs primarily associated with flight operations including salaries  aircraft ownership costs  hull insurance  and general and administrative expenses are mainly fixed in nature 
while flight volume is affected by many factors  including competition and the effectiveness of marketing and business development initiatives  the greatest single variable has historically been weather conditions 
adverse weather conditions such as fog  high winds  or heavy precipitation hamper our ability to operate our aircraft safely and  therefore  result in reduced flight volume 
total patient transports for cbm operations were approximately  for compared to approximately  for patient transports for cbm bases open longer than one year same base transports were approximately  in compared to  in cancellations due to unfavorable weather conditions for bases open longer than one year did not change materially over the prior year 
reimbursement per transport 
we respond to calls for air medical transports without pre screening the creditworthiness of the patient and are subject to collection risk on services provided to insured and uninsured patients 
medicare and medicaid also receive contractual discounts from our standard charges for flight services 
flight revenue is recorded net of provisions for contractual discounts and estimated uncompensated care 
both provisions are estimated during the period the related services are performed based on historical collection experience and any known trends or changes in reimbursement rate schedules and payor mix 
the provisions are adjusted as required based on actual collections in subsequent periods 
net reimbursement per transport for cbm and hbm at risk operations is primarily a function of price  payor mix  and timely and effective collection efforts 
both the pace of collections and the ultimate collection rate are affected by the overall health of the us economy  which impacts the number of indigent patients and funding for state run programs  such as medicaid 
medicaid reimbursement rates in many jurisdictions have remained well below the cost of providing air medical transportation 
in addition  the collection rate is impacted by changes in the cost of healthcare and health insurance  as the cost of healthcare increases  health insurance coverage provided by employers may be reduced or eliminated entirely  resulting in an increase in the uninsured population 
we have increased average prices for our cbm operations a total of since march  contributing to an increase of in net reimbursement per transport in compared to provisions for contractual discounts and estimated uncompensated care for cbm operations are as follows caption for years ended december  
del gross billings provision for contractual discounts provision for uncompensated care del 
the increase in the total percentage of uncollectible accounts is primarily attributable to price increases 
although price increases generally increase the net reimbursement per transport from insurance payers  the amount per transport collectible from private patient payers and medicare and medicaid does not increase proportionately with price increases 
therefore  depending upon overall payer mix  price increases will usually result in an increase in the percentage of uncollectible accounts 
although we have not yet experienced increased limitations in the amount reimbursed by insurance companies  continued price increases may cause insurance companies to limit coverage for air medical transport to amounts less than our standard rates 
aircraft maintenance 
both cbm and hbm operations are directly affected by fluctuations in aircraft maintenance costs 
proper operation of the aircraft by flight crews and standardized maintenance practices can help to contain maintenance costs 
increases in spare parts prices from original equipment manufacturers oem s tend to be higher for aircraft which are no longer in production 
five models of aircraft within our fleet  representing of the rotor wing fleet  are no longer in production and are  therefore  susceptible to price increases which outpace general inflationary trends 
in addition  on condition components are more likely to require replacement with age 
since january   we have taken delivery of seventeen new aircraft and have the option to purchase eighteen additional aircraft through the end of we plan to replace discontinued models and other older aircraft with the new aircraft expected to be delivered under these options  as well as to provide capacity for base expansion 
replacement models of aircraft typically have higher ownership costs than the models targeted for replacement but lower maintenance costs 
total maintenance expense for cbm and hbm operations increased from to  while total flight volume for cbm and hbm operations increased over the same period 
the number of engine events  including overhauls  increased approximately during compared to aircraft availability 
the recent high rate of growth in the air medical transportation and other helicopter services industries has generated strong demand for new models of helicopters 
quality used aircraft are also in short supply worldwide 
we have endeavored to mitigate the shortage of suitable aircraft primarily through long term arrangements with a single aircraft manufacturer which provides us options to purchase up to ten aircraft each year for the next several years 
we also have a purchase commitment with another aircraft manufacturer for fifteen aircraft  with deliveries scheduled to begin in  as well as options for an additional fifteen aircraft in future years 
competitive pressures from low cost providers 
we are recognized within the industry for our standard of service and our use of cabin class aircraft 
many of our competitors utilize aircraft with lower ownership and operating costs and do not require a similar level of experience for aviation and medical personnel 
reimbursement rates established by medicare  medicaid  and most insurance providers are not contingent upon the type of aircraft used or the experience of personnel 
however  we believe that higher quality standards help to differentiate our service from competitors and  therefore  lead to higher utilization 
deploying multiple aircraft in a market also serves as a barrier to entry for lower cost providers 
employee recruitment and relations 
the ability to deliver quality services is partially dependent upon our ability to hire and retain employees who have advanced aviation  nursing  and other technical skills 
in addition  hospital contracts typically contain minimum certification requirements for pilots and mechanics 
employees who meet these standards are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource in the foreseeable future 
in september  our pilots voted to be represented by a collective bargaining unit  and we signed a cba on march  the agreement is effective january   through april  significant changes from our previous wage rates or benefits include increases in initial base pay rates  increase in pay for overtime shifts from regular pay rates to times regular pay rates  and changes in our contributions to defined contribution retirement plans 
the cba provides for annual increases in base pay in each year of the agreement 
we recorded approximately  in incremental salary and benefit costs during as a result of implementing the cba provisions 
other employee groups may also elect to be represented by unions in the future 
results of operations year ended december  compared to we reported net income of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  net income for the year ended december   included a loss on early extinguishment of debt of  with a tax effect of approximately 
operating income was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  net reimbursement revenue after provisions for contractual discounts and uncompensated care for cbm operations improved for compared to the prior year  while same base transports for cbm operations increased approximately 
improvement in net reimbursement during was offset in part by increases in the cost of aircraft maintenance and in salaries and benefits  primarily as a result of the implementation of the cba 
flight operations community based model and hospital based model net flight revenue increased  or  from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  flight revenue is generated by both cbm and hbm operations and is recorded net of provisions for contractual discounts and uncompensated care 
cbm net flight revenue increased  or  to  for the following reasons average price increases totaling approximately for all cbm operations since march  including in mid june net reimbursement per transport increased approximately in compared to incremental net revenue of  from the addition of fifteen new cbm bases during either or  and from the provision of air medical transportation services in gulfport  mississippi  in the aftermath of hurricane katrina  pursuant to a contract with the state of mississippi 
closure of five bases during either or  resulting in a decrease in net revenue of approximately  increase of approximately in same base transports in compared to cancellations due to unfavorable weather conditions did not change materially over the prior year 
hbm net flight revenue increased  or  to  for the following reasons incremental revenue of  generated from the addition of two new contracts and the expansion of seven contracts during either or discontinuation of service under two contracts and the conversion of one contract to cbm in  resulting in a decrease in revenue of approximately  annual price increases in the majority of contracts based on changes in the consumer price index or spare parts prices from aircraft manufacturers and the renewal of contracts at higher rates 
decrease of in flight volume for all contracts excluding the new contracts  contract expansions  and the discontinued contracts discussed above 
flight center costs consisting primarily of pilot  mechanic  and medical staff salaries and benefits increased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to changes by business segment were as follows cbm flight center costs increased  or  to  for the following reasons increase of  for the addition of personnel and facilities for the new base locations described above

decrease of approximately  due to the base closures described above 
increase of approximately  in pilot salaries and benefits related to the implementation of the cba effective january  increases in salaries for merit pay raises 
increases in our cost of medical insurance premiums 
aircraft operating expenses increased  or  for the year ended december   in comparison to aircraft operating expenses consist of fuel  insurance  and maintenance costs and generally are a function of the size of the fleet  the type of aircraft flown  and the number of hours flown 
the increase in costs is due to the following addition of helicopters for cbm operations and fifteen for hbm operations during either or  resulting in an increase of approximately  increase of approximately  in fuel costs as a result of the addition of new cbm bases  net of the impact of closed cbm bases 
the addition of new hbm bases and expansion of hbm programs did not have a material impact on fuel costs because hbm customers typically pay for all fuel consumed in medical flights 
increase of approximately in the cost of aircraft fuel per hour flown 
decreases in hull insurance rates effective july and july changes in flight volume for both cbm and hbm as described above 
increases in the number of engine and transmission events  including overhauls 
annual price increases in the cost of spare parts and overhauls  most of which exceeded the rate of inflation 
aircraft rental expense increased  or  for the year ended december   in comparison to the year ended december  incremental rental expense incurred in for leased aircraft added to our fleet during either or totaled  the increase for new aircraft was offset in part by refinancing nine aircraft at lower lease rates during and twelve during and by the buyout of an aircraft under an operating lease during medical interiors and products sales of medical interiors and products decreased  or  from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  in  we completed production of mev litter systems and eleven modular  medical interior kits for commercial customers 
we also continued work on eleven hh l units 
in the fourth quarter  we began production of additional mev units 
revenue by product line for the year ended december   was as follows  multi mission interiors  modular medical interiors  other aerospace and medical transport products in  we completed production of thirteen hh l units and nineteen mev litter systems 
we also began production of eleven additional hh l units and additional mev units 
other significant projects in included production of a multi mission interior for a sikorsky firehawk helicopter for the los angeles county fire department and four modular medical interiors for commercial customers 
revenue by product line for the year ended december   was as follows  multi mission interiors  modular medical interiors  other aerospace and medical transport products cost of medical interiors and products decreased  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the previous year  consistent with the change in sales volume 
the average net margin earned on projects during was compared to in  primarily due to the change in product mix and to efficiencies realized in the manufacturing process for commercial customers 
general expenses depreciation and amortization expense increased  or  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of upgrades to aircraft  engines  and avionics systems and the purchase of rotable equipment and a new dispatch  flight tracking  and medical field data software system and related hardware 
in the third quarter of  we also exercised our purchase option on an aircraft valued at approximately  which had previously been leased under an operating lease 
litigation settlement of  recorded during represents the net amount received in settlement of a lawsuit we filed against a company related to the fatal crash of one of our helicopters in september the amount recorded is net of attorney fees and is related primarily to revenue lost in the nevada cbm program during the period following the accident 
general and administrative g a expenses increased  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  g a expenses include executive management  accounting and finance  billing and collections  information services  human resources  aviation management  pilot training  dispatch and communications  and cbm program administration 
we increased the number of personnel in the billing and collections function due to the increase in flight volume and  in the short term  to accommodate the transition of accounts from the utah billing office to the california billing office 
we also increased staffing in our information services department to support the expanded information technology infrastructure and scheduled software systems upgrades 
in addition  premiums for medical malpractice insurance and directors and officers liability insurance increased in compared to the prior year 
g a expenses were of revenue in compared to of revenue in interest expense decreased  or  for the year ended december   compared to  primarily as a result of regularly scheduled payments of long term debt and decreased borrowings against our line of credit 
the average balance outstanding against the line was approximately million during  compared to million during these decreases were offset in part by new notes and capital lease obligations totaling  originated during with a weighted average interest rate of 
income tax expense was  or of income before taxes  in and  or of income before taxes  in for years prior to  our income tax expense was determined using a federal statutory rate of because we believed that our deferred tax assets and liabilities would be recovered or settled at that rate 
due to an increase in projected taxable income for the year ended december   and for future years  we revised our estimated tax rate to in deferred income tax expense of  was recognized for the year ended december   as a result of applying the new estimated rate to deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the effective tax rate for  excluding the effect of applying the new estimated rate against deferred tax balances  was 
the remainder of the increase in the effective tax rate for compared to was primarily due to an increase in certain permanent book tax differences 
in we changed our year end for income tax filing from june to december to coincide with our fiscal year end and filed a short period return for the six months ended december  the true up of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted in an increase of  to deferred tax liabilities and income tax expense in the effective tax rate for prior to the true up of deferred tax assets and liabilities was 
year ended december  compared to we reported net income of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  net income for the year ended december   included a loss on early extinguishment of debt of  with a tax effect of approximately 
net income for the year ended december   included the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  as discussed more fully below 
operating income was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  growth in operating income for was partly due to an increase in flight volume for cbm and hbm operations  resulting primarily from the opening of new bases or base expansions 
in addition  net reimbursement for cbm operations improved for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
flight operations community based model and hospital based model net flight revenue increased  or  from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  changes by business segment were as follows cbm net flight revenue increased  or  to  for the following reasons average price increases of approximately for all cbm operations effective september  approximately effective march  and approximately effective october incremental net revenue of  generated from the addition of eleven new cbm bases during either or  generated from the provision of air medical transportation services in new orleans  louisiana  and gulfport  mississippi  in the aftermath of hurricane katrina  pursuant to contracts with fema 
closure of three bases during either or  resulting in a decrease in net revenue of approximately  for the year ended december  consistent same base transports 
excluding the impact of the new bases and base closures discussed above  total flight volume for all cbm operations for was unchanged from the prior year 
higher cancellations due to unfavorable weather conditions in the first quarter of  compared to the first quarter of  were offset by milder weather conditions during the remainder of the year 
hbm net flight revenue increased  or  to  for the following reasons incremental net revenue of  generated from the addition of two new contracts and the expansion of nine contracts during either or discontinuation of service under one contract during the first quarter of  resulting in a decrease in net revenue of approximately  in annual price increases in the majority of contracts based on changes in the consumer price index

decrease of approximately  due to the base closure described above 
increases in salaries for merit pay raises 
aircraft operating expenses increased  or  for the year ended december   in comparison to the increase in costs is due to the following addition of helicopters for cbm operations and nine for hbm operations during either or  resulting in an increase in aircraft operating expenses of approximately  increase of  in fuel costs as a result of the addition of new cbm bases  net of the impact of closed cbm bases 
increase of approximately in the cost of aircraft fuel per hour flown 
decrease in hull insurance rates effective july and again in july containment of maintenance costs 
excluding the impact of new aircraft described above  maintenance costs increased approximately in engine upgrades performed in prior periods and standard pricing contracts covering several key components of certain models of aircraft helped to contain operating costs 
in addition  deliveries of new aircraft allowed the company to redeploy some older models into lower utilization markets or into the backup fleet 
approximately fewer engine overhauls were also performed during compared to the prior year  due to normal operating cycles 
aircraft rental expense increased  or  for the year ended december   in comparison to the year ended december  incremental rental expense incurred in for leased aircraft added to our fleet during either or totaled  the increase for new aircraft was offset in part by refinancing twelve aircraft at lower lease rates during medical interiors and products sales of medical interiors and products increased  or  from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  in  we completed production of thirteen hh l units and nineteen mev litter systems

revenue by product line for the year ended december   was as follows  multi mission interiors  modular medical interiors  other aerospace and medical transport products cost of medical interiors and products increased  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the previous year 
the average net margin earned on projects during was compared to in  primarily due to the change in product mix 
the margin earned on multi mission interiors is typically higher than the margins earned on modular medical interiors for commercial customers 
cost of medical interiors and products also includes certain fixed costs  such as administrative salaries and facilities rent  which do not vary with volume of sales and which are absorbed by both projects for external customers and interdivisional projects 
general expenses depreciation and amortization expense increased  or  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of upgrades to aircraft  engines  and avionics systems and the purchase of rotable equipment  a new patient billing software system and related hardware  and office and medical equipment for the new bases described above 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   reflecting an increase in billing and collections and cbm program administration staff and in pilot training costs to manage the growth in our operations 
g a expenses in also include performance bonuses for executive officers and other management personnel 
g a expenses were of revenue in  compared to in interest expense decreased  or  for the year ended december   compared to  partly as a result of regularly scheduled payments of long term debt and decreased borrowings against our line of credit 
the average balance outstanding against the line was approximately million during  compared to million during in addition  in may we repaid million in subordinated debt  which had an effective interest rate of during  with the proceeds of million in term loans which bore interest at an effective rate of approximately during the remainder of the repayment was funded by draws against the line of credit 
loss on early extinguishment of debt for totaled  and related to the repayment of million in subordinated debt in may we wrote off approximately  in debt origination costs and note discount related to the subordinated debt and paid a prepayment penalty of  to the holders of the subordinated debt 
income tax expense was  or of income before taxes  in and  or of income before taxes  in in we changed our year end for income tax filing from june to december to coincide with our fiscal year end and filed a short period return for the six months ended december  the true up of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted in an increase of  to deferred tax liabilities and income tax expense in during  net operating loss carryforwards nol s of million  for which a valuation allowance had previously been established  expired 
based on management s assessment  realization of net deferred tax assets through future taxable earnings is considered more likely than not 
liquidity and capital resources we had working capital of  as of december   compared to  as of december  the change in working capital position is primarily attributable to an increase of  in net trade receivables consistent with increased net revenue for the cbm and hbm divisions and increased net reimbursement for cbm operations 
in addition  at december   we had a receivable for refundable income taxes of  primarily as a result of the prepayment of federal income taxes 
cash requirements debt and other long term obligations the following table outlines our contractual obligations as of december  amounts in thousands caption less than after total year years years years 
del long term debt principal     interest payments total long term debt obligations     capital leases    interest payments total capital lease obligations    operating leases      aircraft purchase commitments total  del 
interest payments include an estimate of variable rate interest on our revolving credit facility and notes with principal balances totaling  as of december  variable interest was estimated using the weighted average rate in effect during for each note and the average balance outstanding against the revolving credit facility during balloon payments on long term debt are due as follows  in  in  in  in  in off balance sheet arrangements residual value guarantees we have entered into various aircraft operating leases under which we provide residual value guarantees to the lessor 
as of december   the undiscounted maximum amount of potential future payments under the guarantees is  no amounts have been accrued for any estimated losses with respect to the guarantees  since it is not probable that the residual value of the aircraft will be less than the amounts stipulated in the guarantee 
the assessment of whether it is probable that we will be required to make payments under the terms of the guarantee is based on current market data and our actual and expected loss experience 
aircraft purchase commitments in july  we entered into a commitment agreement to purchase fifteen bell helicopters for approximately million  beginning in  with a minimum of three deliveries per year 
the agreement provides for special incentives  including a trade in option for up to fifteen bell helicopters  with minimum guaranteed trade in values 
due to delays in the manufacturer s processes  delivery of the first bell helicopter is currently expected in late  with the remaining units to be delivered over approximately the following two and a half years 
in august  we entered into a commitment agreement to purchase six eurocopter ec helicopters for approximately million  with deliveries scheduled in in october  we also entered into a purchase commitment for four eurocopter as helicopters for approximately million 
as of december   we had taken delivery of all aircraft under these agreements 
during  we entered into additional purchase commitments for various models of bell and eurocopter helicopters 
as of december   commitments for aircraft for approximately million are still open 
deliveries under these commitments are expected in and we also have options to enter into additional purchase commitments for future years dependent upon our aircraft requirements 
we intend to use the new aircraft for base expansion opportunities as well as to replace older models of aircraft in our fleet 
we plan to either sell the aircraft which are replaced or redeploy them into the backup fleet 
typically we have financed aircraft acquired under these or similar commitments through operating lease or debt agreements 
as of the first quarter of  we have received financing commitments  subject to routine credit approval and aircraft inspection processes  in excess of the cost of aircraft to be delivered in if financing arrangements cannot be arranged and we are  therefore  prevented from taking delivery of aircraft under the commitments described above  we would forfeit nonrefundable deposits up to of the aircraft value 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain aircraft financing on favorable terms 
at the present  a vibrant secondary market for these models of aircraft exists which may allow us to sell aircraft which are not needed in our operations or which we are unable to finance 
letters of credit in january  we entered into a  letter of credit with an insurance underwriter in lieu of increasing cash deposits on our workers compensation insurance policy 
the letter of credit may be renewed annually and reduces the available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 
sources and uses of cash we had cash and cash equivalents of  at december   compared to  at december  cash generated by operations totaled  in compared to  in net receivable balances increased  in compared to  in  reflecting continued growth in cbm and hbm revenue and an improved net reimbursement rate for cbm operations  as described above 
during we made payments of  for income taxes  compared to  in at december   we had a receivable for refundable income taxes of  primarily as a result of the prepayment of federal income taxes 
cash used for investing activities totaled  in  compared to  in equipment acquisitions in consisted primarily of two used aircraft for a total of approximately million and information systems hardware and software  as well as medical interior and avionics installations 
in  we received million from the sale of land and buildings which had previously served as the headquarters for rocky mountain holdings  llc  prior to the acquisition by the company in and  from the sale of an aircraft no longer needed in our operations 
equipment acquisitions in consisted primarily of rotable equipment  medical and office equipment for new bases  information systems hardware and software  and upgrades to aircraft  engines  and avionics systems 
in we received  in insurance proceeds for an aircraft destroyed in an accident and sold an aircraft previously classified as held for sale for  financing activities generated  in  compared to using  in in we used proceeds from new note agreements to refinance existing debt with higher interest rates and to fund the acquisition of an aircraft 
in  we used million of term loan proceeds and additional draws against our line of credit to fund the early repayment of million in subordinated debt and the related prepayment penalty of  we also paid  in debt issuance costs  primarily associated with the amendment to our senior credit facility in may the other primary use of cash in both and was regularly scheduled payments of long term debt and capital lease obligations 
in we also paid down our line of credit balance by  senior credit facility our senior credit facility consists of  in term loans as of december   and a revolving credit facility 
in october  the revolving credit facility was amended to increase the maximum revolving advance amount from million to million 
the amendment also increased the limitation on annual capital expenditures  inclusive of leased assets  from million to million 
all other terms and conditions of the credit facility remained unchanged 
as of december   we had  outstanding against the million revolving credit facility and available capacity on the facility of  the capacity available on the revolving credit facility is reduced by letters of credit outstanding 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by thirteen aircraft and substantially all of our accounts receivable  inventory  equipment and general intangibles 
indebtedness under the credit facility has a first priority claim to the assets pledged to secure it 
the facility matures december   but can be prepaid at any time  subject to payment of an early termination fee ranging from 
to if the termination occurs prior to december  the revolving loans bear interest  at our option  at either i the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the prime rate as announced by the lenders or ii a rate equal to libor plus an applicable margin ranging from to 
the term loans bear interest  at our option  at either i the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the prime rate as announced by the lenders plus or ii a rate equal to libor plus 
as of december   the interest rate on the outstanding balance against the revolving credit facility was and the interest rate on the term loans was 
payment obligations under the credit facility accelerate upon the occurrence of defined events of default  including the following failure to pay principal or interest or to perform covenants under the credit facility or other indebtedness  events of insolvency or bankruptcy  failure to timely discharge judgments of  or more  failure to maintain the first priority status of liens under the credit facility  levy against a material portion of our assets  default under other indebtedness  suspension of material governmental permits  interruption of operations at any of our facilities that has a material adverse effect  and a change of control in the company 
the credit facility contains various covenants that limit  among other things  our ability to create liens  declare dividends  make loans and investments  enter into real property leases exceeding specified expenditure levels  make any material change to the nature of our business  enter into any transaction with affiliates other than on arms length terms  prepay indebtedness  enter into a merger or consolidation  or sell assets 
the credit facility also places limits on the amount of new indebtedness  operating lease obligations  and unfinanced capital expenditures which we can incur in a fiscal year 
we are required to maintain certain financial ratios as defined in the credit facility and other notes 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility 
new community based operations opening a new community based operation typically requires an investment in an additional aircraft  aviation and medical personnel  and crew quarters 
we may take possession of the additional aircraft up to three months prior to the commencement of operations in order to retrofit the aircraft for medical transport 
staff may also be hired a month in advance of the operation start date 
because of the delay between date of transport and collection of receivables from the patients or their insurers  new community based operations may not produce positive cash flow during at least the first three months of operation 
outlook for the statements contained in this outlook are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
community based model we opened two new bases in the northeast region during the fourth quarter of in the first quarter of  we acquired certain business assets from another air medical service provider in florida  resulting in the addition of two new base locations 
during the first quarter of  we also expect to open three new bases in the southeast and one in the western region 
cbm flight volume at all other locations during is expected to be consistent with historical levels  subject to seasonal  weather related fluctuations 
effective january   we increased prices for our cbm operations an average of approximately 
hospital based model during the fourth quarter of  one of our customers expanded to an additional satellite location and we expect one other contract to open a satellite base in early fifteen hospital contracts are due for renewal in we expect flight activity for continuing hospital contracts to remain consistent with historical levels 
products division as of december   eleven hh l units and mev units for the us army and two commercial medical interiors were in process 
deliveries under all contracts in process are expected to be completed by the third quarter of  and remaining revenue is estimated at million 
the current us army aviation modernization plan defines a requirement for hh l multi mission medevac units in total over an unspecified number of years 
we have already completed hh l units under the program  in addition to the eleven currently in process 
the new contract for mev units completes the current us army requirement for this program 
there is no assurance that orders for additional units will be received in future periods 
all segments there can be no assurance that we will continue to maintain flight volume or current levels of collections on receivables for cbm operations  successfully complete planned expansions of cbm and hbm operations  renew operating agreements for our hbm operations  or generate new profitable contracts for the products division 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  deferred income taxes  and depreciation and residual values 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition fixed flight fee revenue under our operating agreements with hospitals is recognized monthly over the terms of the agreements 
flight revenue relating to patient transports is recognized upon completion of the services and is recorded net of provisions for contractual discounts and estimated uncompensated care 
both provisions are estimated during the period the related services are performed based on historical collection experience and any known trends or changes in reimbursement rate schedules and payor mix 
the provisions are adjusted as required based on actual collections in subsequent periods 
we have from time to time experienced delays in reimbursement from third party payors 
in addition  third party payors may disallow  in whole or in part  claims for reimbursement based on determinations that certain amounts are not reimbursable under plan coverage  determinations of medical necessity  or the need for additional information 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are very complex and subject to interpretation 
we also provide services to patients who have no insurance or other third party payor coverage 
there can be no guarantee that we will continue to experience the same collection rates that we have in the past 
if actual future collections are more or less than those projected by management  adjustments to allowances for contractual discounts and uncompensated care may be required 
based on related flight revenue for the year ended december   a change of basis points in the percentage of estimated contractual discounts and uncompensated care would have resulted in a change of approximately  in flight revenue 
revenue related to fixed fee medical interior and products contracts is recorded as costs are incurred using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we estimate the percentage of completion based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of an estimate of the total costs to complete the project 
losses on contracts in process are recognized when determined 
if total costs to complete a project are greater or less than estimated  the gross margin on the project may be greater or less than originally recorded under the percentage of completion method 
deferred income taxes in preparation of the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciable assets  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recoverable from future taxable income and record a valuation allowance for those amounts we believe are not likely to be realized 
establishing or increasing a valuation allowance in a period increases income tax expense 
we consider estimated future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in statutory tax rates applicable to the company is also recognized in income in the period of the change 
depreciation and residual values in accounting for long lived assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives  projected residual values and the potential for impairment 
estimates of useful lives and residual values of aircraft are based upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and anticipated utilization of the aircraft 
changing market prices of new and used aircraft  government regulations and changes in our maintenance program or operations could result in changes to these estimates 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
new accounting standards in september  the securities and exchange commission staff sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab  financial statements considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  providing guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining whether the current year s financial statements are materially misstated 
sab requires a company to consider the impact of all prior year misstatements reflected in the current year s balance sheet  without consideration of the period in which the misstatement occurred  as well as to consider the amount of the misstatement that occurred in the current year in order to determine the materiality of the misstatement 
sab is effective for years ending after november  the implementation of the guidance in sab had no effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the cumulative effect upon adoption shall be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year 
fin is effective for years beginning after december  we have not yet determined the effect of fin on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
statement  fair value measurements 
statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
it applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements but does not require any new fair value measurements 
statement is effective for years beginning after november  we do not expect implementation of statement to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
all of our product sales and related receivables are payable in us dollars 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and notes receivable  some of which have fixed interest rates  except  outstanding against the line of credit and  in notes payable 
based on the amounts outstanding at december   the annual impact of a change of basis points in interest rates would be approximately  interest rates on these instruments approximate current market rates as of december  periodically we enter into interest rate risk hedges to minimize exposure to the effect of an increase in interest rates 
as of december   we were party to one interest rate swap agreement 
the swap agreement provides that we will pay a fixed interest rate on  of notional principal and receive a floating interest rate libor plus on the same amount of notional principal from the counterparty
