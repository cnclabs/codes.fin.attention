we manage our business as three separate segments an exploration and production segment  a marketing segment and a service operations segment which is comprised of our wholly owned drilling and trucking subsidiaries 
we refer you to note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report  which summarizes by segment our net income and capital expenditures for  and and our assets as of december   and executive summary chesapeake is the third largest independent producer of natural gas in the united states 
we own interests in approximately  producing oil and natural gas wells that are currently producing approximately bcfe per day  of which is natural gas 
our strategy is focused on discovering  developing and acquiring onshore natural gas reserves in the us east of the rocky mountains 
our most important operating area has historically been in various conventional plays in the mid continent region of oklahoma  arkansas  southwestern kansas and the texas panhandle 
at december   of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves were located in the mid continent region 
during the past five years  we have also built significant positions in various conventional and unconventional plays in the fort worth basin in north central texas  the appalachian basin  principally in west virginia  eastern kentucky  eastern ohio and southern new york  the permian and delaware basins of west texas and eastern new mexico  the ark la tex area of east texas and northern louisiana  and the south texas and texas gulf coast regions 
we have established a top three position in nearly every major shale play in the us  including the forth worth basin barnett shale  the arkansas fayetteville shale  the appalachian basin devonian shale  the southeast oklahoma woodford shale  the delaware basin barnett and woodford shales  the illinois basin new albany shale and the conasauga  floyd and chattanooga shales in alabama 
oil and natural gas production for was bcfe  an increase of bcfe  or over the bcfe produced in we have increased our production for consecutive years and consecutive quarters 
during these quarters  chesapeake s us production has increased for an average compound quarterly growth rate of and an average compound annual growth rate of 
in addition to increased oil and natural gas production  the prices we received were higher in than in on a natural gas equivalent basis  weighted average prices excluding the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives were per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in the increase in prices resulted in an increase in revenue of billion  and increased production resulted in an increase in revenue of million  for a total increase in revenue of billion excluding the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives 
in each of the operating areas where chesapeake sells its oil and natural gas  established marketing and transportation infrastructures exist  thereby contributing to relatively high wellhead price realizations for our production 
during  we led the nation in drilling activity with an average utilization of operated rigs and non operated rigs 
through this drilling activity  we drilled   net operated wells and participated in another  net wells operated by other companies 
our success rate was for operated wells and for non operated wells 
to accelerate the development of our extensive prospect inventory  we have increased our current drilling activity to operated rigs and we anticipate keeping our operated rig count between and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements rigs during in  we added approximately  new employees to support our growth  which increased our total employee base to approximately  employees at december   and invested million in leasehold excluding leasehold acquired through corporate and asset acquisitions and d seismic data  all of which we consider the building blocks of future value creation 
chesapeake began with estimated proved reserves of tcfe and ended the year with tcfe  an increase of tcfe  or 
during  we replaced bcfe of production with an estimated tcfe of new proved reserves  for a reserve replacement rate of 
reserve replacement through the drillbit was tcfe  or of production including bcfe of positive performance revisions and bcfe of downward revisions resulting from natural gas price declines between december  and december  and of the total increase 
reserve replacement through the acquisition of proved reserves was bcfe  or of production and of the total increase 
our annual decline rate on producing properties is projected to be from to  from to  from to  from to and from to our percentage of proved undeveloped reserve additions to total proved reserve additions was approximately in  in and in based on our current drilling schedule and budget  we expect that virtually all of the proved undeveloped reserves added in will begin producing within the next three to five years 
generally  proved developed reserves are producing at the time they are added or will begin producing within one year 
chesapeake attributes its strong drilling results and production growth during and in this decade to management s early recognition that oil and natural gas prices were undergoing structural change and its subsequent decision to invest aggressively in the building blocks of value creation in the e p industry people  land and seismic 
during the past five years  chesapeake has significantly strengthened its technical capabilities by increasing its land  geoscience and engineering staff to approximately  employees 
today  the company has approximately  employees  of which approximately work in the company s e p operations and work in the company s oilfield service operations 
since  chesapeake has invested billion in new leasehold and d seismic acquisitions and now owns what it believes to be one of the largest inventories of onshore leasehold million net acres and d seismic million acres in the us on this leasehold  the company has an estimated  net drilling locations representing an approximate year inventory of drilling projects 
chesapeake s direct and indirect drilling rig investments have served as an effective hedge to higher service costs and have also provided competitive advantages in making acquisitions and in developing the company s own leasehold on a more timely and efficient basis 
as of december   chesapeake had invested approximately million to build or acquire drilling rigs and to begin the construction of additional rigs 
during  the company entered into a sale leaseback transaction to monetize its investment in rigs in exchange for cash proceeds of approximately million 
these rigs are under lease to chesapeake through at which time the company has the option to reacquire them 
including the rigs sold and subsequently leased back to chesapeake  the company s drilling rig fleet should reach rigs by mid year  which would rank chesapeake as the sixth largest drilling rig contractor in the us additionally  the company has a million investment in two private drilling rig contractors  dhs drilling company and mountain drilling company  in which chesapeake s equity ownership is approximately and  respectively 
dhs owns rigs and mountain is operating rigs and has another rigs under construction or on order for delivery in to further hedge its exposure to oilfield service costs and achieve greater operational efficiency  in chesapeake invested million to acquire a interest in a privately held provider of well stimulation and high pressure pumping services with operations currently focused in texas principally in the fort worth barnett shale and the rocky mountains 
it also has expansion efforts underway in many other key regions in which chesapeake operates

index to financial statements as of december   the company s debt as a percentage of total capitalization total capitalization is the sum of debt and stockholders equity was compared to as of december  during  we received net proceeds of billion through issuances of million of preferred equity  billion of common equity and billion principal amount of senior notes 
we used the net proceeds from these offerings primarily to fund the purchase price for acquisitions and to repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving bank credit facility 
as a result of our debt transactions in and  we have extended the average maturity of our long term debt to over nine years with an average interest rate of approximately we intend to continue to focus on improving the strength of our balance sheet 
we believe our business strategy and operational performance will lead to an investment grade credit rating for our unsecured debt at some point in the future 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity and uses of funds our primary source of liquidity to meet operating expenses and fund capital expenditures other than for certain acquisitions is cash flow from operations 
based on our current production  price and expense assumptions  we expect our drilling  land and seismic capital expenditures in to exceed our cash flow from operations 
any additional funds required will be provided through additional borrowings under our bank credit facility 
our budget for drilling  land and seismic activities during is currently between billion and billion 
we believe this level of exploration and development will be sufficient to increase our proved oil and natural gas reserves in and increase our total production by to inclusive of acquisitions completed or scheduled to close in through the filing date of this report but without regard to any additional acquisitions that may be completed in 
however  higher drilling and field operating costs  drilling results that alter planned development schedules  acquisitions or other factors could cause us to revise our drilling program  which is largely discretionary 
cash provided by operating activities was billion in  compared to billion in and billion in the billion increase from to and the million increase from to were primarily due to higher realized prices and higher volumes of oil and natural gas production 
we expect that production volumes will be higher than in and that cash provided by operating activities in will exceed levels 
while a decline in natural gas prices in would affect the amount of cash flow that would be generated from operations  we currently have oil swaps in place covering of our expected oil production in at an average nymex price of per barrel of oil and natural gas swaps in place covering of our expected natural gas production in at an average nymex price of per mcf  along with natural gas collars covering of our anticipated natural gas production for with an average nymex floor of per mcf and an average nymex ceiling of per mcf 
additionally  we have written call options covering of our natural gas production at a weighted average price of 
this level of hedging provides certainty of the cash flow we will receive for a substantial portion of our production 
depending on changes in oil and natural gas futures markets and management s view of underlying oil and natural gas supply and demand trends  however  we may increase or decrease our current hedging positions 
based on fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices  our hedging counterparties may require us to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance from time to time 
all but three of our commodity price risk management counterparties require us to provide assurances of performance in the event that the counterparties mark to market exposure to us exceeds certain levels 
most of these arrangements allow us to minimize the potential liquidity impact of significant mark to market fluctuations by making collateral allocations from our bank credit facility or directly pledging oil and natural gas properties  rather than posting cash or letters of credit with the counterparties 
as of december   we had outstanding collateral allocations and pledges of oil and natural gas properties  with respect to commodity price risk management transactions but were not required to post any collateral with our counterparties through letters of credit issued under our bank credit facility 
as of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements february   we had outstanding transactions with fifteen counterparties  eight of which hold collateral allocations from our bank facility or liens against certain oil and natural gas properties under our secured hedging facilities  and two of which do not require us to provide security for our risk management transactions 
as of february   we were not required to post cash or letters of credit with the remaining five counterparties 
future collateral requirements are uncertain and will depend on the arrangements with our counterparties and highly volatile natural gas and oil prices 
a significant source of liquidity is our billion syndicated revolving bank credit facility which matures in february at february   there was billion of borrowing capacity available under the revolving bank credit facility 
we use the facility to fund daily operating activities and acquisitions as needed

we incurred million  million and million of financing costs related to our revolving bank credit facility in  and  respectively  as a result of amendments to the credit facility agreement

we believe that our available cash  cash provided by operating activities and funds available under our revolving bank credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operating  debt service and general and administrative expenses  our capital expenditure budget  our short term contractual obligations and dividend payments at current levels for the foreseeable future 
the public and institutional markets have been our principal source of long term financing for acquisitions 
we have sold debt and equity in both public and private offerings in the past  and we expect that these sources of capital will continue to be available to us in the future to finance acquisitions 
nevertheless  we caution that ready access to capital on reasonable terms and the availability of desirable acquisition targets at attractive prices are subject to many uncertainties  as explained under risk factors in item a

hedging activities oil and natural gas hedging activities our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and natural gas 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
executive management is involved in all risk management activities and the board of directors reviews the company s hedging program at every board meeting 
we believe we have sufficient internal controls to prevent unauthorized hedging 
as of december   our oil and natural gas derivative instruments were comprised of swaps  cap swaps  basis protection swaps  call options and collars 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk contains a description of each of these instruments 
although derivatives often fail to achieve effectiveness for accounting purposes  we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended 
hedging allows us to predict with greater certainty the effective prices we will receive for our hedged oil and natural gas production 
we closely monitor the fair value of our hedging contracts and may elect to settle a contract prior to its scheduled maturity date in order to lock in a gain or loss 
commodity markets are volatile and chesapeake s hedging activities are dynamic 
mark to market positions under oil and natural gas hedging contracts fluctuate with commodity prices 
as described above under contractual obligations  we may be required to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance if our payment obligations to our hedging counterparties exceed levels stated in our contracts

application of critical accounting policies readers of this report and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place 
the four policies we consider to be the most significant are discussed below 
the company s management has discussed each critical accounting policy with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that changes as our business changes and as accounting rules are developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
hedging 
chesapeake uses commodity price and financial risk management instruments to mitigate our exposure to price fluctuations in oil and natural gas  changes in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates 
recognized gains and losses on derivative contracts are reported as a component of the related transaction 
results of oil and natural gas derivative transactions are reflected in oil and natural gas sales  and results of interest rate and foreign exchange rate hedging transactions are reflected in interest expense 
the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying for designation as either cash flow or fair value hedges that occur prior to maturity are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains losses within oil and natural gas sales or interest expense 
cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the same category within the statement of cash flows as the items being hedged  or on a basis consistent with the nature of the instruments 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at the inception of a derivative 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness  as defined by sfas  is recognized immediately in oil and natural gas sales 
for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas  changes in fair value  as well as the offsetting changes in the estimated fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk  are recognized currently in earnings 
differences between the changes in the fair values of the hedged item and the derivative instrument  if any  represent gains or losses on ineffectiveness and are reflected currently in interest expense 
hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
changes in fair value of contracts that do not qualify as hedges or are not designated as hedges are also recognized currently in earnings 
see hedging activities above and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information regarding our hedging activities 
one of the primary factors that can have an impact on our results of operations is the method used to value our derivatives 
we have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties and subsequently confirmed the fair values internally using established index prices and other sources 
these values are based upon  among other things  futures prices  volatility  time to maturity and credit risk 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged  both at inception and on an ongoing basis 
this correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices  the primary risk we hedge  have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively 
the factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors  many of which are beyond our control 
due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and  to a lesser extent  interest rates and foreign exchange rates  the company s financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments 
as of december   and  the net market value of our derivatives was an asset of million  a liability of million and an asset of million  
table of contents 
index to financial statements respectively 
the derivatives that we acquired in our cnr acquisition represented million and million of liability at december  and with respect to our derivatives held as of december   an increase or decrease in natural gas prices of per mmbtu would decrease or increase the estimated fair value of our derivatives by approximately million 
an increase or decrease in crude oil prices of per barrel would decrease or increase the estimated fair value of our derivatives by approximately million 
oil and natural gas properties 
the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and natural gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and natural gas business activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
we also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of oil and natural gas properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the aggregated full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result  our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher oil and natural gas depreciation  depletion and amortization rate  and we will not have exploration expenses that successful efforts companies frequently have 
under the full cost method  capitalized costs are amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved oil and natural gas reserves 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense is also based on the amount of estimated reserves 
if we maintain the same level of production year over year  the depreciation  depletion and amortization expense may be significantly different if our estimate of remaining reserves changes significantly 
proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in the relationship between costs and the value of proved reserves or the underlying value of unproved properties  in which case a gain or loss is recognized 
the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated 
we review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties  and otherwise if impairment has occurred 
unevaluated properties are grouped by major producing area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant 
we review the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the securities and exchange commission on a quarterly basis 
this quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test 
under the ceiling test  capitalized costs  less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes  may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues adjusted for cash flow hedges less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves  less any related income tax effects 
in calculating future net revenues  current prices and costs used are those as of the end of the appropriate quarterly period 
such prices are utilized except where different prices are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts  including the effects of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges 
two primary factors impacting this test are reserve levels and current prices  and their associated impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues 
revisions to estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and or an increase or decrease in prices can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues 
any excess of the net book value  less deferred income taxes  is generally written off as an expense 
under sec regulations  the excess above the ceiling is not expensed or is reduced if  subsequent to the end of the period  but prior to the release of the financial statements  oil and natural gas prices increase sufficiently such that an excess above the ceiling would have been eliminated or reduced if the increased prices were used in the calculations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is very complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors  including additional development activity  evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates 
as of december   approximately of our proved reserves were evaluated by independent petroleum engineers  with the balance evaluated by our internal reservoir engineers 
in addition  our internal engineers review and update our reserves on a quarterly basis 
all reserve estimates are prepared based upon a review of production histories and other geologic  economic  ownership and engineering data we developed 
additional information about our year end reserve evaluation is included under oil and natural gas reserves in item business 
in addition  the prices of natural gas and oil are volatile and change from period to period 
price changes directly impact the estimated revenues from our properties and the associated present value of future net revenues 
such changes also impact the economic life of our properties and thereby affect the quantity of reserves that can be assigned to a property 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the federal and state income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which chesapeake operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as derivative instruments  depreciation  depletion and amortization  and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences and our net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess  using all available positive and negative evidence  the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
generally  to the extent chesapeake establishes a valuation allowance or increases or decreases this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provisions in the consolidated statement of operations 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
the more negative evidence that exists a the more positive evidence is necessary and b the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset 
among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are taxable income projections in future years  whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits  future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures  and our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition 
if a natural gas and oil prices were to decrease significantly below present levels and if such decreases were considered other than temporary  b exploration  drilling and operating costs were to increase significantly beyond current levels  or c we were confronted with any other significantly negative evidence pertaining to our ability to realize our nol carryforwards prior to their expiration  we may be required to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of million 

table of contents 
index to financial statements accounting for business combinations 
our business has grown substantially through acquisitions and our business strategy is to continue to pursue acquisitions as opportunities arise 
we have accounted for all of our business combinations using the purchase method  which is the only method permitted under sfas  accounting for business combinations 
the accounting for business combinations is complicated and involves the use of significant judgment 
under the purchase method of accounting  a business combination is accounted for at a purchase price based upon the fair value of the consideration given  whether in the form of cash  assets  stock or the assumption of liabilities 
the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair values  and the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon these fair values 
the excess of the cost of an acquired entity  if any  over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 
the excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquired entity  if any  is allocated as a pro rata reduction of the amounts that otherwise would have been assigned to certain acquired assets 
determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment  since some of the assets and liabilities acquired do not have fair values that are readily determinable 
different techniques may be used to determine fair values  including market prices  where available  appraisals  comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and present value of estimated future cash flows  among others 
since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment  they can change as new information becomes available 
we believe that the consideration we have paid for our oil and natural gas property acquisitions has represented the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the time of purchase 
consequently  we have not recognized any goodwill from any of our oil and natural gas property acquisitions  nor do we expect to recognize goodwill from similar business combinations that we may complete in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk oil and natural gas hedging activities our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and natural gas 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
as of december   our oil and natural gas derivative instruments were comprised of swaps  cap swaps  basis protection swaps  call options and collars 
these instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective oil and natural gas prices to be received for our hedged production 
although derivatives often fail to achieve effectiveness for accounting purposes  we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended 
for swap instruments  chesapeake receives a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pays a floating market price to the counterparty 
the fixed price payment and the floating price payment are netted  resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty 

table of contents 
index to financial statements for cap swaps  chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price 
the fixed price received by chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for a cap limiting the counterparty s exposure 
in other words  there is no limit to chesapeake s exposure but there is a limit to the downside exposure of the counterparty 
basis protection swaps are arrangements that guarantee a price differential for oil or natural gas from a specified delivery point 
for mid continent natural gas basis protection swaps  which have negative differentials to nymex  chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract 
for appalachian basin basis natural gas protection swaps  which have positive differentials to nymex  chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract 
for call options  chesapeake receives a cash premium from the counterparty in exchange for the sale of a call option 
if the market price exceeds the fixed price of the call option  chesapeake pays the counterparty such excess 
if the market price settles below the fixed price of the call option  no payment is due from chesapeake 
collars contain a fixed floor price put and ceiling price call 
if the market price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price  chesapeake receives the fixed price and pays the market price 
if the market price is between the call and the put strike price  no payments are due from either party 
chesapeake enters into counter swaps from time to time for the purpose of locking in the value of a swap 
under the counter swap  chesapeake receives a floating price for the hedged commodity and pays a fixed price to the counterparty 
the counter swap is effective in locking in the value of a swap since subsequent changes in the market value of the swap are entirely offset by subsequent changes in the market value of the counter swap 
we refer to this locked in value as a locked swap 
generally  at the time chesapeake enters into a counter swap  chesapeake removes the original swap s designation as a cash flow hedge and classifies the original swap as a non qualifying hedge under sfas the reason for this new designation is that collectively the swap and the counter swap no longer hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows 
instead  the swap and counter swap effectively lock in a specific gain or loss that will be unaffected by subsequent variability in oil and natural gas prices 
any locked in gain or loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to oil and natural gas sales in the month of related production 
with respect to counter swaps that are designed to lock in the value of cap swaps  the counter swap is effective in locking in the value of the cap swap until the floating price reaches the cap or floor stipulated in the cap swap agreement 
the value of the counter swap will increase or decrease  but in the opposite direction  as the value of the cap swap decreases or increases until the floating price reaches the pre determined cap or floor stipulated in the cap swap agreement 
however  because of the written put option embedded in the cap swap  the changes in value of the cap swap are not completely effective in offsetting changes in value of the corresponding counter swap 
changes in the value of cap swaps and counter swaps are recorded as adjustments to oil and natural gas sales 
in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 to the extent that a legal right of setoff exists  chesapeake nets the value of its derivative arrangements with the same counterparty in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets

the recognition of the derivative liability and other assumed liabilities resulted in an increase in the total purchase price which was allocated to the assets acquired 
because of this accounting treatment  only cash settlements for changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition date for the derivative positions assumed result in adjustments to our oil and natural gas revenues upon settlement 
for example  if the fair value of the derivative positions assumed do not change  then upon the sale of the underlying production and corresponding settlement of the derivative positions  cash would be paid to the counterparties and there would be no adjustment to oil and natural gas revenues related to the derivative positions 
if  however  the actual sales price is different from the price assumed in the original fair value calculation  the difference would be reflected as either a decrease or increase in oil and natural gas revenues  depending upon whether the sales price was higher or lower  respectively  than the prices assumed in the original fair value calculation 
for accounting purposes  the net effect of these acquired hedges is that we hedged the production volumes at market prices on the date of our acquisition of cnr
