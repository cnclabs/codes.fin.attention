item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business trends our corporate structure includes separate pay per transaction ppt and advanced media and information ami operating divisions and  accordingly  we report certain financial information by individual segment under this structure 
our ppt division focuses on managing our business operations that facilitate the delivery of home entertainment content products dvds  vhs tapes  etc 
and related rental and sales information for the content to home video specialty stores and other retailers  on a revenue sharing basis 
we lease product from various suppliers  typically motion picture studios 
under our ppt system  retailers sublease that product from us and rent it to consumers 
retailers then share a portion of each retail rental transaction with us and we share a portion of revenue with the studio 
since we collect  process and analyze rental and sales information at the title level  we report that information to both the studio and the respective retailers 
our ami division concentrates on the management and growth of our essentials suite of business intelligence services  as well as operating our direct revenue sharing drs services 
our essentials suite software and services  offered on a recurring subscription basis  provide unique data collection  management  analysis and reporting functions  resulting in business intelligence information valuable to our clients 
our drs services collect  track  audit and report the results to the respective suppliers under established agreements on a fee for service basis 
during the first quarter of fiscal  supply chain essentials  ondemand essentials and retail essentials moved from the other division to the ami division as these lines were considered to be no longer in the development stage 
the ppt division the financial results from the ppt division continue to be affected by the changing dynamics in the home video rental market 
this market is highly competitive and influenced greatly by consumer spending patterns and behaviors 
the end consumer has a wide variety of choices from which to select their entertainment content 
some examples include renting units of product from our participating retailers  purchasing previously viewed units from our participating retailers  ordering product via online subscriptions and or online distributors  subscribing to at home movie channels  purchasing and owning the unit directly or selecting an at home pay per view or on demand option 
our ppt system focuses on the traditional brick and mortar retailer 
we believe that our system successfully addresses the many choices available to consumers and affords our participating retailers the opportunity to stock their stores with a wider selection of titles and a greater supply of popular box office releases 
most of our arrangements are structured so that most participating retailers pay minimal upfront fees and lower per transaction fees in exchange for ordering units of all titles offered by a particular program supplier referred to as output programs 
since these programs usually result in more overall units rented  our retailers revenue and the corresponding share with the studios have increased 
these programs are  in part  an economic response to the changing dynamics of the home video rental market 
we expect the growth of these output programs to continue  and believe that they will be financially beneficial for the participating retailers  program suppliers and us 
our base of participating retailers continues to be strong and we are implementing strategies to obtain new participating retailers and program suppliers in an effort to further stabilize and grow our overall ppt revenue and earnings streams 
currently  we are continuing negotiations with our third largest program supplier 
to date  however  we have been unable to finalize a new agreement with this supplier 
we continue to be in good standing with our remaining program suppliers and we make on going efforts to enhance those business relationships through improvement of current services offered and the development of new service offerings 
we are also continually seeking to develop business relationships with new program suppliers 
in november  based on our successful involvement with a major studio in canada  we entered into a revenue sharing agreement which extends product offerings to participating retailers in the united states 
this agreement was effective for titles released beginning in january  giving our us participating retailers access to the large volume of high quality entertainment that this major studio has been delivering for years  and yielding of our total revenues in fiscal also  in october  we began offering product from a major studio to our us participating retailers yielding of our total revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal additional program suppliers represented  and of our total revenues in fiscal as is typical of our agreements with program suppliers  our relationships with these program suppliers may be terminated without cause upon thirty days written notice by either party 
ami and other divisions we are also allocating significant resources towards our business intelligence service offerings  both those services that are currently operational as well as those that are in various stages of development 
our suite of business intelligence services has been well received in the various targeted markets to date  as our offerings fit well with the needs identified by those market participants 
our essentials business intelligence service offerings which are fully operational and no longer in significant stages of development  realized a revenue increase of during fiscal compared to fiscal we intend to continue to invest in our existing  as well as new  business intelligence services in the near term as we expand the markets we serve and our service lines  which likely will lower our earnings 
longer term  we believe these services will provide significant future revenue and earnings streams and contribute to our overall success 
sources of revenue revenue by segment includes the following ppt division order processing fees generated when units are ordered by and distributed to retailers  transaction fees generated when retailers rent units to consumers  additionally  certain arrangements include guaranteed minimum revenues from our customers  we recognize the guaranteed minimum revenue on the street release date in accordance with statement of position  accounting by producers or distributors of films  sop provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met  sell through fees generated when retailers sell previously viewed rental units to consumers  and buy out fees generated when retailers purchase units at the end of the lease term 
ami division direct revenue sharing fees from data tracking and reporting services provided to program suppliers drs  revenues from box office essentials  revenues from home video essentials  revenues from supply chain essentials  revenues from ondemand essentials  and revenues from retail essentials 
other division revenue relating to other products and or services which are still in the development stage  including adtraker  which will capture census level data regarding viewing patterns of on demand advertising for reporting to marketers and advertising agencies

revenue revenue increased million  or to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal we realized increases in revenue across all of our major product lines in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to decreases in transaction fees and sell through fees  partially offset by increases in order processing fees and our essentials suite of business intelligence services as described more fully below 
ppt division ppt revenues increased million  or in fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased million  or in fiscal compared to fiscal detail of our ppt division revenue by service line was as follows in thousands year ended march  order processing fees transaction fees sell through fees other order processing fees increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal due partially to two new output programs with major suppliers  which went into effect in january and march  as well as increased volumes and quality of content from some of our existing program suppliers 
these stronger product offerings resulted in higher order processing fees per unit in fiscal compared to fiscal these fees increased to per unit in fiscal compared to per unit in fiscal  resulting in an increase of million in revenues 
in addition  the number of units shipped with release dates in each period increased by to million units in fiscal compared to million units in fiscal  which contributed to a million increase in revenue 
order processing fees increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a new output program with a major supplier  which was effective april  and another new output program that was effective in september the terms of these new agreements  and their utilization by our participating retailers during fiscal  resulted in higher order processing fees per unit compared with fiscal these fees increased to per unit in fiscal  compared to per unit in fiscal  resulting in an increase of million 
partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in units shipped to million units during fiscal compared to million units in fiscal  which contributed to an approximate million decrease in revenue based on fiscal per unit fees 
in fiscal  we shipped million units to a major participating retailer whose contract expired in september excluding the impact of this contract  overall units shipped to other participating retailers increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the addition of the new output programs mentioned above 
transaction fees increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to increased transactions related to output programs that began during the last quarter of fiscal as discussed above 
rental transactions at our participating retailers increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  while the rate per transaction remained relatively flat 
a portion of the rental transactions were from arrangements which included minimum guarantees 
for fiscal  our rental transaction volume increase of was reduced by rental guarantee transaction fees previously recognized in fiscal  which resulted in a net increase in transactions fees of transaction fees decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in transaction fees in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the loss of a significant participating retailer whose contract expired in september  partially offset by increased fees related to the new output programs discussed above 
fees from this significant participating retailer were million in fiscal excluding the impact of this participating retailer  transaction fees from all other participating retailers increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal sell through fees increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to higher volumes of product available for sale to our participating retailers 
sell through fees decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal we realized an approximate million decrease in sell through fees due to the loss of the significant participating retailer mentioned above 
this decrease was partially offset by a million  or increase  due to an increase in the number of units shipped to other participating retailers 
ami division revenues from our ami division increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased million  or in fiscal compared to fiscal our essentials business intelligence service offerings  which include those services that management considers fully operational and no longer in significant stages of development  saw revenue increases of million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal and of million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal revenues related to our essentials business intelligence service offerings have increased primarily due to our continued investment in  and marketing of  these offerings 
drs revenues increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal due to increases in the number of transactions processed by us and the addition of new customers 
drs revenues decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a decrease in the total number of drs rental transactions processed 
this decrease resulted from a decline in the number of drs rental transactions processed for one of our major studios in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a change in the relationship between the studio and one of its direct revenue sharing customers 
other division we did not have any revenues from our other division in fiscal as supply chain essentials  ondemand essentials and retail essentials moved from the other division to the ami division during the first quarter of fiscal accordingly  revenue related to these products in fiscal and fiscal was reclassified to the ami division for comparison purposes 
a new revenue stream  adtraker  is still in development and has not generated any revenue to date 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of order processing costs  transaction costs  sell through costs  handling and freight costs in the ppt division and costs in the ami division associated with certain essentials business intelligence service offerings 
these expenditures represent the direct costs to produce revenues 
in the ppt division  order processing costs  transaction costs and sell through costs represent the amounts due to the program suppliers that hold the distribution rights to the units 
freight costs represent the cost to pick  pack and ship orders of units to the participating retailers 
our cost of sales can also be impacted by the release dates of units with guarantees 
we recognize the guaranteed minimum costs on the release date 
the terms of some of our agreements result in cost of sales on titles in the first month in which the unit is released  which results in lower margins during the initial portion of the revenue sharing period 
once the unit s rental activity exceeds the required amount for these guaranteed minimums  margins generally expand during the second and third months of the unit s revenue sharing period 
however  since these factors are highly dependent upon the quality  timing and release dates of all new products  margins may not expand to any significant degree during any period 
as such  it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact programs with guaranteed minimums will have on future results of operations in any reporting period 
in the ami division  a portion of the essentials business intelligence service offerings costs represent costs associated with the operation of a call center for our box office essentials services  as well as costs associated with amortizing capitalized internally developed software used to provide the corresponding services and direct costs incurred to obtain  cleanse and process data and maintain our systems 
cost of sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in cost of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the increase in revenues discussed above 
the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher ppt revenue discussed above and an increase in ami revenue as a percentage of total revenue 
revenue from our ami division generates higher gross margins than revenue from our ppt division 
the decrease in cost of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in revenues discussed above 
the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to improved margins for the ppt segment  offset by lower margins in the ami segment 
the ppt segment experienced lower cost of sales as a percentage of revenue primarily as a result of the higher order processing fees related to the new output programs mentioned above 
the higher order processing fees per unit from most of these new output programs generate minimal corresponding costs  which resulted in improved margins 
the higher costs for the ami segment primarily related to reduced drs revenue as well as increased costs associated with the operation of our call center 
selling and administrative selling and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits  development  marketing and advertising costs  legal and professional fees  communications costs  depreciation and amortization of tangible fixed assets and software  real and personal property leases  as well as other general corporate expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and increased million  or  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in selling and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to increases in compensation and related expenses due to expansion of our existing and new lines of business 
in addition  fiscal included  of stock based compensation expense related to stock options and deferred stock units in connection with the implementation of sfas no 
r compared to zero in fiscal see also note of notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
as a percentage of revenues  selling and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal  primarily due to increased revenues over which fixed costs are spread  partially offset by the increases noted above 
the increase in selling and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in expenditures related to our continued investment in the development and marketing of our essentials business service offerings and a million increase in our bonus accrual 
additionally  selling and administrative expenses in fiscal included a non cash charge of million related to the fair value of stock options granted to a consultant 
these increases were offset in part by lower fees for sarbanes oxley related consulting services in fiscal compared to fiscal additionally  in fiscal  we recovered million related to an embezzlement  which was discovered in march net loss on litigation settlement the net loss on litigation settlement of million in fiscal relates to the settlement of a disagreement with a fulfillment provider which arose in connection with the sale of our pf 
com assets 
the million includes million in damages and related interest for full settlement of all the claims and the complete mutual release from any further obligations of either party and million of legal fees 
asset impairment asset impairment of  in fiscal relates to the write off of capitalized software development costs for two projects which management determined would not be completed or placed in service 
interest income interest income was million  million and million  respectively  in fiscal  and the increases in interest income primarily related to higher interest rates and higher average cash and investment balances in fiscal compared to fiscal and in fiscal compared to fiscal the higher interest rates were due to both higher market rates and the investment of our cash in higher yield investments 
our average combined cash and investment balance was million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
income taxes our effective tax rate was  and  respectively  in fiscal  and our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to state income taxes 
the effective tax rate in fiscal benefited from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards  most of which were fully utilized by march   and which previously had been reserved against 
inflation we believe that the impact of inflation was minimal on our business in fiscal  and liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity include our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  cash expected to be generated from future operations and investment income and our million line of credit 
based on our current financial projections and projected cash needs  we believe that our available sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our current operations  the continued current development of our business intelligence services and other cash requirements through at least march  cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at march  compared to million at march  this decrease resulted primarily from the use of million for the purchase of marketable securities  million for the purchase of property and equipment and million for the repurchase of our common stock  partially offset by million provided by operations and million provided by notes payable 
our current ratio was at march  and at march  accounts receivable  net of allowances  increased million to million at march  compared to million at march   due primarily to higher revenues on our essentials lines of business which led to higher balances on accounts from our essentials customers  as well as the timing of billings to customers of the ppt division 
during fiscal  we spent million on property and equipment  including million for the capitalization of internally developed software for our business intelligence service offerings 
the remaining expenditures were primarily for new accounting software and costs associated with our corporate headquarter office renovations 
as further discussed below  we have received reimbursements totaling million from our landlord  the state of oregon and the portland development commission to offset these expenditures 
see also note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we anticipate spending a total of approximately million on property and equipment in fiscal  including approximately million for the capitalization of internally developed software  primarily for our business intelligence service offerings 
other capital expenditures in fiscal will be primarily for computer equipment 
accounts payable decreased million to million at march  compared to million at march  primarily due to the timing of program supplier and other vendor payments 
deferred rent  current and long term  of million at march  represents amounts received for qualified renovations on our corporate headquarters and free rent for the first three months of the lease term 
the deferred rent is being amortized against rent expense over the term of the related lease and totals approximately  per quarter 
see also note of notes to consolidated financial statements and critical accounting policies and estimates landlord incentives below 
notes payable of million at march  represents a loan from the portland development commission pdc  a  conditional grant from the pdc and a loan from the state of oregon related to our corporate headquarters renovations 
the loan from the pdc of million does not bear interest until it becomes due  which is january   and contains provisions relating to forgiveness if we meet certain requirements 
if the loan is not forgiven  it will accrue interest at the rate of per annum beginning on the date that it becomes due 
however  if the loan is forgiven  no interest will accrue 
similar terms apply to the conditional grant of  the loan from the state of oregon of million bears interest at the rate of per annum and contains provisions relating to forgiveness if we meet certain requirements

in january  our board of directors adopted a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to  shares of our common stock 
through march    shares had been repurchased under this plan at an average price of per share and  shares remained available for purchase 
this plan does not have an expiration date 
we currently have a secured revolving line of credit for million  with a maturity of december  interest on the line of credit is at our choice of either the bank s prime interest rate minus percent or libor plus percent 
the credit line is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the line of credit includes certain financial covenants requiring a consolidated pre tax income to be achieved each fiscal quarter of a minimum of  and consolidated after tax income not less than on an annual basis  determined at fiscal year end  a minimum current ratio of  measured quarterly  and a maximum debt to tangible net worth ratio of  measured quarterly 
based upon the financial results reported as of  and for the quarter ended march   we determined that we were in compliance with the financial covenants at march  at march   we had no outstanding borrowings under this agreement 
contractual payment obligations a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of march  was as follows in thousands payments due by fiscal period contractual obligation total and and and beyond operating leases pdc loan and conditional grant state of oregon loan program supplier guarantees management contracts the loan from the pdc of million does not bear interest until it becomes due and contains provisions relating to forgiveness if we meet certain requirements

see also our definitive proxy statement for our annual meeting for details of our executive compensation 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  significant accounting policies  for additional information 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable by monitoring past due balances 
if it is determined that a customer may be unable to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is established based on the amount we expect to recover 
an additional general reserve is provided based on aging of accounts receivable and our historical collection experience 
if circumstances change related to specific customers  overall aging of accounts receivable or collection experience  our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could materially change 
our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled  and  respectively  at march  and program supplier reserves we have entered into guarantee contracts with certain program suppliers providing titles for distribution under our ppt system 
these contracts guarantee the program suppliers minimum payments per unit shipped that are recoupable based on revenue sharing activity 
in some cases  these guarantees are paid in advance 
for amounts not paid in advance  we record a liability for the gross amount of the guarantee due to the program supplier on the street date in accordance with statement of position  accounting by producers or distributors of films sop 
for guarantees paid in advance  the unearned portion of the guarantees is included as advances to program suppliers on our consolidated balance sheets 
using historical experience and year to date rental experience for each title  we estimate the projected revenue to be generated under each guarantee 
we have historically been able to reasonably estimate shortages after to days of rental activity 
we then establish a program supplier reserve for titles that are projected to experience a shortage under the provisions of the guarantee 
the program supplier reserve is netted against advances to program suppliers on our consolidated balance sheets 
we continually review these factors and make adjustments to the reserves as needed 
the balance in this reserve totaled million and million  respectively  at march  and deferred taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 deferred tax assets arise from the tax benefit of amounts expensed for financial reporting purposes but not yet deducted for tax purposes and from unutilized tax credits and nol carry forwards 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
to the extent it is determined the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is unlikely  we will record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
as of march  and  we had a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  recorded against our canadian net operating loss carryforwards 
net deferred tax assets liabilities totaled million and million  respectively  as of march  and landlord incentives we maintain our headquarters in portland  oregon 
on december   we renewed our current lease 
the new lease term began on january  and expires on december  during fiscal  we renovated our headquarter offices and expanded our occupancy from  square feet to approximately  square feet 
our new lease contains provisions relating to an allowance from our landlord associated with the costs of our improvements  as well as three months of free rent 
these landlord incentives totaled million at march   are recorded as deferred rent and are being amortized at the rate of approximately  per quarter  as a reduction to lease expense over the lease term 
the leasehold improvements are recorded as assets and are included in property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet 
the leasehold improvements are being depreciated over their economic lives  which are estimated to be years 
stock based compensation on april   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted to our employees and directors  including employee stock options and deferred stock units dsus based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
r  we maintained our method of valuation for stock option awards using the black scholes valuation model  which we had used historically for the purpose of providing pro forma financial disclosures in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
as of march   unrecognized stock based compensation related to outstanding  but unvested  options and dsus was million  which will be recognized over the weighted average remaining vesting period of years 
the use of the black scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards requires us to make judgments on assumptions regarding the risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected term and expected volatility over the expected term of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of expense could be materially different in the future 
compensation expense is only recognized on awards that ultimately vest 
however  we have not reduced the stock based compensation expense for estimated forfeitures as there is no basis for estimating future forfeitures as most unvested options are held by members of senior management and the board of directors 
we update for forfeitures as they occur and recognize any changes to accumulated compensation expense in the period of change 
if actual forfeitures are significant  our results of operations could be materially impacted 
new accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements 
off balance sheet arrangements other than disclosed above under contractual payment obligations  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have considered the provisions of financial reporting release no 
disclosure of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments  and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
we had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at march  a review of our other financial instruments and risk exposures at march  revealed that we had exposure to interest rate risk related to our cash deposits and marketable securities 
we utilized sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of this risk and concluded that near term changes in interest rates should not materially adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
