item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading independent auto finance company specializing in purchasing retail automobile installment sales contracts originated by franchised and select independent dealers in connection with the sale of used and new automobiles and  to a lesser extent  making loans directly to consumers buying new and used vehicles as well as providing lease financing through our dealership network 
we generate revenue and cash flows primarily through the purchase  retention  subsequent securitization and servicing of finance receivables 
as used herein  loans include auto finance receivables originated by dealers and purchased by us as well as direct extensions of credit made by us to consumer borrowers 
to fund the acquisition of receivables prior to securitization and to fund the repurchase of receivables pursuant to clean up call options  we use available cash and borrowings under our credit facilities 
we earn finance charge income on the finance receivables and pay interest expense on borrowings under our credit facilities 
we  through wholly owned subsidiaries  periodically transfer receivables to securitization trusts trusts that issue asset backed securities to investors 
we retain an interest in these securitization transactions in the form of restricted cash accounts and overcollateralization  whereby more receivables are transferred to the trusts than the amount of asset backed securities issued by the trusts  as well as the estimated future excess cash flows expected to be received over the life of the securitization 
excess cash flows result from the difference between the finance charges received from the obligors on the receivables and the interest paid to investors in the asset backed securities  net of credit losses and expenses 
excess cash flows from the trusts are initially utilized to fund credit enhancement requirements in order to attain specific credit ratings for the asset backed securities issued by the trusts 
once predetermined credit enhancement requirements are reached and maintained  excess cash flows are distributed to us 
credit enhancement requirements will increase if targeted portfolio performance ratios are exceeded 
in addition to excess cash flows  we receive monthly base servicing fees and we collect other fees  such as late charges  as servicer for securitization trusts 
we structure our securitization transactions as secured financings 
accordingly  following a securitization  the finance receivables and the related securitization notes payable remain on the consolidated balance sheets 
we recognize finance charge and fee income on the receivables and interest expense on the securities issued in the securitization transaction and record a provision for loan losses to cover probable loan losses on the receivables 

table of contents prior to october   securitization transactions were structured as sales of finance receivables 
we also acquired two securitization trusts which were accounted for as sales of finance receivables 
receivables sold under this structure are referred to herein as gain on sale receivables 
at june   we had one outstanding gain on sale securitization that represents less than one percent of our managed receivables 
on may   we acquired the stock of bvac 
bvac serves auto dealers in states offering specialized auto finance products  including extended term financing and higher loan to value advances to consumers with prime credit scores 
on january   we acquired the stock of lbac 
lbac operates from regional offices in paramus  new jersey and orange  california and serves auto dealers in states offering auto finance products primarily to consumers with near prime credit bureau scores 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of revenue and costs and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates and those differences may be material 
the accounting estimates that we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established systematically based on the determination of the amount of probable credit losses inherent in the finance receivables as of the reporting date 
we review charge off experience factors  delinquency reports  historical collection rates  estimates of the value of the underlying collateral  economic trends  such as unemployment rates  and other information in order to make the necessary judgments as to the probable credit losses 
we also use historical charge off experience to determine a loss confirmation period  which is defined as the time between when an event  such as delinquency status  giving rise to a probable credit loss occurs with respect to a specific account and when such account is charged off 
this loss confirmation period is applied to the forecasted probable credit losses to determine the amount of losses inherent in finance receivables at the reporting date 
assumptions regarding credit losses and loss confirmation periods are reviewed periodically and may be impacted by actual 
table of contents performance of finance receivables and changes in any of the factors discussed above 
should the credit loss assumption or loss confirmation period increase  there would be an increase in the amount of allowance for loan losses required  which would decrease the net carrying value of finance receivables and increase the amount of provision for loan losses recorded on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
a and increase in cumulative net credit losses over the loss confirmation period would increase the allowance for loan losses as of june   as follows in thousands adverse change adverse change impact on allowance for loan losses we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable losses inherent in our receivables  however  because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge off amount will not exceed such estimates or that our credit loss assumptions will not increase 
stock based compensation the fair value of each option granted or modified during fiscal  and was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions year ended june  expected dividends expected volatility risk free interest rate expected life years years years we have not paid out dividends historically  thus the dividend yields are estimated at zero percent 
expected volatility reflects an average of the implied and historical volatility rates 
management believes that a combination of market based measures is currently the best available indicator of expected volatility 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield available for zero coupon us government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options 
the expected lives of options are determined based on our historical option exercise experience and the term of the option 

table of contents assumptions are reviewed each time there is a new grant or modification of a previous grant and may be impacted by actual fluctuation in our stock price  movements in market interest rates and option terms 
the use of different assumptions produces a different fair value for the options granted or modified and impacts the amount of compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
the impact of a or increase in our assumptions of volatility  risk free interest rate and expected life on the amount of compensation expense recognized would not have been material for fiscal  and income taxes we are subject to income tax in the united states and canada 
in the ordinary course of our business  there may be transactions  calculations  structures and filing positions where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
at any point in time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions and we record probable liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes  penalties  and interest may be due 
management believes that the estimates are reasonable 
however  due to expiring statutes of limitations  audits  settlements  changes in tax law or new authoritative rulings  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will be comparable to what was reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
if actual results differ from estimated results or if we adjust these assumptions in the future  we may need to adjust our deferred tax assets or liabilities which could materially impact the effective tax rate  earnings  deferred tax balances and cash 
as a part of our financial reporting process  we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered 
if recovery is not likely  the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated to be unrecoverable 
in this process  certain criteria are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets  taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses  credit carrybacks  and estimated taxable income in future years 
based upon our earnings history and earnings projections  management believes it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of the asset will be fully realized 
accordingly  no valuation allowance has been provided on deferred taxes 
our judgment regarding future taxable income may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require adjustments to these deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period in which such determinations are made

delinquencies in our receivables portfolio may vary from period to period based upon the average age or seasoning of the portfolio  seasonality within the calendar year and economic factors 
due to our target customer base  a relatively high percentage of accounts become delinquent at some point in the life of a loan and there is a high rate of account movement between current and delinquent status in the portfolio 
delinquencies in finance receivables were lower at june   as compared to june   as a result of the inclusion of the bvac and lbac portfolios 
deferrals in accordance with our policies and guidelines  we  at times  offer payment deferrals to consumers  whereby the consumer is allowed to move up to two delinquent payments to the end of the loan generally by paying a fee approximately the interest portion of the payment deferred  except where state law provides for a lesser amount 
our policies and guidelines limit the number and frequency of deferments that may be granted 
additionally  we generally limit the granting of deferments on new accounts until a requisite number of payments have been received 
due to the nature of our customer base and policies and guidelines of the deferral program  approximately of accounts historically comprising the managed portfolio received a deferral at some point in the life of the account  however  we anticipate that the level of deferments will decline as higher quality loans are added to the portfolio  such as those originated through our lbac and bvac platforms  and comprise a greater percentage of the total 

table of contents an account for which all delinquent payments are deferred is classified as current at the time the deferment is granted and therefore is not included as a delinquent account

the increase in contracts receiving a payment deferral as a percentage of average finance receivables in fiscal and fiscal as compared to fiscal is a result of seasoning of the portfolio

table of contents june  finance receivables gain on sale total managed never deferred deferred times times greater than times total deferred total we evaluate the results of our deferment strategies based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred versus the extent to which the collateral underlying the deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time 
based on this evaluation  we believe that payment deferrals granted according to our policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections from the portfolio 
changes in deferment levels do not have a direct impact on the ultimate amount of finance receivables charged off by us 
however  the timing of a charge off may be affected if the previously deferred account ultimately results in a charge off 
to the extent that deferrals impact the ultimate timing of when an account is charged off  historical charge off ratios and loss confirmation periods used in the determination of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses are also impacted 
increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period  which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and therefore increase the allowance for loan losses and related provision for loan losses 
changes in these ratios and periods are considered in determining the appropriate level of allowance for loan losses and related provision for loan losses

table of contents we structure our securitization transactions as secured financings 
finance receivables are transferred to a securitization trust  which is one of our special purpose finance subsidiaries  and the trusts issue one or more series of asset backed securities securitization notes payable 
while these trusts are included in our consolidated financial statements  these trusts are separate legal entities  thus the finance receivables and other assets held by these trusts are legally owned by these trusts  are available to satisfy the related securitization notes payable and are not available to our creditors or our other subsidiaries 
at the time of securitization of finance receivables  we are required to pledge assets equal to a specified percentage of the securitization pool to provide credit enhancement required for specific credit ratings for the asset backed securities issued by the trusts 
generally  we employ two types of securitization structures 
the structure we have utilized most frequently involves the purchase of a financial guaranty insurance policy issued by an insurer 
our most recent transaction completed in july excluded any receivables originated under the bvac and lbac platforms and had an initial cash deposit and overcollateralization level of and target credit enhancement of 
under this structure  we typically expect to begin to receive cash distributions approximately seven to nine months after receivables are securitized 
we completed a transaction using a financial guaranty insurance policy including only receivables originated under the lbac platform in march that had an initial credit enhancement level of and target credit enhancement of 
we expect to begin to receive cash distributions for this transaction approximately eight to ten months after receivables are securitized 
the second type of securitization structure we use involves the sale of subordinated asset backed securities in order to provide credit enhancement for the senior asset backed securities 
our most recent securitization transaction for primarily sub prime receivables involving the sale of subordinated asset backed securities was completed in march and required an initial cash deposit and overcollateralization level of of the original receivable pool balance  and a target credit enhancement level of of the receivable pool balance must be reached before excess cash is used to repay the class e bonds 
subsequent to the payoff of class e bonds  excess cash is distributed to us 
under this structure  we typically expect to begin to receive cash distributions approximately to months after receivables are securitized 
in may  we executed our first transaction under our securitization program for near prime and prime receivables 
this securitization transaction involved the sale of subordinated asset backed securities 
additionally  this transaction required an initial cash deposit and overcollateralization level of of the original receivable pool balance  and a target credit enhancement level of of the receivable pool balance must be reached before excess cash is used to paydown the principal balance of the class e bonds 
table of contents to maintain a specified amount outstanding 
excess cash not utilized to paydown the class e bonds will be released to us 
under this structure  we typically expect to begin to receive cash distributions approximately ten to twelve months after receivables are securitized 
increases or decreases to the credit enhancement level required in future securitization transactions will depend on the net interest margin of the finance receivables transferred  the collateral characteristics of the receivables transferred  credit performance trends of our finance receivables  our financial condition and the economic environment 
cash flows related to securitization transactions were as follows in millions years ended june  initial credit enhancement deposits restricted cash overcollateralization distributions from trusts gain on sale trusts secured financing trusts the agreements with the insurers of our securitization transactions covered by a financial guaranty insurance policy provide that if portfolio performance ratios delinquency  cumulative default or cumulative net loss in a trust s pool of receivables exceed certain targets  the specified credit enhancement levels would be increased 
generally  our securitization transactions insured by financial guaranty insurance providers and entered into prior to september are cross collateralized to a limited extent 
in the event of a shortfall in the original target credit enhancement requirement for any of these securitization trusts after a certain period of time  excess cash flows from other transactions insured by the same insurance provider would be used to satisfy the shortfall amount 
our securitization transactions insured by financial guaranty insurance policies after august do not contain any cross collateralization provisions 
the agreements that we enter into with our financial guaranty insurance providers in connection with securitization transactions contain additional specified targeted portfolio performance ratios delinquency  cumulative default and cumulative net loss that are higher than the limits referred to above 
if  at any measurement date  the targeted portfolio performance ratios with respect to any 
table of contents insured trust were to exceed these additional levels  provisions of the agreements permit the financial guaranty insurance providers to terminate our servicing rights to the receivables sold to that trust 
in addition  the servicing agreements on certain insured securitization trusts are cross defaulted so that a default under one servicing agreement would allow the financial guaranty insurance provider to terminate our servicing rights under all servicing agreements for securitization trusts in which they issued a financial guaranty insurance policy 
additionally  if these higher targeted portfolio performance levels were exceeded  the financial guaranty insurance providers may elect to retain all excess cash generated by other securitization transactions insured by them as additional credit enhancement 
this  in turn  could result in defaults under our other securitizations and other material indebtedness 
although we have never exceeded these additional targeted portfolio performance ratios  and do not anticipate violating any event of default triggers for our securitizations  there can be no assurance that our servicing rights with respect to the automobile receivables in such trusts or any other trusts will not be terminated if i such targeted portfolio performance ratios are breached  ii we breach our obligations under the servicing agreements  iii the financial guaranty insurance providers are required to make payments under a policy  or iv certain bankruptcy or insolvency events were to occur 
as of june   no such termination events have occurred with respect to any of the trusts formed by us 
stock repurchases during fiscal  and  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share   shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share and  shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share  respectively 
subsequent to june   we repurchased an additional  shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share 
as of august   we had repurchased  million of our common stock since april and we had remaining authorization to repurchase million of our common stock 
a covenant in our senior note indenture entered into in january limits our ability to repurchase stock 
as of august   we have approximately million available for share repurchases under the indenture limits 
operating plan we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to achieve our growth strategies 
as of june   we had unrestricted cash balances of million 
assuming that origination volume ranges from billion to billion during fiscal and the initial credit enhancement requirement for our securitization transactions remains the same as recent transactions  we expect that cash distributions 
table of contents from our securitization transactions combined with cash generated from unsecuritized receivables will exceed the funding requirement for initial credit enhancement deposits during fiscal we will continue to require the execution of additional securitization transactions during fiscal there can be no assurance that funding will be available to us through the execution of securitization transactions or  if available  that the funding will be on acceptable terms 
if we are unable to execute securitization transactions on a regular basis  and are otherwise unable to issue any other debt or equity  we would not have sufficient funds to finance new loan originations and  in such event  we would be required to revise the scale of our business  including possible discontinuation of loan origination activities  which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business and financial objectives 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently have one securitization transaction structured to meet the accounting criteria for a sale of finance receivables 
under this structure  notes issued by our unconsolidated qualified special purpose finance subsidiaries are not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
see liquidity and capital resources securitizations for a detailed discussion of our securitization transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk fluctuations in market interest rates impact our credit facilities and securitization transactions 
our gross interest rate spread  which is the difference between interest earned on our finance receivables and interest paid  is affected by changes in interest rates as a result of our dependence upon the issuance of variable rate securities and the incurrence of variable rate debt to fund our purchases of finance receivables 
credit facilities finance receivables purchased by us and pledged to secure borrowings under our credit facilities bear fixed interest rates 
amounts borrowed under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates that are subject to frequent adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates 
to protect the interest rate spread within each credit facility  our special purpose finance subsidiaries are contractually required to purchase interest rate cap agreements in connection with borrowings under our credit facilities 
the purchaser of the interest rate cap agreement pays a premium in return for the right to receive the difference in the interest cost at any time a specified index of market interest rates rises above the stipulated cap rate 
the purchaser of the interest rate cap agreement bears no obligation or liability if interest rates fall below the cap rate 
as part of our interest rate risk management strategy and when 
table of contents economically feasible  we may simultaneously sell a corresponding interest rate cap agreement in order to offset the premium paid by our special purpose finance subsidiary to purchase the interest rate cap agreement and thus retain the interest rate risk 
the fair value of the interest rate cap agreement purchased by the special purpose finance subsidiary is included in other assets and the fair value of the interest rate cap agreement sold by us is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
in november  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in interest payments on our medium term notes facility caused by fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate 
these interest rate swap agreements are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
securitizations the interest rate demanded by investors in our securitization transactions depends on prevailing market interest rates for comparable transactions and the general interest rate environment 
we utilize several strategies to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our gross interest rate margin  including the use of derivative financial instruments  the regular sale or pledging of auto receivables to securitization trusts  pre funding of securitization transactions and the use of revolving structures 
in our securitization transactions  we transfer fixed rate finance receivables to trusts that  in turn  sell either fixed rate or floating rate securities to investors 
the fixed rates on securities issued by the trusts are indexed to market interest rate swap spreads for transactions of similar duration or various london interbank offered rates libor and do not fluctuate during the term of the securitization 
the floating rates on securities issued by the trusts are indexed to libor and fluctuate periodically based on movements in libor 
derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swap and cap agreements  are used to manage the gross interest rate spread on these transactions 
we use interest rate swap agreements to convert the variable rate exposures on securities issued by our securitization trusts to a fixed rate  thereby locking in the gross interest rate spread to be earned by us over the life of a securitization 
interest rate swap agreements purchased by us do not impact the amount of cash flows to be received by holders of the asset backed securities issued by the trusts 
the interest rate swap agreements serve to offset the impact of increased or decreased interest paid by the trusts on floating rate asset backed securities on the cash flows to be received by us from the trusts 
we utilize such arrangements to modify our net interest sensitivity to levels deemed appropriate based on our risk tolerance 
in circumstances where the interest rate risk is deemed to be tolerable  usually if the risk is less than one year in term at inception  we may choose 
table of contents not to hedge potential fluctuations in cash flows due to changes in interest rates 
our special purpose finance subsidiaries are contractually required to purchase a financial instrument to protect the net spread in connection with the issuance of floating rate securities even if we choose not to hedge our future cash flows 
although the interest rate cap agreements are purchased by the trusts  cash outflows from the trusts ultimately impact our retained interests in the securitization transactions as cash expended by the securitization trusts will decrease the ultimate amount of cash to be received by us 
therefore  when economically feasible  we may simultaneously sell a corresponding interest rate cap agreement to offset the premium paid by the trust to purchase the interest rate cap agreement 
the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements purchased by the special purpose finance subsidiaries in connection with securitization transactions are included in other assets and the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements sold by us are included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements are reflected in interest expense on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
pre funding securitizations is the practice of issuing more asset backed securities than needed to cover finance receivables initially sold or pledged to the trust 
the proceeds from the pre funded portion are held in an escrow account until additional receivables are delivered to the trust in amounts up to the pre funded balance held in the escrow account 
the use of pre funded securitizations allows us to lock in borrowing costs with respect to the finance receivables subsequently delivered to the trust 
however  we incur an expense in pre funded securitizations during the period between the initial delivery of finance receivables and the subsequent delivery of finance receivables equal to the difference between the interest earned on the proceeds held in the escrow account and the interest rate paid on the asset backed securities outstanding 
additionally  in may  we issued a revolving securitization transaction that allows us to replace receivables as they amortize down rather than paying down the outstanding debt balance for a period of one year subject to compliance with certain covenants 
the use of this type of transaction allows us to lock in borrowing costs for the revolving period and allows us to finance approximately more receivables than in our typical amortizing securitization structure at that borrowing cost 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in interest payments on our three most recent securitization transactions 
portions of these interest rate swap agreements are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges
