overview net loss for was million  or per share  including a million pre tax  or per share after tax  charge for store closures and other restructuring costs 
this compares to net loss for of million  or per share  including charges related to unusual items of million pre tax  or per share after tax 
for a description of these items  see results of operations compared to net sales were million in  compared to million in we achieved record annual operating cash flow of million in our debt to capital ratio decreased to at year end  compared to at year end merchandise inventories at year end decreased by million  or  compared to year end comparable store sales for increased 
we define comparable store sales as sales from stores that have been open at least months and where selling square footage did not change by more than in the previous months 

table of contents we continue to focus on key initiatives designed to position the company for sustained  long term growth and profitability 
we remain committed to controlling our expense structure 
during  we closed lower performing stores  consolidated our call center operations and made corresponding adjustments to our workforce 
in  we plan to open a small number of new stores and close a similar number of stores as lower performing store leases expire 
we plan to continue our focus on broad  targeted merchandise assortments in order to grow future revenues of our stores  direct sales and port supply businesses while continuing to improve inventory productivity 
we intend to manage expenses with discipline  invest where we expect a return and build on the core foundation changes we made in we have restated our previously reported financial results 
while the corrections we made had no impact on cash flows  they did affect our balance sheets and statements of operations  with the impact on annual results primarily affecting fiscal years and restatement in connection with an examination of changes in our business model  including refinements we have made  and will continue to make in our supply chain practices and inventory management  we reevaluated our approach to capitalizing indirect inventory costs 
during the course of our examination  we determined that we had incorrectly capitalized a portion of these indirect costs in inventory value  and we further determined that in our fiscal year adoption of a new accounting pronouncement  eitf  we did not appropriately report the cumulative effect of such adoption  requiring correction of our previously issued financial statements 
as a result  we have restated our consolidated financial statements for fiscal years   and  and our quarterly information for fiscal years and the first three quarters of  presented in this report 
the correction had the effect of increasing previously reported net income for the first three quarters of by million 
the restatement of prior periods had the effect of increasing net loss in by million  decreasing net income in by million  decreasing net income before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in by million and decreasing net income after cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in by million  decreasing net income in by million and decreasing cumulative net income for years prior to by million

all information in this item gives effect to the restatement 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of west marine s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  in item of this report 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies  which are described below 
lease accounting 
our accounting practices and policies with respect to leasing transactions include recording rent expense starting on the date we gain possession of leased property  conforming the lease term used in calculating straight line rent expense with the term used to amortize improvements on leased property  and recording tenant improvement allowances received from landlords as an adjustment to deferred rent  reducing 
table of contents straight line rent expense 
certain of our operating leases contain periods of free or reduced rent or contain predetermined fixed increases in the minimum rent amount during the lease term 
for these leases  we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected minimum life of the lease  generally about ten years  including periods of free rent  and record the difference between the amount charged to rent expense and the rent paid as deferred rent 
tenant improvement allowances received from landlords generally are treated as deferred rent adjustments  reducing straight line rent expense over the life of the lease 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue at the time the products are received by the customers in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements as amended by sab  revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized for store sales at the point at which the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register 
for direct sales  revenue is recognized at the time the customer receives the product 
customers typically receive goods within three days of shipment 
shipping charges billed to customers are included in net sales 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns based on historical return trends 
if actual returns are greater than those projected  additional sales returns may be recorded in the future 
discounts offered to customers consist primarily of point of sale markdowns and are recorded at the time of the related sale as a reduction of revenue 
gift cards sold or issued for store credit in exchange for returned goods are carried as a liability and revenue is recognized as amounts under the gift card are redeemed 
the value of points and awards under our loyalty programs are recorded as a liability and deducted from revenue at the time the points and awards are earned  based on historical conversion and redemption rates 
the associated revenue is recognized when the rewards are redeemed or expire 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas r share based payment and began recognizing compensation expense for its stock based payments based on the fair value of the awards under the modified prospective application method 
stock based payments consist of stock option grants  restricted share awards and stock purchase plan issuances 
the effect of the adoption of sfas r on future results will depend  among other things  on levels of stock based payments granted in the future  actual forfeiture rates and the timing of option exercises 
for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements  in item of this report 
merchandise inventories and vendor allowances 
our merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis 
inventory cost includes certain indirect costs related to the purchasing  transportation and warehousing of merchandise 
capitalized indirect costs include freight charges for moving merchandise to warehouses or store selling locations and operating costs of our merchandising  replenishment and distribution activities 
indirect costs included in inventory value at the end of and were million and million  respectively 
we recognize indirect costs included in inventory value as an increase in cost of goods sold as the related products are sold 
we make certain assumptions based upon historical experience and current information to adjust inventory value for estimated shrinkage and to adjust inventory value to the lower of cost or market 
our reserve for estimated inventory shrinkage is based on historical shrinkage rates determined by the company s physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts and was million and million at the end of fiscal years and  respectively 
inventories are written down to market value when cost exceeds market value  which we estimate using current levels of aged and discontinued product and historical analysis of inventory sold below cost 
our reserve for estimated inventory market value below cost at the end of and was million and million  respectively 
we receive consideration from a variety of vendor sponsored programs and arrangements such as volume rebates  markdown allowances  promotions and payment terms discounts 
vendor allowances related to merchandise purchases are treated as a reduction of inventory value and recognized as a reduction in cost of goods sold as the related products are sold 

table of contents we establish a receivable for income generated from vendor sponsored programs that is earned but not yet received from our vendors  which we calculate based on provisions of the programs in place 
due to the complexity and diversity of the individual agreements with vendors  we perform detailed analyses and review historical trends to determine an appropriate level of the receivable 
impairment of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded  if required  for the portion of the asset s carrying value that exceeds the asset s estimated fair value 
we may also accelerate depreciation over the asset s revised useful life  if appropriate 
when evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment  we group and evaluate assets at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified 
we group and evaluate store assets for impairment at the individual store level 
we compare asset carrying values to the store s estimated future cash flows 
in we recognized an impairment charge of million to reduce impaired store assets to their estimated fair values 
for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements  in item of this report 
asset retirement obligations and facility closing costs 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  we estimate the fair value of our obligations to clean up and restore leased properties under our agreements with landlords and record the amount as a liability when incurred 
we account for closed store and warehouse lease termination costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
in the period we close a store or warehouse  we write off the book value of any abandoned leasehold improvements and record as an obligation the present value of estimated costs that will not be recovered 
these costs include future lease payments  less any expected sublease income 
these costs could increase or decrease based upon general economic conditions  circumstances in specific locations  our ability to sublease facilities and the accuracy of our related estimates 
in  we recognized charges of million in conjunction with store closings and the relocation of certain direct sales call center operations  including a million asset impairment charge 
for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements  in item of this report 
self insurance 
we are self insured for certain losses related to employee medical claims  workers compensation and general liability 
our reserve is developed based on historical claims data and includes an assessment of self insured losses that are incurred but not reported as of the end of the period 
the resulting estimate is recorded as a liability 
our assumptions are reviewed periodically and compared with actual claims experience and external benchmarks to ensure that our reserves are appropriate 
income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income  state tax apportionment and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
our tax filings are subject to audit by authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business  which may result in assessments of additional taxes  penalties and interest 
we believe we have adequately provided for obligations that would result from these legal and or tax proceedings that result from these audits where it is probable we will pay some amounts and the amounts can be estimated  in some cases  however  it is too early to predict a final outcome

results varied significantly between the first half and the second half of the year 
decreases in comparable store sales of  and  during the first  second  and third quarters  respectively  were offset by an increase of during the fourth quarter 
we attribute the decrease in comparable store sales to a number of factors 
high fuel costs persisted throughout much of the year  reducing boating frequency and the length of time people spent on their boats 
during the first and second quarters  extended cold  wet  winter like weather produced an unusually late starting and abbreviated boating season in the northeast  mid atlantic and great lakes areas 
during the third quarter and part of the fourth quarter  a record number of hurricanes hit our key southeast region  including hurricane katrina  which destroyed four of our stores  and hurricane wilma  which devastated large areas of florida with large boating populations 
in addition  post katrina consumer doldrums further dampened recreational spending across the country 
gross profit gross profit decreased million  or  in  compared to gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in  primarily due to a million reduction in vendor allowances earned on merchandise purchased during  associated with an initiative to reduce inventory levels  as well as lower gross margins due to an initiative to lower retail prices on certain products

upon obtaining a new credit facility in  we recorded a million charge to write off the unamortized portion of loan costs related to our prior credit facility 
income taxes our income tax rate of of pre tax loss in improved from of pre tax income in  primarily due to a state tax benefit in relating to enterprise zone credits 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our cash needs primarily are for working capital to support our inventory requirements and capital expenditures  pre opening expenses and beginning inventory for new stores and for remodeling or relocating older stores 
we also may require additional capital in the event we choose to pursue acquisition opportunities 
we believe our existing credit facilities and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs through operating activities during  our primary source of liquidity was cash flow from operations 
net cash provided by operations during was million  primarily consisting of net income  excluding depreciation and amortization of million and a million decrease in inventory  primarily due to the implementation of inventory management initiatives

all but a limited number of our purchase commitments  which are not material  are cancelable by us without penalty 
we are party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and obligate us to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events  such as delivery of functioning software products 
because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements  no such amounts have been included in the table above 
we have also excluded associate employment commitments 
off balance sheet arrangements operating leases are the only financing arrangements not reported on our consolidated balance sheets 
we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as special purpose entities or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any unconsolidated special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
seasonality historically  our business has been highly seasonal 
in  approximately of our net sales and all of our net income occurred during the second and third quarters  principally during the period from april through august  which represents the peak months for boat buying  usage and maintenance in most of our markets 
management expects the seasonal fluctuation in net sales to become more pronounced as we continue to expand our operations
