economic overview in  the us economic performance was healthy as real gross domestic product grew an estimated annualized percent 
consumer spending remained resilient despite significant declines in housing and mortgage refinancing activities 
global economies recorded another solid year of growth  led by robust expansion in asia 
importantly  germany and japan maintained their economic momentum as the us weathered a soft patch in growth 
the frb concluded two consecutive years of rate hikes in june  raising its rate to percent  as increases remained on hold in the second half of the year 
the yield curve remained inverted for much of the second half of the year  reflecting the frb s rate increases  its inflation fighting credibility  and rising foreign capital inflows 
in response to the rate hikes and removal of monetary accommodation  housing sales and construction fell sharply  median house prices flattened after surging for a half decade  and mortgage refinancing activity fell sharply 
however  business investment remained strong  and solid increases in nonresidential 
table of contents construction partially offset the declines in housing 
consumer spending  buoyed by rising personal incomes  relative low interest rates and record breaking wealth  continued to grow  ending the year on a strong note 
dramatic declines in oil and energy prices in august through october sharply reduced inflation  while core measures of inflation  excluding the volatile energy and food components  rose through september 
core inflation drifted modestly lower through year end  but remained above the two percent upper bound of the frb s comfort range 
with the exception of housing  automobiles and related industries sustained healthy product demand and modest pricing power provided businesses record profits 
in this environment  businesses continued to hire  and the unemployment rate receded to percent  well below its historic average

net interest income increased primarily due to the mbna merger and organic growth which increased average loans and leases 
noninterest income increased primarily due to the mbna merger which resulted in an increase in card income driven by increases in excess servicing income  cash advance fees  interchange income and late fees 
these increases were partially offset by higher noninterest expense and provision for credit losses  primarily driven by the addition of mbna

these increases were partially offset by a lower contribution from market based earning assets and the higher costs associated with higher levels of wholesale funding 
the net interest yield on a fte basis decreased two basis points bps to percent in due primarily to an increase in lower yielding market based earning assets and loan spreads that continued to tighten due to the flat to inverted yield curve 
these decreases were partially offset by widening of spreads on core deposits

table of contents supplemental financial data table provides a reconciliation of the supplemental financial data mentioned below with financial measures defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently 
operating basis presentation in managing our business  we may at times look at performance excluding certain nonrecurring items 
for example  as an alternative to net income  we view results on an operating basis  which represents net income excluding merger and restructuring charges 
the operating basis of presentation is not defined by gaap 
we believe that the exclusion of merger and restructuring charges  which represent events outside our normal operations  provides a meaningful year to year comparison and is more reflective of normalized operations 
net interest income fte basis in addition  we view net interest income and related ratios and analysis ie  efficiency ratio  net interest yield and operating leverage on a fte basis 
although this is a non gaap measure  we believe managing the business with net interest income on a fte basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes 
to derive the fte basis  net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax exempt income on an equivalent before tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense 
for purposes of this calculation  we use the federal statutory tax rate of percent 
this measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources 
performance measures as mentioned above  certain performance measures including the efficiency ratio  net interest yield and operating leverage utilize net interest income and thus total revenue on a fte basis 
the efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue  and net interest yield evaluates how many basis points we are earning over the cost of funds 
operating leverage measures the total percentage revenue growth minus the total percentage expense growth for the corresponding period 
during our annual integrated planning process  we set operating leverage and efficiency targets for the corporation and each line of business 
we believe the use of these non gaap measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the corporation 
targets vary by year and by business  and are based on a variety of factors including maturity of the business  investment appetite  competitive environment  market factors  and other items eg  risk appetite 
the aforementioned performance measures and ratios  earnings per common share eps  return on average assets  and dividend payout ratio  as well as those measures discussed more fully below  are presented in table return on average common shareholders equity  return on average tangible shareholders equity and shareholder value added we also evaluate our business based upon return on average common shareholders equity roe  return on average tangible shareholders equity rote  and shareholder value added sva measures 
roe  rote and sva utilize non gaap allocation methodologies 
roe measures the earnings contribution of a unit as a percentage of the shareholders equity allocated to that unit 
rote measures the earnings contribution of the corporation as a percentage of shareholders equity reduced by goodwill 
sva is defined as cash basis earnings on an operating basis less a charge for the use of capital 
these measures are used to evaluate our use of equity ie  capital at the individual unit level and are integral components in the analytics for resource allocation 
we believe using sva as a performance measure places specific focus on whether incremental investments generate returns in excess of the costs of capital associated with those investments 
in addition  profitability  relationship  and investment models all use roe and sva as key measures to support our overall growth goal

table of contents core net interest income managed basis in managing our business  we review core net interest income managed basis  which adjusts reported net interest income on a fte basis for the impact of market based activities and certain securitizations  net of retained securities 
as discussed in the global corporate and investment banking business segment section beginning on page  we evaluate our market based results and strategies on a total market based revenue approach by combining net interest income and noninterest income for the capital markets and advisory services business 
we also adjust for loans that we originated and sold into certain securitizations 
these securitizations include off balance sheet loans and leases  specifically those loans in revolving securitizations and other securitizations where servicing is retained by the corporation eg  credit card and home equity lines 
noninterest income  rather than net interest income and provision for credit losses  is recorded for assets that have been securitized as we are compensated for servicing the securitized assets and record servicing income and gains or losses on securitizations  where appropriate 
we believe the use of this non gaap presentation provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the corporation 
an analysis of core net interest income managed basis  core average earning assets managed basis and core net interest yield on earning assets managed basis  which adjusts for the impact of these two non core items from reported net interest income on a fte basis  is shown below 
table core net interest income managed basis dollars in millions net interest income as reported fte basis impact of market based net interest income core net interest income impact of securitizations core net interest income managed basis average earning assets as reported impact of market based earning assets core average earning assets impact of securitizations core average earning assets managed basis net interest yield contribution as reported fte basis impact of market based activities core net interest yield on earning assets impact of securitizations core net interest yield on earning assets managed basis represents amounts from the capital markets and advisory services business within global corporate and investment banking 
core net interest income on a managed basis increased billion 
this increase was primarily driven by the impact of the mbna merger volumes and spreads  consumer primarily home equity and commercial loan growth  and increases in the benefits from alm activities  including increased portfolio balances primarily residential mortgages and the impact of changes in spreads across all product categories 
partially offsetting these increases was the higher costs associated with higher levels of wholesale funding 
on a managed basis  core average earning assets increased billion primarily due to the impact of the mbna merger  higher levels of consumer and commercial loans from organic growth and higher alm levels primarily residential mortgages 
core net interest yield on a managed basis increased bps as a result of the impact of the mbna merger volumes and spreads and core deposit spread widening  partially offset by loan spread compression due to the flat to inverted yield curve and increased costs associated with higher levels of wholesale funding 

table of contents business segment operations segment description the corporation reports the results of its operations through three business segments global consumer and small business banking  global corporate and investment banking  and global wealth and investment management 
all other consists of equity investment activities including principal investing  corporate investments and strategic investments  the residual impact of the allowance for credit losses and the cost allocation processes  merger and restructuring charges  intersegment eliminations  and the results of certain consumer finance and commercial lending businesses that are being liquidated 
all other also includes certain amounts associated with alm activities  including the residual impact of funds transfer pricing allocation methodologies  amounts associated with the change in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations that do not qualify for statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas hedge accounting treatment  certain gains or losses on sales of whole mortgage loans  and gains losses on sales of debt securities 
basis of presentation we prepare and evaluate segment results using certain non gaap methodologies and performance measures  many of which are discussed in supplemental financial data beginning on page we begin by evaluating the operating results of the businesses which by definition excludes merger and restructuring charges 
the segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies which are utilized to determine operating income 
the net interest income of the businesses includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics 
the management accounting reporting process derives segment and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue  expense and capital 
the net income derived for the businesses are dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an activity based costing model  funds transfer pricing  other methodologies  and assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business 
the corporation s alm activities maintain an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate volatility 
the corporation s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect net interest income 
the results of the business segments will fluctuate based on the performance of corporate alm activities 
some alm activities are recorded in the businesses ie  deposits such as external product pricing decisions  including deposit pricing strategies  as well as the effects of our internal funds transfer pricing process and other alm actions such as portfolio positioning 
the net effects of other alm activities are reported in each of the corporation s segments under alm other 
in addition  any residual effect of the funds transfer pricing process is retained in all other 
certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific business segment are allocated to the segments based on pre determined means 
the most significant of these expenses include data processing costs  item processing costs and certain centralized or shared functions 
data processing costs are allocated to the segments based on equipment usage 
item processing costs are allocated to the segments based on the volume of items processed for each segment 
the costs of certain centralized or shared functions are allocated based on methodologies which reflect utilization 
equity is allocated to business segments and related businesses using a risk adjusted methodology incorporating each unit s credit  market  interest rate and operational risk components 
the nature of these risks is discussed further beginning on page roe is calculated by dividing net income by average allocated equity 
sva is defined as cash basis earnings on an operating basis less a charge for the use of capital ie  equity 
cash basis earnings on an operating basis is defined as net income adjusted to exclude merger and restructuring charges and amortization of intangibles 
the charge for capital is calculated by multiplying percent management s estimate of the shareholders minimum required rate of return on capital invested by average total common shareholders equity at the corporate level and by average allocated equity at the business segment level 
average equity is allocated to the business level using a methodology identical to that used in the roe calculation 
management reviews the estimate of the rate used to calculate the capital charge annually 
the capital asset pricing model is used to estimate our cost of capital

accordingly  for segment reporting purposes  the businesses received in the neutralizing benefit to net interest income related to certain of the economic hedges previously mentioned  with the offset recorded in other 
other also includes adjustments in noninterest income and income tax expense to remove the fte impact of items primarily low income housing tax credits that have been grossed up within noninterest income to a fully taxable equivalent amount in the other segments 
net income increased million  or three percent  primarily due to increases in equity investment gains  net interest income  decreases in provision for credit losses  and all other noninterest expense 
these changes were largely offset by a decrease in gains losses on sales of debt securities and an increase in merger and restructuring charges 
the increase in net interest income of million is due primarily to the million negative impact to results retained in all other relating to funds transfer pricing that was not allocated to the businesses 
equity investment gains increased million due to favorable market conditions driving liquidity in the principal investing portfolio as well as a million gain recorded on the liquidation of a strategic european investment 
provision for credit losses decreased million to a negative million 
in a million reserve for estimated losses associated with hurricane katrina was established 
we did not incur significant losses from hurricane katrina and  therefore  released the previously established reserve in the decrease in gains losses on sales of debt securities of billion resulted from a loss on the sale of mortgage backed securities  which was driven by a decision to hold a lower level of investments in securities relative to loans see interest rate risk management securities on page for further discussion  compared with gains recorded on the sales of mortgage backed securities in merger and restructuring charges were million in compared to million in the charge in was due to the mbna merger whereas the charge was primarily related to the fleetboston merger 
see note of consolidated financial statements for further information associated with the mbna merger 
the decline in all other noninterest expense of million is due to decreases in unallocated residual general operating expenses 
income tax expense benefit was million in compared to million in this change was driven by both a million cumulative tax charge in resulting from the change in tax legislation relating to the extraterritorial income and foreign sales corporation regimes and by higher pre tax income 

table of contents off and on balance sheet financing entities off balance sheet commercial paper conduits in addition to traditional lending  we also support our customers financing needs by facilitating their access to the commercial paper markets 
these markets provide an attractive  lower cost financing alternative for our customers 
our customers sell or otherwise transfer assets  such as high grade trade or other receivables or leases  to a commercial paper financing entity  which in turn issues high grade short term commercial paper that is collateralized by the underlying assets 
we facilitate these transactions and collect fees from the financing entity for the services it provides including administration  trust services and marketing the commercial paper 
we receive fees for providing combinations of liquidity and standby letters of credit sblcs or similar loss protection commitments to the commercial paper financing entities 
these forms of asset support are senior to the first layer of asset support provided by customers through over collateralization or by support provided by third parties 
the rating agencies require that a certain percentage of the commercial paper entity s assets be supported by the seller s over collateralization and our sblc in order to receive their respective investment rating 
the sblc would be drawn on only when the over collateralization provided by the seller is not sufficient to cover losses of the related asset 
liquidity commitments made to the commercial paper entity are designed to fund scheduled redemptions of commercial paper if there is a market disruption or the new commercial paper cannot be issued to fund the redemption of the maturing commercial paper 
the liquidity facility has the same legal priority as the commercial paper 
we do not enter into any other form of guarantee with these entities 
we manage our credit risk on these commitments by subjecting them to our normal underwriting and risk management processes 
at december  and  we had off balance sheet liquidity commitments and sblcs to these entities of billion and billion 
substantially all of these liquidity commitments and sblcs mature within one year 
these amounts are included in table net revenues earned from fees associated with these off balance sheet financing entities were million and million in and from time to time  we may purchase some of the commercial paper issued by certain of these entities for our own account or acting as a dealer on behalf of third parties

in accordance with fin r  the primary beneficiary is the party that consolidates a vie based on its assessment that it will absorb a majority of the expected losses or expected residual returns of the entity  or both 
we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of the commercial paper conduits described above and  therefore  have not included the assets and liabilities or results of operations of these conduits in the consolidated financial statements of the corporation 
on balance sheet commercial paper conduits in addition to the off balance sheet financing entities previously described  we also utilize commercial paper conduits that have been consolidated based on our determination that we are the primary beneficiary of the entities in accordance with fin r 
at december  and  the consolidated assets and liabilities of these conduits were reflected in afs securities  other assets  and commercial paper and other short term borrowings in global corporate and investment banking 
at december  and  we held billion and billion of assets of these entities while our 
table of contents maximum loss exposure associated with these entities  including unfunded lending commitments  was approximately billion and billion 
we manage our credit risk on the on balance sheet commitments by subjecting them to the same processes as the off balance sheet commitments 
commercial paper qualified special purpose entities to manage our capital position and diversify funding sources  we will  from time to time  sell assets to off balance sheet entities that obtain financing by issuing commercial paper or notes with similar repricing characteristics to investors 
these entities are qualified special purpose entities qspes that have been isolated beyond our reach or that of our creditors  even in the event of bankruptcy or other receivership 
the accounting for these entities is governed by sfas  which provides that qspes are not included in the consolidated financial statements of the seller 
assets sold to the entities consist of high grade corporate or municipal bonds  collateralized debt obligations and asset backed securities 
these entities issue collateralized commercial paper or notes with similar repricing characteristics to third party market participants and enter into passive derivative instruments with us 
assets sold to these entities typically have an investment rating ranging from aaa aaa to aa aa 
we may provide liquidity  sblcs or similar loss protection commitments to these entities  or we may enter into derivatives with these entities in which we assume certain risks 
the liquidity facility and derivatives have the same legal standing with the commercial paper 
the derivatives provide interest rate  currency and a pre specified amount of credit protection to the entity in exchange for the commercial paper rate 
these derivatives are provided for in the legal documents and help to alleviate any cash flow mismatches 
in some cases  if an asset s rating declines below a certain investment quality as evidenced by its investment rating or defaults  we are no longer exposed to the risk of loss 
at that time  the commercial paper holders assume the risk of loss 
in other cases  we agree to assume all of the credit exposure related to the referenced asset 
legal documents for each entity specify asset quality levels that require the entity to automatically dispose of the asset once the asset falls below the specified quality rating 
at the time the asset is disposed  we are required to reimburse the entity for any credit related losses depending on the pre specified level of protection provided 
we manage any credit or market risk on commitments or derivatives through normal underwriting and risk management processes 
at december  and  we had off balance sheet liquidity commitments  sblcs and other financial guarantees to these entities of billion and billion  for which we received fees of million and million for and substantially all of these commitments mature within one year and are included in table derivative activity related to these entities is included in note of the consolidated financial statements 
we generally do not purchase any of the commercial paper issued by these types of financing entities other than during the underwriting process when we act as issuing agent nor do we purchase any of the commercial paper for our own account 
derivative instruments related to these entities are marked to market through the consolidated statement of income 
sblcs are initially recorded at fair value in accordance with fin liquidity commitments and sblcs subsequent to inception are accounted for pursuant to sfas and are discussed further in note of the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  as a result of the mbna merger on january   the corporation acquired interests in off balance sheet credit card securitization vehicles which issue both commercial paper and medium term notes 
we hold subordinated interests issued by these entities  which are qspes  but do not otherwise provide liquidity or other forms of loss protection to these vehicles 
for additional information on credit card securitizations  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
credit and liquidity risks because we provide liquidity and credit support to the commercial paper conduits and qspes described above  our credit ratings and changes thereto will affect the borrowing cost and liquidity of these entities 
in addition  significant changes in counterparty asset valuation and credit standing may also affect the liquidity of the commercial paper issuance 
disruption in the commercial paper markets may result in the corporation having to fund under these commitments and sblcs discussed above 
we seek to manage these risks  along with all other credit and liquidity risks  within our policies and practices 
see notes and of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of off balance sheet financing entities 

table of contents other off balance sheet financing entities to improve our capital position and diversify funding sources  we also sell assets  primarily loans  to other off balance sheet qspes that obtain financing primarily by issuing term notes 
we may retain a portion of the investment grade notes issued by these entities  and we may also retain subordinated interests in the entities which reduce the credit risk of the senior investors 
we may provide liquidity support in the form of foreign exchange or interest rate swaps 
we generally do not provide other forms of credit support to these entities  which are described more fully in note of the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the above  we had significant involvement with vies other than the commercial paper conduits 
these vies were not consolidated because we will not absorb a majority of the expected losses or expected residual returns and are therefore not the primary beneficiary of the vies 
these entities are described more fully in note of the consolidated financial statements 
obligations and commitments we have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements 
additionally  in the normal course of business  we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties 
obligations that are legally binding agreements whereby we agree to purchase products or services with a specific minimum quantity defined at a fixed  minimum or variable price over a specified period of time are defined as purchase obligations 
included in purchase obligations are vendor contracts of billion  commitments to purchase securities of billion and commitments to purchase loans of billion 
the most significant of our vendor contracts include communication services  processing services and software contracts

managing risk overview our management governance structure enables us to manage all major aspects of our business through an integrated planning and review process that includes strategic  financial  associate  customer and risk planning 
we derive much of our revenue from managing risk from customer transactions for profit 
in addition to qualitative factors  we utilize quantitative measures to optimize risk and reward trade offs in order to achieve growth targets and financial objectives while reducing the variability of earnings and minimizing unexpected losses 
risk metrics that allow us to measure performance include economic capital targets  sva targets and corporate risk limits 
by allocating economic capital to a business unit  we effectively define that unit s ability to take on risk 
review and approval of business plans incorporates approval of economic capital allocation  and economic capital usage is monitored through financial and risk reporting 
country  trading  asset allocation and other limits supplement the allocation of economic capital 
these limits are based on an analysis of risk and reward in each business unit and management is responsible for tracking and reporting performance measurements as well as any exceptions to guidelines or limits 
our risk management process continually evaluates risk and appropriate metrics needed to measure it 
our business exposes us to the following major risks strategic  liquidity  credit  market and operational 
strategic risk is the risk that adverse business decisions  ineffective or inappropriate business plans or failure to respond to changes in the competitive environment  business cycles  customer preferences  product obsolescence  execution and or other intrinsic risks of business will impact our ability to meet our objectives 
liquidity risk is the inability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals  fund asset growth and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates 
credit risk is the risk of loss arising from a borrower s or counterparty s inability to meet its obligations 
market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions  such as interest rate movements 
operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems or external events 
the following sections  strategic risk management  liquidity risk and capital management  credit risk management beginning on page  market risk management beginning on page and operational risk management beginning on page  address in more detail the specific procedures  measures and analyses of the major categories of risk that we manage 

table of contents risk management processes and methods we have established control processes and use various methods to align risk taking and risk management throughout our organization 
these control processes and methods are designed around three lines of defense lines of business  enterprise functions including risk management  compliance  finance  human resources and legal  and corporate audit 
the lines of business are the first line of defense and are responsible for identifying  quantifying  mitigating and managing all risks within their lines of business  while certain enterprise wide risks are managed centrally 
for example  except for trading related business activities  interest rate risk associated with our business activities is managed in the corporate treasury and corporate investment functions 
line of business management makes and executes the business plan and is closest to the changing nature of risks and  therefore  we believe is best able to take actions to manage and mitigate those risks 
our lines of business prepare periodic self assessment reports to identify the status of risk issues  including mitigation plans  if appropriate 
these reports roll up to executive management to ensure appropriate risk management and oversight  and to identify enterprise wide issues 
our management processes  structures and policies aid us in complying with laws and regulations and provide clear lines for decision making and accountability 
wherever practical  we attempt to house decision making authority as close to the transaction as possible while retaining supervisory control functions from both in and outside of the lines of business 
the key elements of the second line of defense are risk management  compliance  finance  global technology and operations  human resources  and legal functions 
these groups are independent of the lines of businesses and are organized on both a line of business and enterprise wide basis 
for example  for risk management  a senior risk executive is assigned to each of the lines of business and is responsible for the oversight of all the risks associated with that line of business 
enterprise level risk executives have responsibility to develop and implement polices and practices to assess and manage enterprise wide credit  market and operational risks 
corporate audit  the third line of defense  provides an independent assessment of our management and internal control systems 
corporate audit activities are designed to provide reasonable assurance that resources are adequately protected  significant financial  managerial and operating information is materially complete  accurate and reliable  and employees actions are in compliance with corporate policies  standards  procedures  and applicable laws and regulations 
we use various methods to manage risks at the line of business levels and corporate wide 
examples of these methods include planning and forecasting  risk committees and forums  limits  models  and hedging strategies 
planning and forecasting facilitates analysis of actual versus planned results and provides an indication of unanticipated risk levels 
generally  risk committees and forums are composed of lines of business  risk management  treasury  compliance  legal and finance personnel  among others  who actively monitor performance against plan  limits  potential issues  and introduction of new products 
limits  the amount of exposure that may be taken in a product  relationship  region or industry  seek to align corporate wide risk goals with those of each line of business and are part of our overall risk management process to help reduce the volatility of market  credit and operational losses 
models are used to estimate market value and net interest income sensitivity  and to estimate expected and unexpected losses for each product and line of business  where appropriate 
hedging strategies are used to manage the risk of borrower or counterparty concentration risk and to manage market risk in the portfolio 
the formal processes used to manage risk represent only one portion of our overall risk management process 
corporate culture and the actions of our associates are also critical to effective risk management 
through our code of ethics  we set a high standard for our associates 
the code of ethics provides a framework for all of our associates to conduct themselves with the highest integrity in the delivery of our products or services to our customers 
we instill a risk conscious culture through communications  training  policies  procedures  and organizational roles and responsibilities 
additionally  we continue to strengthen the linkage between the associate performance management process and individual compensation to encourage associates to work toward corporate wide risk goals 
oversight the board oversees the risk management of the corporation through its committees  management committees and the chief executive officer 
the board s audit committee monitors the effectiveness of our internal controls  the 
table of contents integrity of our consolidated financial statements and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements 
in addition  the audit committee oversees the internal audit function and the independent registered public accountant 
the board s asset quality committee oversees credit risks and related topics that may impact our assets and earnings 
the finance committee  a management committee  oversees the development and performance of the policies and strategies for managing the strategic  credit  market  and operational risks to our earnings and capital 
the asset liability committee alco  a subcommittee of the finance committee  oversees our policies and processes designed to assure sound market risk and balance sheet management 
the compliance and operational risk committee  a subcommittee of the finance committee  oversees our policies and processes designed to assure sound operational and compliance risk management 
the credit risk committee crc  a subcommittee of the finance committee  oversees and approves our adherence to sound credit risk management policies and practices 
certain crc approvals are subject to the oversight of the board s asset quality committee 
the risk and capital committee  a management committee  reviews our corporate strategies and objectives  evaluates business performance  and reviews business plans including economic capital allocations to the corporation and business lines 
management continues to direct corporate wide efforts to address the basel committee on banking supervision s new risk based capital standards basel ii 
the audit committee and finance committee oversee management s plans to comply with basel ii 
for additional information  see basel ii on page and note of the consolidated financial statements 
strategic risk management we use an integrated planning process to help manage strategic risk 
a key component of the planning process aligns strategies  goals  tactics and resources throughout the enterprise 
the process begins with the creation of a corporate wide business plan which incorporates an assessment of the strategic risks 
this business plan establishes the corporate strategic direction 
the planning process then cascades through the business units  creating business unit plans that are aligned with the corporation s strategic direction 
at each level  tactics and metrics are identified to measure success in achieving goals and assure adherence to the plans 
as part of this process  the business units continuously evaluate the impact of changing market and business conditions  and the overall risk in meeting objectives 
see the operational risk management section on page for a further description of this process 
corporate audit in turn monitors  and independently reviews and evaluates  the plans and measurement processes 
one of the key tools we use to manage strategic risk is economic capital allocation 
through the economic capital allocation process  we effectively manage each business unit s ability to take on risk 
review and approval of business plans incorporates approval of economic capital allocation  and economic capital usage is monitored through financial and risk reporting 
economic capital allocation plans for the business units are incorporated into the corporation s operating plan that is approved by the board on an annual basis 
liquidity risk and capital management liquidity risk liquidity is the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals  fund asset growth and business operations  and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates 
liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in our business operations or unanticipated events 
sources of liquidity include deposits and other customer based funding  and wholesale market based funding 
we manage liquidity at two levels 
the first is the liquidity of the parent company  which is the holding company that owns the banking and nonbanking subsidiaries 
the second is the liquidity of the banking subsidiaries 
the management of liquidity at both levels is essential because the parent company and banking subsidiaries each have different funding needs and sources  and each are subject to certain regulatory guidelines and requirements 
through alco  the finance committee is responsible for establishing our liquidity policy as well as approving operating and contingency procedures  and monitoring liquidity on an ongoing basis 
corporate treasury is responsible for planning and executing our funding activities and strategy 

table of contents in order to ensure adequate liquidity through the full range of potential operating environments and market conditions  we conduct our liquidity management and business activities in a manner that will preserve and enhance funding stability  flexibility  and diversity 
key components of this operating strategy include a strong focus on customer based funding  maintaining direct relationships with wholesale market funding providers  and maintaining the ability to liquefy certain assets when  and if  requirements warrant 
we develop and maintain contingency funding plans for both the parent company and bank liquidity positions 
these plans evaluate our liquidity position under various operating circumstances and allow us to ensure that we would be able to operate though a period of stress when access to normal sources of funding is constrained 
the plans project funding requirements during a potential period of stress  specify and quantify sources of liquidity  outline actions and procedures for effectively managing through the problem period  and define roles and responsibilities 
they are reviewed and approved annually by alco 
our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings 
the credit ratings of bank of america corporation and bank of america  na are reflected in the table below 
table credit ratings december  bank of america corporation bank of america  na senior debt subordinated debt commercial paper short term borrowings long term debt moody s aa aa p p aa standard poor s aa a a a aa fitch  inc aa a f f aa on february   standard poor s rating services raised their ratings on bank of america corporation s senior debt to aa and subordinated debt to aa while bank of america  n 
a 
s long term debt rating was raised to aa 
on february   fitch  inc raised their ratings on bank of america corporation s senior debt to aa and subordinated debt to aa while bank of america  n 
a 
s long term debt rating was raised to aa 
under normal business conditions  primary sources of funding for the parent company include dividends received from its banking and nonbanking subsidiaries  and proceeds from the issuance of senior and subordinated debt  as well as commercial paper and equity 
primary uses of funds for the parent company include repayment of maturing debt and commercial paper  share repurchases  dividends paid to shareholders  and subsidiary funding through capital or debt 
the parent company maintains a cushion of excess liquidity that would be sufficient to fully fund holding company and nonbank affiliate operations for an extended period during which funding from normal sources is disrupted 
the primary measure used to assess the parent company s liquidity is the time to required funding during such a period of liquidity disruption 
this measure assumes that the parent company is unable to generate funds from debt or equity issuance  receives no dividend income from subsidiaries  and no longer pays dividends to shareholders while continuing to meet nondiscretionary uses needed to maintain bank operations and repayment of contractual principal and interest payments owed by the parent company and affiliated companies 
under this scenario  the amount of time the parent company and its nonbank subsidiaries can operate and meet all obligations before the current liquid assets are exhausted is considered the time to required funding 
alco approves the target range set for this metric  in months  and monitors adherence to the target 
maintaining excess parent company cash ensures that time to required funding remains in the target range of to months and is the primary driver of the timing and amount of the corporation s debt issuances 
as of december  time to required funding was months compared to months at december  the reduction reflects the funding in in anticipation of the billion cash payment related to the mbna merger that was paid on january  combined with an increase in share repurchases 
the primary sources of funding for our banking subsidiaries include customer deposits and wholesale market based funding 
primary uses of funds for the banking subsidiaries include growth in the core asset portfolios  including loan demand  and in the alm portfolio 
we use the alm portfolio primarily to manage interest rate risk and liquidity risk 

table of contents one ratio that can be used to monitor the stability of funding composition is the loan to domestic deposit ratio 
this ratio reflects the percent of loans and leases that are funded by domestic core deposits  a relatively stable funding source 
a ratio below percent indicates that our loan portfolio is completely funded by domestic core deposits 
the ratio was percent at december  compared to percent at december  the increase was primarily attributable to the addition of mbna  organic growth in the loan and lease portfolio  and a decision to retain a larger share of mortgage production on the corporation s balance sheet 
the strength of our balance sheet is a result of rigorous financial and risk discipline 
our core deposit base  which is a low cost funding source  is often used to fund the purchase of incremental assets primarily loans and securities  the composition of which impacts our loan to deposit ratio 
mortgage backed securities and mortgage loans have prepayment risk which must be managed 
repricing of deposits is a key variable in this process 
the capital generated in excess of capital adequacy targets and to support business growth  is available for the payment of dividends and share repurchases 
alco determines prudent parameters for wholesale market based borrowing and regularly reviews the funding plan for the bank subsidiaries to ensure compliance with these parameters 
the contingency funding plan for the banking subsidiaries evaluates liquidity over a month period in a variety of business environment scenarios assuming different levels of earnings performance and credit ratings as well as public and investor relations factors 
funding exposure related to our role as liquidity provider to certain off balance sheet financing entities is also measured under a stress scenario 
in this analysis  ratings are downgraded such that the off balance sheet financing entities are not able to issue commercial paper and backup facilities that we provide are drawn upon 
in addition  potential draws on credit facilities to issuers with ratings below a certain level are analyzed to assess potential funding exposure 
we originate loans for retention on our balance sheet and for distribution 
as part of our originate to distribute strategy  commercial loan originations are distributed through syndication structures  and residential mortgages originated by mortgage and home equity are frequently distributed in the secondary market 
in connection with our balance sheet management activities  we may retain mortgage loans originated as well as purchase and sell loans based on our assessment of market conditions 
regulatory capital at december   the corporation operated its banking activities primarily under two charters bank of america  na and fia card services  na the surviving entity of the mbna america bank na and the bank of america  na usa merger as a regulated financial services company  we are governed by certain regulatory capital requirements 
at december   the corporation  bank of america  na and fia card services  na were classified as well capitalized for regulatory purposes  the highest classification 
at december   the corporation  bank of america  na and bank of america 
na usa were also classified as well capitalized for regulatory purposes 
there have been no conditions or events since december  that management believes have changed the corporation s  bank of america  na s and fia card services  na s capital classifications 
certain corporate sponsored trust companies which issue trust preferred securities trust securities are deconsolidated under fin r 
as a result  the trust securities are not included on our consolidated balance sheets 
on march   the frb issued risk based capital standards trust preferred securities and the definition of capital the final rule which allows trust securities to continue to qualify as tier capital with revised quantitative limits that would be effective after a five year transition period 
as a result  we continue to include trust securities in tier capital 
the final rule limits restricted core capital elements to percent for internationally active bank holding companies 
in addition  the frb revised the qualitative standards for capital instruments included in regulatory capital 
internationally active bank holding companies are those with consolidated assets greater than billion or on balance sheet exposure greater than billion 
at december   our restricted core capital elements comprised percent of total core capital elements 
we expect to be fully compliant with the revised limits prior to the implementation date of march  table reconciles the corporation s total shareholders equity to tier and total capital as defined by the regulations issued by the frb  the fdic  and the occ at december  and

the corporation anticipates that the implementation  of fasb staff position no 
fas  accounting for a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction  will reduce retained earnings and associated regulatory capital by approximately billion after tax as of january  the amount of the charge initially recorded will be recognized as income over the remaining terms  generally to years  of the affected leases 
further  this change in accounting will also result in an adverse impact on earnings in the first two years subsequent to the change 
the corporation expects that net income will be negatively impacted by approximately million in the corporation anticipates that its tier and total capital ratios will be negatively impacted by approximately bps and its tier leverage ratio will be negatively impacted by approximately bps as a result of the initial adoption 
in november  the corporation announced a definitive agreement to acquire us trust for billion in cash 
the transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of the corporation anticipates that its tier and total capital ratios will be negatively impacted by approximately bps and its tier leverage ratio will be negatively impacted by approximately bps upon the acquisition of us trust 
basel ii in june  basel ii was published with the intent of more closely aligning regulatory capital requirements with underlying risks 
similar to economic capital measures  basel ii seeks to address credit risk  market risk  and operational risk 
while economic capital is measured to cover unexpected losses  the corporation also maintains a certain threshold in terms of regulatory capital to adhere to legal standards of capital adequacy 
these thresholds or leverage ratios will continue to be utilized for the foreseeable future 
us banks are required to implement basel ii within three years of the date the final rules are published 
banks must successfully complete four consecutive quarters of parallel calculations to be considered compliant and to enter a three year implementation period 
the three year implementation period is subject to capital relief floors limits that are set to help mitigate substantial decreases in an institution s capital levels when compared to current regulatory capital rules 

table of contents on september   the agencies officially published several documents providing updates to the basel ii risk based capital standards for the us as well as new regulatory reporting requirements related to these risk based capital standards for review and comment by us based banks and trade associations 
these publications included previously published regulations and guidance as well as revised market risk rules and a proposal including several new regulatory reporting templates 
these capital standards are expected to be finalized in the corporation continues its execution efforts to ensure preparedness with basel ii requirements 
the goal is to achieve full compliance within the three year implementation period 
further  the corporation anticipates being ready for all international reporting requirements that occur before that time 
dividends effective for the third quarter dividend  the board increased the quarterly cash dividend percent from to per share 
in october  the board declared a fourth quarter cash dividend of which was paid on december  to common shareholders of record on december  in january  the board declared a quarterly cash dividend of per common share payable on march  to shareholders of record on march  in january  the board also declared three dividends in regards to preferred stock

table of contents credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations 
credit risk can also arise from operational failures that result in an advance  commitment or investment of funds 
we define the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the loss potential arising from all product classifications including loans and leases  derivatives  trading account assets  assets held for sale  and unfunded lending commitments that include loan commitments  letters of credit and financial guarantees 
for derivative positions  our credit risk is measured as the net replacement cost in the event the counterparties with contracts in a gain position to us fail to perform under the terms of those contracts 
we use the current mark to market value to represent credit exposure without giving consideration to future mark to market changes 
the credit risk amounts take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral 
our consumer and commercial credit extension and review procedures take into account funded and unfunded credit exposures 
for additional information on derivatives and credit extension commitments  see notes and of the consolidated financial statements 
for credit risk purposes  we evaluate our consumer businesses on both a held and managed basis a non gaap measure 
managed basis treats securitized loan receivables as if they were still on the balance sheet 
we evaluate credit performance on a managed basis as the receivables that have been securitized are subject to the same underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring as the held loans 
in addition to the discussion of credit quality statistics of both held and managed loans included in this section  refer to the card services discussion beginning on page for additional information on our managed portfolio and securitizations  refer to note of the consolidated financial statements 
we manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower or counterparty  repayment sources  the nature of underlying collateral  and other support given current events  conditions and expectations 
we classify our portfolios as either consumer or commercial and monitor credit risk separately as discussed below 
consumer portfolio credit risk management credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower s credit cycle 
statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including product pricing  risk appetite  setting credit limits  operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns 
in addition  credit decisions are statistically based with tolerances set to decrease the percentage of approvals as the risk profile increases 
statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and or internal historical experience 
these models are a critical component of our consumer credit risk management process and are used in the determination of both new and existing credit decisions  portfolio management strategies including authorizations and line management  collection practices and strategies  determination of the allowance for credit losses  and economic capital allocations for credit risk 
for information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies  nonperforming status and charge offs for the consumer portfolio  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
management of consumer credit risk concentrations consumer credit risk exposure is managed geographically and through our various product offerings with a goal that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in undesirable levels of risk 
we purchase credit protection on certain portions of our portfolio that is designed to enhance our overall risk management strategy 
at december  and  we had mitigated a portion of our credit risk on approximately billion and billion of consumer loans  including both residential mortgage and indirect automotive loans  through the purchase of credit protection

see below for a discussion of the impact of sop on the mbna portfolio 
sop sop addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor s initial investment in loans acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
sop requires impaired loans be recorded at fair value and prohibits carrying over or the creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting of loans acquired in a transfer that are within the scope of this sop categories of loans for which it is probable  at the time of acquisition  that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected 
the prohibition of the valuation allowance carryover applies to the purchase of an individual loan  a pool of loans  a group of loans  and loans acquired in a purchase business combination 
in accordance with sop  certain acquired loans of mbna that were considered impaired were written down to fair value at the acquisition date 
therefore  reported net charge offs and managed net losses were lower since these impaired loans that would have been charged off during the period were reduced to fair value as of the acquisition date 
sop does not apply to the acquired loans that have been securitized as they are not held on the corporation s balance sheet

as part of the overall credit risk assessment of a borrower or counterparty  most of our commercial credit exposure or transactions are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards 
subsequent to loan origination  risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis 
if necessary  risk ratings are adjusted to reflect changes in the financial condition  cash flow or financial situation of a borrower or counterparty 
we use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios 
risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of assigned economic capital and the allowance for credit 
table of contents losses 
in making credit decisions  we consider risk rating  collateral  country  industry and single name concentration limits while also balancing the total borrower or counterparty relationship and sva 
our lines of business and risk management personnel use a variety of tools to continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform under its obligations 
for information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies  nonperforming status and charge offs for the commercial portfolio  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
management of commercial credit risk concentrations portfolio credit risk is evaluated and managed with a goal that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in undesirable levels of risk 
we review  measure  and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry  product  geography and customer relationship 
distribution of loans and leases by loan size is an additional measure of the portfolio risk diversification 
we also review  measure  and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type 
in addition  within our international portfolio  we evaluate borrowings by region and by country 
tables and and tables through summarize these concentrations 
additionally  we utilize syndication of exposure to third parties  loan sales and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the loan portfolio 
from the perspective of portfolio risk management  customer concentration management is most relevant in global corporate and investment banking 
within that segment s business lending and capital markets and advisory services businesses  we facilitate bridge financing to fund acquisitions and other short term needs as well as provide syndicated financing for our clients 
these concentrations are managed in part through our established originate to distribute strategy 
these client transactions are sometimes large and leveraged 
they can also have a higher degree of risk as we are providing offers or commitments for various components of the clients capital structures  including lower rated unsecured and subordinated debt tranches 
in many cases  these offers to finance will not be accepted 
if accepted  these highly conditioned commitments are often retired prior to or shortly following funding via the placement of securities  syndication or the client s decision to terminate 
where we have a binding commitment and there is a market disruption or other unexpected event  there may be heightened exposure in the portfolios  an increase in criticized assets and higher potential for loss  unless an orderly disposition of the exposure can be made 
in global corporate and investment banking  concentrations are actively managed through the underwriting and ongoing monitoring processes  the originate to distribute strategy and through the utilization of various risk mitigation tools  such as credit derivatives  to economically hedge our risk to certain credit counterparties 
credit derivatives are financial instruments that we purchase for protection against the deterioration of credit quality 
earnings volatility increases due to accounting asymmetry as we mark to market the credit derivatives  as required by sfas  whereas the exposures being hedged  including the funding commitments  are accounted for on an accrual basis 
once funded  these exposures are accounted for at historical cost less an allowance for credit losses or  if held for sale  at the lower of cost or market

latin america accounted for billion  or seven percent of total foreign exposure at december   a decline of billion  or percent  from december  the decline in exposure in latin america was primarily due to the sale of our brazilian operations  partially offset by the equity in banco ita received in exchange for the sale  and a decline in local country exposure in chile 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in cross border exposure in mexico

there were no other countries with available local liabilities funding local country exposure greater than million 
at december   percent of the emerging markets exposure was in asia pacific  compared to percent at december  asia pacific emerging markets exposure increased by billion 
growth was driven by higher cross border sovereign and corporate securities trading exposure  primarily in south korea  india and singapore  as well as higher other financing exposure in india 
our exposure in china was primarily related to our investment in ccb at both december  and 
table of contents in december  the corporation completed the sale of its asia commercial banking business to ccb 
our corporate banking and wholesale franchises are not impacted by this sale 
at december   percent of the emerging markets exposure was in latin america compared to percent at december  lower exposures in brazil and chile were partially offset by an increase in mexico 
the decline in brazil was related to the sale of our brazilian operations in september in exchange principally for equity in banco ita 
as of december   our investment in banco ita accounted for billion of exposure in brazil 
the decline in chile was due to higher local liabilities which reduced our local exposure 
in august  we announced a definitive agreement to sell our operations in chile and uruguay for equity in banco ita 
these transactions are expected to close in early subsequent to the sale of our brazilian operations and the closing of the chile and uruguay transactions  the corporation will hold approximately seven percent of the equity of banco ita through voting and non voting shares 
the increased exposures in mexico were attributable to higher cross border corporate securities trading exposure 
our percent investment in santander accounted for billion and billion of exposure in mexico at december  and in december  we announced a definitive agreement with a consortium led by johannesburg based standard bank group limited for the sale of our assets and the assumption of our liabilities in argentina 
this transaction is expected to close in early provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses was billion  a million  or percent  increase over the consumer portion of the provision for credit losses increased million to billion compared to this increase was primarily driven by the addition of mbna  partially offset by lower bankruptcy related costs on the domestic consumer credit card portfolio 
on the domestic consumer credit card portfolio  lower bankruptcy charge offs resulting from bankruptcy reform and the absence of the million provision recorded in to establish reserves for changes in credit card minimum payment requirements were partially offset by portfolio seasoning 
consumer provision expense increased throughout the year as most products trended toward more normalized credit cost levels due to portfolio seasoning and an upward trend in bankruptcy related charge offs from the unusually low levels experienced post bankruptcy reform 
credit costs in europe increased throughout the year due to seasoning of the credit card portfolio and higher personal insolvencies in the united kingdom 
for discussions of the impact of sop  see consumer portfolio credit risk management beginning on page the commercial portion of the provision for credit losses for was million compared to negative million in the increase was driven by the absence in in global corporate and investment banking of benefits from the release of reserves in related to an improved risk profile in latin america and reduced uncertainties associated with the fleetboston credit integration 
also contributing to the increase were both the addition of mbna and seasoning of the business card and small business portfolios in global consumer and small business banking  as well as lower recoveries in in global corporate and investment banking 
partially offsetting these increases were reductions in global corporate and investment banking commercial reserves in as a stable economic environment throughout drove sustained favorable commercial credit market conditions

table of contents allowance for credit losses allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses is allocated based on two components 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the combined total of these two components 
the first component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers those commercial loans that are either nonperforming or impaired 
an allowance is allocated when the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price are lower than the carrying value of that loan 
for purposes of computing the specific loss component of the allowance  larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical loss experience for the respective product type and risk rating of the loans 
the second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers performing commercial loans and leases  and consumer loans 
the allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is established by product type after analyzing historical loss experience by internal risk rating  current economic conditions  industry performance trends  geographic or obligor concentrations within each portfolio segment  and any other pertinent information 
the commercial historical loss experience is updated quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflective of the current economic environment 
as of december   quarterly updating of historical loss experience did not have a material impact on the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the allowance for consumer and certain homogeneous commercial loan and lease products is based on aggregated portfolio segment evaluations  generally by product type 
loss forecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors including  but not limited to  historical loss experience  estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends  delinquencies  economic trends and credit scores 
these loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis in order to incorporate information reflective of the current economic environment 
as of december   quarterly updating of the loss forecast models increased the allowance for loan and lease losses due to portfolio seasoning and the trend toward more normalized loss levels 
included within this second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses and determined separately from the procedures outlined above are reserves which are maintained to cover uncertainties that affect our estimate of probable losses including the imprecision inherent in the forecasting methodologies  as well as domestic and global economic uncertainty  large single name defaults and event risk 
during  commercial reserves were released as a stable economic environment throughout drove sustained favorable commercial credit market conditions 
we monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred loan and lease losses 
this monitoring process includes periodic assessments by senior management of loan and lease portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those portfolios 
additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses are made by charges to the provision for credit losses 
credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses 
recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio as presented in table was billion at december   an increase of billion from december  this increase was primarily attributable to the addition of mbna 
the allowance for commercial loan and lease losses was billion at december   a million decrease from december  commercial foreign allowance levels decreased due to the sale of our brazilian operations 
the increase in commercial domestic allowance levels was primarily attributable to the addition of mbna partially offset by the above mentioned reductions in commercial reserves in within the individual consumer and commercial product categories  credit card domestic allowance levels include reductions throughout from new securitizations and reductions as reserves established in for changes in minimum payment requirements were utilized to absorb associated net charge offs 
direct indirect consumer allowance levels increased as the corporation discontinued new sales of receivables into the card services unsecured lending securitization trusts 
commercial domestic allowance levels also increased as reserves were established for new advances on business card accounts for which previous loan balances were sold to the securitization trusts 

table of contents reserve for unfunded lending commitments in addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses  we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments  such as letters of credit and financial guarantees  and binding unfunded loan commitments 
unfunded lending commitments are subject to individual reviews and are analyzed and segregated by risk according to our internal risk rating scale 
these risk classifications  in conjunction with an analysis of historical loss experience  utilization assumptions  current economic conditions and performance trends within specific portfolio segments  and any other pertinent information result in the estimation of the reserve for unfunded lending commitments 
the reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
we monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred credit losses upon draws of the commitments 
this monitoring process includes periodic assessments by senior management of credit portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those portfolios 
changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments are made through the provision for credit losses 
the reserve for unfunded lending commitments at december  was million  relatively flat with december

this risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and or activities including loans  deposits  securities  short term borrowings  long term debt  trading account assets and liabilities  and derivatives 
market sensitive assets and liabilities are generated through loans and deposits associated with our traditional banking business  customer and proprietary trading operations  alm process  credit risk mitigation activities and mortgage banking activities 
our traditional banking loan and deposit products are nontrading positions and are reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities historical cost 
the accounting rules require a historical cost view of traditional banking assets and liabilities 
however  these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions  primarily changes in the levels of interest rates 
the risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our nontrading positions is managed through our alm activities 
trading positions are reported at estimated market value with changes reflected in income 
trading positions are subject to various risk factors  which include exposures to interest rates and foreign exchange rates  as well as equity  mortgage  commodity and issuer risk factors 
we seek to mitigate these risk exposures by using techniques that encompass a variety of financial instruments in both the cash and derivatives markets 
the following discusses the key risk components along with respective risk mitigation techniques 
interest rate risk interest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates 
these instruments include  but are not limited to  loans  debt securities  certain trading related assets and liabilities  deposits  borrowings and derivative instruments 
hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks include related derivatives such as options  futures  forwards and swaps 

table of contents foreign exchange risk foreign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies 
the types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in foreign subsidiaries  foreign currency denominated loans  foreign currency denominated securities  future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions  foreign currency denominated debt and various foreign exchange derivative instruments whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or foreign interest rates 
hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options  currency swaps  futures  forwards and deposits 
mortgage risk mortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the value of mortgage related instruments 
the values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates  mortgage rates  default  other interest rates and interest rate volatility 
our exposure to these instruments takes several forms 
first  we trade and engage in market making activities in a variety of mortgage securities including whole loans  pass through certificates  commercial mortgages  and collateralized mortgage obligations 
second  we originate a variety of mortgage backed securities which involves the accumulation of mortgage related loans in anticipation of eventual securitization 
third  we may hold positions in mortgage securities and residential mortgage loans as part of the alm portfolio 
fourth  we create msrs as part of our mortgage activities 
see notes and of the consolidated financial statements for additional information on msrs 
hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options  futures  forwards  swaps  swaptions and securities 
equity market risk equity market risk represents exposures to securities that represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of domestic and foreign common stock or other equity linked instruments 
instruments that would lead to this exposure include  but are not limited to  the following common stock  exchange traded funds  american depositary receipts adrs  convertible bonds  listed equity options puts and calls  over the counter equity options  equity total return swaps  equity index futures and other equity derivative products 
hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options  futures  swaps  convertible bonds and cash positions 
commodity risk commodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the petroleum  natural gas  power  and metals markets 
these instruments consist primarily of futures  forwards  swaps and options 
hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options  futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity product  as well as cash positions 
issuer credit risk issuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers 
our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of credit spreads  by credit migration  or by defaults 
hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds  credit default swaps and other credit fixed income instruments 
trading risk management trading related revenues represent the amount earned from trading positions which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets 
trading account assets and liabilities and derivative positions are reported at fair value 
for more information on fair value  see complex accounting estimates beginning on page trading account profits represent the net amount earned from our trading positions and  as reported in the consolidated statement of income  do not 
table of contents include the net interest income recognized on trading positions  or the related funding charge or benefit 
trading account profits can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand 
trading account profits are dependent on the volume and type of transactions  the level of risk assumed  and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever changing market environment 
the histogram of daily revenue or loss below is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading related revenue for trading related revenue encompasses proprietary trading and customer related activities 
during  positive trading related revenue was recorded for percent of the trading days 
furthermore  there were no trading days with losses greater than million and the largest loss was million 
this can be compared to  where positive trading related revenue was recorded for percent of the trading days and only four percent of the total trading days had losses greater than million and the largest loss was million 
logo to evaluate risk in our trading activities  we focus on the actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios 
at a portfolio and corporate level  we use var modeling and stress testing 
var is a key statistic used to measure market risk 
in order to manage day to day risks  var is subject to trading limits both for our overall trading portfolio and within individual businesses 
senior management reviews and evaluates the results of these limit excesses 
a var model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses 
the var represents the worst loss the portfolio is expected to experience with a given level of confidence 
var depends on the volatility of the positions in the portfolio and on how strongly their risks are correlated 
within any var model  there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company 
our var model uses a historical simulation approach based on three years of historical data and assumes a percent confidence level 
statistically  this means that losses will exceed var  on average  one out of trading days  or two to three times each year 
actual losses did not exceed var in and exceeded var twice in the assumptions and data underlying our var model are updated on a regular basis 
in addition  the predictive accuracy of the model is periodically tested by comparing actual losses for individual businesses with the losses predicted by the var model 
senior management reviews and evaluates the results of these tests 

table of contents the following graph shows daily trading related revenue and var for logo table presents average  high and low daily var for the twelve months ended december  and table trading activities market risk twelve months ended december var var dollars in millions average high low average high low foreign exchange interest rate credit real estate mortgage equities commodities portfolio diversification total market based trading portfolio the high and low for the total portfolio may not equal the sum of the individual components as the highs or lows of the individual portfolios may have occurred on different trading days 
see commercial portfolio credit risk management on page for a discussion of the var related to the credit derivatives that economically hedge the loan portfolio 
stress testing because the very nature of a var model suggests results can exceed our estimates  we also stress test our portfolio 
stress testing estimates the value change in our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements 
various types of stress tests are run regularly against the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses 
historical scenarios simulate the impact of price changes which occurred during a set of extended historical market events 
the results of these scenarios are reported daily to senior management 
during  the largest losses among these scenarios ranged from million to million 
hypothetical scenarios evaluate the potential impact of extreme but plausible events 
these scenarios are developed to address perceived vulnerabilities in the market and in our portfolios  and are periodically updated 

table of contents senior management reviews and evaluates results of these scenarios monthly 
during  the largest losses among these scenarios ranged from million to million 
worst case losses  which represent the most extreme losses in our daily var calculation  are reported daily 
finally  desk level stress tests are performed daily for individual businesses 
these stress tests evaluate the potential adverse impact of large moves in the market risk factors to which those businesses are most sensitive 
interest rate risk management for nontrading activities interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our nontrading exposures 
our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not adversely affect core net interest income managed basis 
interest rate risk is measured as the potential volatility in our core net interest income managed basis caused by changes in market interest rates 
client facing activities  primarily lending and deposit taking  create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet 
interest rate risk from these activities  as well as the impact of changing market conditions  is managed through our alm activities 
simulations are used to estimate the impact on core net interest income managed basis using numerous interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
these simulations evaluate how the above mentioned scenarios impact core net interest income managed basis on short term financial instruments  debt securities  loans  deposits  borrowings and derivative instruments 
in addition  these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics such as loan and deposit growth and pricing  changes in funding mix  and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics 
the balance sheet management group analyzes core net interest income managed basis forecasts utilizing different rate scenarios  with the base case utilizing forward interest rates 
the balance sheet management group frequently updates the core net interest income managed basis forecast for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends and market conditions 
thus  we continually monitor our balance sheet position in an effort to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes 
we prepare forward looking forecasts of core net interest income managed basis 
these baseline forecasts take into consideration expected future business growth  alm positioning  and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by forward interest rates 
we then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have to these baseline forecasts in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions 
the spot and month forward monthly average rates used in our respective baseline forecasts at december  and were as follows table forward rates december federal funds ten year swap federal funds ten year swap spot rates month forward average rates the following table reflects the pre tax dollar impact to forecasted core net interest income managed basis over the next twelve months from december  and  resulting from a bp gradual parallel increase  a bp gradual parallel decrease  a bp gradual curve flattening increase in short term rates or decrease in long term rates and a bp gradual curve steepening decrease in short term rates or increase in long term rates from the forward market curve

table of contents table estimated core net interest income managed basis at risk dollars in millions december curve change short rate long rate parallel shift parallel shift flatteners short end long end steepeners short end long end the sensitivity analysis above assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shifts over the indicated years 
the estimated exposure is reported on a managed basis and reflects impacts that may be realized primarily in net interest income and card income 
this sensitivity analysis excludes any impact that could occur in the valuation of retained interests in the corporation s securitizations due to changes in interest rate levels 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information on securitizations 
beyond what is already implied in the forward market curve  the interest rate risk position has become modestly more exposed to rising rates since december  this exposure is primarily driven by the addition of mbna 
conversely  over a month horizon  we would benefit from falling rates or a steepening of the yield curve beyond what is already implied in the forward market curve 
as part of our alm activities  we use securities  residential mortgages  and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity 
securities the securities portfolio is an integral part of our alm position 
during the third quarter of  we made a strategic shift in our balance sheet composition strategy to reduce the level of mortgage backed securities and thereby reduce the level of investments in debt securities relative to loans 
accordingly  management targeted a reduction of mortgage backed debt securities of approximately billion over the next couple of years in order to achieve a balance sheet composition that would be consistent with management s revised risk reward profile 
management expects the total targeted reduction will result from the third quarter sale of billion in mortgage backed securities combined with expected maturities and paydowns of mortgage backed securities over the next couple of years 
for those securities that are in an unrealized loss position we have the intent and ability to hold these securities to recovery 
the securities portfolio also includes investments to a lesser extent in corporate  municipal and other investment grade debt securities 
the strategic shift in the balance sheet composition strategy did not impact these holdings 
for those securities that are in an unrealized loss position we have the intent and ability to hold these securities to recovery 
during and  we purchased afs debt securities of billion and billion  sold billion and billion  and had maturities and received paydowns of billion and billion 
we realized million and billion in gains losses on sales of debt securities during and the value of our accumulated oci related to afs debt securities increased improved by million pre tax during which was driven by the realized loss on the securities sale partially offset by an increase in interest rates 
accumulated oci includes billion in after tax losses at december   related to after tax unrealized losses associated with our afs securities portfolio  including billion of after tax unrealized losses related to afs debt securities and million of after tax unrealized gains related to afs equity securities 
total market value of the afs debt securities was billion at december   with a weighted average duration of years and primarily relates to our mortgage backed securities portfolio 

table of contents changes to the accumulated oci amounts for the afs securities portfolio going forward will be driven by further interest rate or price fluctuations  the collection of cash flows including prepayment and maturity activity  and the passage of time 
residential mortgage portfolio during and  we purchased billion and billion of residential mortgages related to alm activities and sold billion and billion 
we added billion and billion of originated residential mortgages to the balance sheet for and additionally  we received paydowns of billion and billion for and the ending balance at december  was billion  compared to billion at december  interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our alm activities and serve as an efficient tool to mitigate our interest rate and foreign exchange risk 
we use derivatives to hedge the changes in cash flows or changes in market values on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our hedging activities 
our interest rate contracts are generally non leveraged generic interest rate and foreign exchange basis swaps  options  futures and forwards 
in addition  we use foreign exchange contracts  including cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts  to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  as well as certain equity investments in foreign subsidiaries 
table reflects the notional amounts  fair value  weighted average receive fixed and pay fixed rates  expected maturity  and estimated duration of our open alm derivatives at december  and the changes in our derivatives portfolio reflect actions taken for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk management 
the decisions to reposition our derivative portfolio are based upon the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate environment  balance sheet composition and trends  and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions 
the notional amount of our net receive fixed swap position including foreign exchange contracts decreased billion to billion at december  compared to billion at december  the decrease in the net receive fixed position is primarily due to terminations and maturities within the portfolio during the year 
the notional amount of our foreign exchange basis swaps increased billion to billion at december  compared to billion at december  the notional amount of our option position increased billion to billion at december   compared to december  the increase in the notional amount of options was due to the addition of caps used to reduce the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
futures and forward rate contracts are comprised primarily of billion of forward purchase contracts of mortgage loans at december  and billion of forward purchase contracts of mortgage backed securities and mortgage loans at december  the forward purchase contracts outstanding at december   settled in january with an average yield of percent 
the forward purchase contracts outstanding at december   settled from january to april  with an average yield of percent 
the following table includes derivatives utilized in our alm activities  including those designated as sfas accounting hedges and those used as economic hedges 
the fair value of net alm contracts increased from a loss of million at december  to a gain of billion at december  the increase was primarily attributable to gains from changes in the value of foreign exchange basis swaps of billion and receive fixed and pay fixed interest rate swaps of billion  partially offset by losses from changes in the values of foreign exchange contracts of billion  and option products of billion 
the increase in the value of foreign exchange basis swaps was due to the strengthening of most foreign currencies against the dollar during the increases in the value of receive fixed interest rate swaps was due to terminations partially offset by losses as a result of increases in market interest rates 
the increase in the value of pay fixed interest rate swaps was due to gains from increases in market interest rates partially offset by terminations 
the decrease in the value of foreign exchange contracts was due primarily to increases in foreign interest rates during the decrease in the value of option products was primarily due to changes in the composition of the option portfolio

mortgage banking risk management interest rate lock commitments irlcs on loans intended to be sold are subject to interest rate risk between the date of the irlc and the date the loan is funded 
residential first mortgage loans held for sale are subject to interest rate risk from the date of funding until the loans are sold to the secondary market 
to hedge interest rate risk  we utilize forward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments including purchased options 
these instruments are used either as an economic hedge of irlcs and residential first mortgage loans held for sale  or designated as a cash flow hedge of residential first mortgage loans held for sale  in which case their net of tax unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated oci

at december   the amount of msrs identified as being hedged by derivatives was approximately billion 
the notional amount of the derivative contracts designated as economic hedges of msrs at december  was billion 
the changes in the fair values of the derivative contracts are substantially offset by changes in the values of the msrs that are hedged by these derivative contracts 
during  the increase in value attributed to economically hedged msrs was million offset by derivative hedge losses of million

operational risk management operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  including system conversions and integration  and external events 
successful operational risk management is particularly important to diversified financial services companies because of the nature  volume and complexity of the financial services business 
we approach operational risk from two perspectives enterprise wide and line of business specific 
the compliance and operational risk committee provides oversight of significant company wide operational and compliance issues 
within global risk management  enterprise compliance and operational risk management develops policies  practices  controls and monitoring tools for assessing and managing operational risks across the corporation 
we also mitigate operational risk through a broad based approach to process management and process improvement 
improvement efforts are focused on reduction of variation in outputs 
we have a dedicated quality and productivity team to manage and certify the process management and improvement efforts 
for selected risks  we use specialized support groups  such as information security 
table of contents and supply chain management  to develop corporate wide risk management practices  such as an information security program and a supplier program to ensure that suppliers adopt appropriate policies and procedures when performing work on behalf of the corporation 
these specialized groups also assist the lines of business in the development and implementation of risk management practices specific to the needs of the individual businesses 
these groups also work with line of business executives and risk executives to develop appropriate policies  practices  controls and monitoring tools for each line of business 
through training and communication efforts  compliance and operational risk awareness is driven across the corporation 
the lines of business are responsible for all the risks within the business line  including operational risks 
operational and compliance risk executives  working in conjunction with senior line of business executives  have developed key tools to help manage  monitor and report operational risk in each business line 
examples of these include personnel management practices  data reconciliation processes  fraud management units  transaction processing monitoring and analysis  business recovery planning  and new product introduction processes 
in addition  the lines of business are responsible for monitoring adherence to corporate practices 
management uses a self assessment process  which helps to identify and evaluate the status of risk issues  including mitigation plans  as appropriate 
the goal of the self assessment process is to periodically assess changing market and business conditions and to evaluate key operational risks impacting each line of business 
in addition to information gathered from the self assessment process  key operational risk indicators have been developed and are used to help identify trends and issues on both a corporate and a business line level 
recent accounting and reporting developments see note of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued or proposed accounting pronouncements 
complex accounting estimates our significant accounting principles  as described in note of the consolidated financial statements  are essential in understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate values of assets and liabilities 
we have procedures and processes to facilitate making these judgments 
the more judgmental estimates are summarized below 
we have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation process that  with the exception of accrued taxes  involve mathematical models to derive the estimates 
in many cases  there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the model 
where alternatives exist  we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs 
actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could impact net income 
separate from the possible future impact to net income from input and model variables  the value of our lending portfolio and market sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet measurement  often significantly  due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions 
such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant  negative effect on future operating results 
these fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is our estimate of probable losses in the loans and leases portfolio and within our unfunded lending commitments 
changes to the allowance for credit losses are reported in the consolidated statement of income in the provision for credit losses 
our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in the credit risk management section beginning on page and note of the consolidated financial statements 
due to the variability in the drivers of the assumptions made in this process  estimates of the portfolio s inherent risks and overall collectibility change with changes in the economy  individual industries  countries and individual borrowers or counterparties ability and willingness to repay their obligations 
the degree to which any particular assumption affects the allowance for credit losses depends on the severity of the change and its relationship to the other assumptions 

table of contents key judgments used in determining the allowance for credit losses include i risk ratings for pools of commercial loans and leases  ii market and collateral values and discount rates for individually evaluated loans  iii product type classifications for consumer and commercial loans and leases  iv loss rates used for consumer and commercial loans and leases  v adjustments made to assess current events and conditions  vi considerations regarding domestic and global economic uncertainty  and vii overall credit conditions 
our allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the risk rating assigned to commercial loans and leases 
assuming a downgrade of one level in the internal risk rating for commercial loans and leases rated under the internal risk rating scale  except loans and leases already risk rated doubtful as defined by regulatory authorities  the allowance for loan and lease losses would increase by approximately million at december  the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loan and lease outstandings at december  was percent and this hypothetical increase in the allowance would raise the ratio to approximately percent 
our allowance for loan and lease losses is also sensitive to the loss rates used for the consumer and commercial portfolios 
a percent increase in the loss rates used on the consumer and commercial loan and lease portfolios would increase the allowance for loan and lease losses at december  by approximately million  of which million would relate to consumer and million to commercial 
these sensitivity analyses do not represent management s expectations of the deterioration in risk ratings or the increases in loss rates but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for loan and lease losses to changes in key inputs 
we believe the risk ratings and loss severities currently in use are appropriate and that the probability of a downgrade of one level of the internal risk ratings for commercial loans and leases within a short period of time is remote 
the process of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses requires a high degree of judgment 
it is possible that others  given the same information  may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions 
fair value of financial instruments trading account assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value  which is primarily based on actively traded markets where prices are based on either direct market quotes or observed transactions 
liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the fair value of trading account assets or liabilities 
market price quotes may not be readily available for some positions  or positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased 
situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by the market s perception of credit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector 
in these instances  fair value is determined based on limited available market information and other factors  principally from reviewing the issuer s financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies 
at december   billion  or six percent  of trading account assets were fair valued using these alternative approaches 
an immaterial amount of trading account liabilities were fair valued using these alternative approaches at december  the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity  counterparty credit quality  future servicing costs and other deal specific factors  where appropriate 
to ensure the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities  various processes and controls have been adopted  which include a model validation policy that requires a review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing  financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification  a trading product valuation policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations  and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products 
these processes and controls are performed independently of the business segments 
the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the over the counter market are determined using quantitative models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates  prices  and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors  which are used to value the position 
the predominance of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources  including brokers  market transactions and third party pricing services 
estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions that are either option based or have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are less readily available or are unobservable  in which case quantitative based extrapolations of rate  price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values 
at december   
table of contents the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities determined by these quantitative models were billion and billion 
these amounts reflect the full fair value of the derivatives and do not isolate the discrete value associated with the subjective valuation variable 
further  they represent percent and percent of derivative assets and liabilities  before the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements 
for the year ended december   there were no changes to the quantitative models  or uses of such models  that resulted in a material adjustment to the consolidated statement of income 
trading account profits  which represent the net amount earned from our trading positions  can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand 
trading account profits are dependent on the volume and type of transactions  the level of risk assumed  and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever changing market environment 
to evaluate risk in our trading activities  we focus on the actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios 
at a portfolio and corporate level  we use trading limits  stress testing and tools such as var modeling  which estimates a potential daily loss which is not expected to be exceeded with a specified confidence level  to measure and manage market risk 
at december   the amount of our var was million based on a percent confidence level 
for more information on var  see trading risk management beginning on page the corporation recognizes gains and losses at inception of a derivative contract only if the fair value of the contract is evidenced by a quoted market price in an active market  an observable price or other market transaction  or other observable data supporting a valuation model in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities eitf 
for those gains and losses not evidenced by the above mentioned market data  the transaction price is used as the fair value of the derivative contract 
any difference between the transaction price and the model fair value is considered an unrecognized gain or loss at inception of the contract 
these unrecognized gains and losses are recorded in income using the straight line method of amortization over the contractual life of the derivative contract 
earlier recognition of the full unrecognized gain or loss is permitted if the trade is terminated early  subsequent market activity is observed which supports the model fair value of the contract  or significant inputs used in the valuation model become observable in the market 
as of december   the balance of the above unrecognized gains and losses was not material 
sfas no 
 fair value measurements which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements  will nullify certain guidance in eitf when adopted and as a result  a portion of the above unrecognized gains and losses will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
afs securities are recorded at fair value  which is generally based on direct market quotes from actively traded markets 
principal investing principal investing is included within equity investments included in all other and is discussed in more detail beginning on page principal investing is comprised of a diversified portfolio of investments in privately held and publicly traded companies at all stages of their life cycle  from start up to buyout 
these investments are made either directly in a company or held through a fund 
some of these companies may need access to additional cash to support their long term business models 
market conditions and company performance may impact whether funding is available from private investors or the capital markets 
investments with active market quotes are carried at estimated fair value  however  the majority of our investments do not have publicly available price quotations 
at december   we had nonpublic investments of billion  or approximately percent of the total portfolio 
valuation of these investments requires significant management judgment 
management determines values of the underlying investments based on multiple methodologies including in depth semi annual reviews of the investee s financial statements and financial condition  discounted cash flows  the prospects of the investee s industry and current overall market conditions for similar investments 
in addition  on a quarterly basis as events occur or information comes to the attention of management that indicates a change in the value of an investment is warranted  investments are adjusted from their original invested amount to estimated fair values at the balance sheet date with changes being recorded in equity investment gains in the consolidated statement of income 
investments are not adjusted above the original amount invested unless there is clear evidence of a fair value in excess of the original invested 
table of contents amount 
as part of the valuation process  senior management reviews the portfolio and determines when an impairment needs to be recorded 
the principal investing portfolio is not material to our consolidated balance sheet  but the impact of the valuation adjustments may be material to our operating results for any particular quarter 
accrued income taxes as more fully described in notes and of the consolidated financial statements  we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
accrued income taxes  reported as a component of accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  represents the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date 
we currently file income tax returns in more than jurisdictions and consider many factors including statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction 
in applying the principles of sfas  we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities 
these revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes  which also may result from our own income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies  may be material to our operating results for any given quarter 
goodwill and intangibles assets the nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets is discussed in detail in notes and of the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis  or in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
the reporting units utilized for this test were those that are one level below the business segments identified on page the impairment test is performed in two steps 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  however  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step must be performed 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  as defined in sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
for intangible assets subject to amortization  impairment exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
an impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from it 
an intangible asset subject to amortization shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as a significant or adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of the intangible asset  indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded to the extent the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
the fair values of the reporting units were determined using a combination of valuation techniques consistent with the income approach and the market approach and the fair values of the intangible assets were determined using the income approach 
for purposes of the income approach  discounted cash flows were calculated by taking the net present value of estimated cash flows using a combination of historical results  estimated future cash flows and an appropriate price to earnings multiple 
we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and actual results may differ from forecasted results 
however  these differences have not been material and we believe that this methodology provides a reasonable means to determine fair values 
cash flows were discounted using a discount rate based on expected equity return rates  which was percent for expected rates of equity returns were estimated based on historical market returns and risk return rates for similar industries of the reporting unit 
for purposes of the market approach  valuations of reporting units were based on actual comparable market transactions and market earnings multiples for similar industries of the reporting unit 
our evaluations for the year ended december  indicated there was no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets

net interest income net interest income on a fte basis increased billion to billion in compared to the primary drivers of the increase were the impact of fleetboston  organic growth in consumer primarily credit card and home equity and commercial loans  higher domestic deposit levels and a larger alm portfolio primarily securities 
partially offsetting these increases was the adverse impact of spread compression due to the flattening of the yield curve  which contributed to lower net interest income 
the net interest yield on a fte basis declined bps to percent in  primarily due to the adverse impact of an increase in lower yielding  trading related balances and spread compression  which was partially offset by growth in core deposit and consumer loans 
noninterest income noninterest income increased billion to billion in  due primarily to increases in card income of billion  equity investment gains of billion  trading account profits of million  service charges of million  investment and brokerage services of million and mortgage banking income of million 
card income increased due to increased interchange income and merchant discount fees driven by growth in debit and credit purchase volumes and the acquisition of national processing  inc npc 
equity investment gains increased as liquidity in the private equity markets increased 
trading account profits increased due to increased customer activity and the absence of a writedown of the excess spread certificates that occurred in service charges grew driven by organic account growth 
investment and brokerage services increased due to higher asset management fees and mutual fund fees 
mortgage banking income grew due to lower msr impairment charges  partially offset by lower production income 
offsetting these increases was lower other income of million primarily related to losses on derivative instruments designated as economic hedges in alm activities that did not qualify for sfas hedge accounting treatment 
provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses increased billion to billion in domestic consumer credit card drove the increase  the result of higher bankruptcy related credit costs resulting from bankruptcy reform  portfolio seasoning  the impact of the fleetboston portfolio and new advances on accounts for which previous loan balances were sold to the securitization trusts 
the provision also increased as the rate of credit quality improvement slowed in the commercial portfolio and a reserve was established for estimated losses associated with hurricane katrina 
partially offsetting these increases were reductions in the reserves due to an improved risk profile in latin america as well as reduced uncertainties associated with the fleetboston credit integration 

table of contents gains on sales of debt securities gains on sales of debt securities in and  were billion and billion 
the decrease was primarily due to lower gains realized on mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds

income tax expense income tax expense was billion in compared to billion in  resulting in an effective tax rate of percent in and percent in the difference in the effective tax rate between years resulted primarily from a tax benefit of million related to the special one time deduction associated with the repatriation of certain foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of business segment operations global consumer and small business banking net income increased billion  or percent  to billion in compared to total revenue rose billion  or percent  in compared to  driven by increases in net interest income and noninterest income 
growth in average deposits and average loans and leases contributed to the billion  or seven percent  increase in net interest income 
increases in card income of billion  service charges of million and mortgage banking income of million drove the billion  or percent  increase in noninterest income 
these increases were offset by increases in the provision for credit losses and noninterest expense 
the provision for credit losses increased million to billion in mainly due to higher credit card net charge offs driven by an increase in bankruptcy related net charge offs 
in addition  the provision was impacted by new advances on accounts for which previous loan balances were sold to the securitization trusts 
noninterest expense increased million  or five percent  primarily due to the impact of fleetboston and npc 
global corporate and investment banking net income increased million  or eight percent  to billion in compared to total revenue increased billion  or percent  in compared to  driven by increases in net interest income and noninterest income 
net interest income rose million  or five percent  due to growth in average loans and leases and average deposits  wider spreads on the deposit portfolio due to higher short term interest rates  and the impact of fleetboston earning assets offset by spread compression and a flattening yield curve in noninterest income increased billion  or percent  resulting from higher other noninterest income  trading account profits and investment and brokerage services 
net income was also impacted by higher gains on sales of debt securities 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense and a reduced benefit from provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses increased million to negative million in the negative provision reflected continued improvement in commercial credit quality although at a slower pace than experienced in an improved risk profile in latin america and reduced uncertainties resulting from the completion of credit related integration activities for fleetboston also contributed to the negative provision 
noninterest expense increased by million  or eight percent  driven by higher performance based incentive compensation  processing costs and the impact of fleetboston  partially offset by nonrecurring charges recognized in for the segment s share of the mutual fund settlement and other litigation expenses 

table of contents global wealth and investment management net income increased million  or percent  to billion in compared to total revenue increased billion  or percent  in net interest income increased million  or percent  driven by the addition of the fleetboston portfolio and organic growth in deposits and loans in pb i and the private bank 
global wealth and investment management also benefited from the migration of deposits from global consumer and small business banking 
the total cumulative average impact of migrated balances was billion in compared to billion in noninterest income increased million  or percent  driven by increased investment and brokerage services revenue primarily due to the impact of fleetboston 
these increases were offset by higher noninterest expense 
noninterest expense increased million  or seven percent  related to higher personnel expense driven by pb i growth in the northeast and the impact of fleetboston  partially offset by nonrecurring charges recognized in for the segment s share of the mutual fund settlement and other litigation expenses 
all other net income increased million  or percent  to million in compared to in compared to  total revenue rose million to million  primarily driven by an increase in equity investment gains in offsetting this increase was a decline in the fair value of derivative instruments which were used as economic hedges of interest and foreign exchange rates as part of our alm activities 
provision for credit losses decreased million to million in  resulting from changes to components of the formula and other factors effective in  and reduced credit costs in associated with previously exited businesses 
these decreases were offset in part by the establishment of a million reserve for estimated losses associated with hurricane katrina 
gains on sales of debt securities decreased million to million primarily due to lower gains realized in on mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds than in merger and restructuring charges decreased million as the fleetboston integration was nearing completion and the infrastructure initiative was completed in the first quarter of income tax expense decreased million in  driven by an increase in tax benefits for low income housing credits
