item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business principally involves the development  manufacture  marketing and sale of proprietary cell based diagnostic and research products and certain service activities with a primary focus on cancer 
we believe that our products can provide significant clinical benefits by giving physicians better information to understand  treat  monitor and diagnose cancer and predict outcomes 
our technologies can identify  count and characterize a small number of circulating tumor cells  or ctcs  and other rare cells present in a blood sample from a patient 
we also employ our technologies to provide analytical services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to assist them in developing new therapeutic agents 
we were incorporated in august in the commonwealth of pennsylvania as immunicon corporation 
in december  we merged with and into immunicon corporation  a delaware corporation 
in march  we obtained million in financing from the sale of our convertible preferred stock 
as a result  we substantially increased investment in our cancer related products and technologies  hired additional key management team members and redirected our business strategy 
since  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to the development of our cell analysis platforms and diagnostic and research tools for applications in cancer 
in april  we completed an underwritten initial public offering  or ipo  of our common stock 
including the exercise of the underwriters overallotment option  we raised approximately million  net of fees and other expenses 
in june  we sold million shares of our common stock at per share and received million  net of fees and other expenses 
these shares were sold pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed in may in december  we entered into a definitive agreement for the sale and issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured subordinated convertible promissory notes  or notes  which are convertible initially into an aggregate of up to  shares of our common stock 
the notes bear interest at per annum 
interest is not payable currently but is accrued and added to the principal on a quarterly basis 
any portion of the notes and all accrued but unpaid interest which is not converted is repayable in cash on december  this agreement also includes warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the notes are convertible into shares at a conversion price of 
the warrants have an exercise price of per shares 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of the notes and warrants after deducting the placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses of million  million of which were paid as of december  the remainder was paid by the end of january see liquidity and capital resources for more information 
we expect to incur losses  which may continue over the next several years as we continue to commercialize our cancer diagnostic products 
table of contents part ii continue to develop and commercialize other products and services which use our technology for diseases other than cancer conduct clinical trials to expand the uses of our technologies in metastatic cancers including metastatic breast  colorectal and prostate cancer and to earlier stages of the disease in breast and other cancers as well as for other potential applications of our technologies other than cancer  incur costs to place our cell analysis systems with customers and to support other commercialization activities  and support our manufacturing efforts for instruments  bulk reagents  reagent kits and other consumable products 
we are highly dependent on our collaboration with veridex 
in addition  we expect to continue to generate substantial losses for at least the next two years 
we will likely need to obtain additional funding to support the activities described above 
each of our research and development programs is subject to risks and uncertainties  including the requirement to obtain regulatory approval  that are outside of our control 
as a result of these risks and uncertainties  we are unable to predict the period in which we will achieve profitability 
for example  we may experience slow adoption of our cancer diagnostic products or our applications for clearance and approval from the fda to market our products may be subject to delays or rejections for a variety of reasons 
moreover  the product candidates we are developing must overcome significant technological and marketing challenges before they can be successfully commercialized 
veridex collaboration we expect that the majority of our revenues from product sales for at least the years and will be derived from our relationship with veridex 
we have a development  license and supply agreement with veridex  which provides veridex with exclusive worldwide rights to commercialize cell analysis products based on our technologies in the field of cancer 
in march  we began commercialization of products that incorporate our technologies for research use only  or ruo  including third party shipments of the veridex cellsearch circulating tumor cell kit  the immunicon celltracks autoprep system  and immunicon cellspotter analyzer 
veridex received k clearance from the fda  in january for in vitro diagnostic  or ivd  use of the veridex cellsearch circulating tumor cell kit in the management of metastatic breast cancer breast cancer that has spread beyond the primary breast tumor 
commercialization of our products for ivd use began in october in june  we announced the release for sale of our new rare cell analysis platform  the celltracks analyzer ii 
this product is the next generation analyzer and we no longer sell the cellspotter analyzer although we still support the cellspotters which remain in the field 
veridex received fda clearance in october for expanded claims for the cellsearch ctc kit in metastatic breast cancer 
in december we received fda clearance to market our cellsearch kit as an aid in the monitoring of patients with metastatic breast cancer 
the claims state that serial testing for circulating tumor cell count should be used in conjunction with other clinical methods for monitoring breast cancer 
a ctc count of or more per ml of blood at any time during the course of the disease is predictive of shorter progression free survival and overall survival 
we are responsible for all cellular research and development  including the costs of clinical development 
upon any sale by veridex of these reagent based products and test kits  consumable products and disposable items  veridex is obligated to pay us approximately of their net sales less the cost previously reimbursed for these products 
we are responsible for the sale of instrument platforms such as our celltracks autoprep system and ctaii 
veridex acts as our sales agent for the sales of instrument 
table of contents part ii platforms and receives up to of the invoice price as a sales commission subject to a minimum gross profit margin  as defined in our agreement with veridex  received by us on each system of 
in and we determined to offer our systems at a price which was below our fully allocated cost in order to aid in the sale of systems into the market 
we believe that the long term value of our cancer products is with the reagent kit and other consumable products 
therefore we determined to offer the instrument systems at prices which would be considered more favorable to customers 
however  we are not likely to continue this practice in and beyond 
we are responsible for developing these cell analysis products and our cell analysis systems under the development plan 
we are also responsible for managing and administering all clinical trials under the development plan 
this plan is subject to the approval of a joint steering committee comprised of members designated by us and veridex 
veridex has the majority of votes on this committee  although the entire agreement is subject to arbitration provisions in the event of any disputes that may arise 
we must pay the first million in clinical trial costs for the first cell analysis product for general population screening for a major cancer  and veridex is responsible for the next million of such clinical trial costs 
we have agreed to negotiate in good faith for the allocation of costs in excess of million 
as of december   we have incurred no costs related to clinical trials for a product for general population screening and we do not anticipate spending any funds on clinical trials toward such a product through our agreement with veridex provides for a total of up to million in non refundable license and milestone payments related to research and development activities  including up to million for the initial license and up to million related to the completion of certain instrument and clinical trial milestones 
we have received million as of december  we have also continuously reviewed the status of the remaining development milestones and  where appropriate  have renegotiated the development requirement and payment terms 
we do not believe that these renegotiations will have a material adverse effect on the company s product development or financial position 
we expect to earn the remaining million in development milestone payments over the next three to five years 
if we do not successfully complete the payment criteria for a given future development milestone  we will not receive the applicable milestone payment 
if we do not successfully complete the payment criteria by the target date for a given milestone  we will continue to be entitled to receive the milestone payment in the future upon successful completion of the criteria 
however  veridex s obligation to pay us a percentage of the net sales for the specific cell analysis product to which the milestone relates would be reduced by for the ten year period beginning with the shipment for commercial sale of the first product resulting from this agreement 
in no event  however  would reductions due to missed target dates reduce our proportionate percentage share of net sales for the product specified that we would otherwise be entitled to receive from veridex for sales of all cell analysis products by veridex under this agreement by more than in the aggregate 
in the case of the cellsearch product related to metastatic breast cancer we agreed with veridex that we did not reach a certain development milestone within the time period specified and therefore we will receive approximately of net sales for this product 
in addition  if we achieve certain levels of sales of our reagents we may receive up to an additional million in milestone payments from veridex although we do not expect to receive any milestone payments related to sales goals until at least beginning with commercialization of the first ivd product under this agreement which occurred in october  we are required to invest in certain research and development activities an amount equal to at least of veridex s net sales  excluding revenues from instrument sales  from these products 
these research and development activities may consist of any activities  such as product improvements  product line extensions and clinical trials  conducted to achieve the milestones described below  to advance the development program designed by the steering committee for this agreement  or to enhance 
table of contents part ii the cancer related cell analysis products or sample preparation and cell analysis systems based on our technologies 
however  beginning with the first calendar year after the amount of these net sales exceeds million we are only required to invest an amount equal to at least of these net sales 
we believe that we exceeded our funding obligation under this section of the agreement for the year ended december  we believe that we have manufacturing capacity available at our existing facilities and under our existing agreements with component suppliers to satisfy commercial demand through  at least 
veridex is responsible for filling and packaging costs for the reagents  as well as sales  marketing  distribution  customer and technical support and field service of our cancer products  including instrumentation 
we have retained worldwide commercialization rights to all non cancer applications of our technologies 
the pace and outcome of both our commercialization efforts and clinical development programs are difficult to predict 
as a result  we anticipate that our quarterly results will fluctuate for the foreseeable future 
in view of this variability and of our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and you should not rely on them as indicative of our future performance 
dhi collaboration in december  we signed a definitive license  development  supply and distribution agreement to develop and commercialize products in the field of clinical virology diagnostics  starting with a panel of multiplex respiratory virus and sexually transmitted infection assays with dhi 
the agreement terms are in effect for a period ending on the fifth anniversary of the commencement of the commercial period and either party may elect to extend the original term for an additional five years 
we received an upfront non refundable license fee of  and are eligible for an additional million upon approval by the fda for the first initial product 
in addition  we will receive quarterly payments of  each beginning in january to assist us in developing an instrument system and reagents for this collaboration 
we will manufacture and supply dhi with their requirements for bulk reagents and dhi will manufacture and supply the detection reagents 
we will receive of the revenue from the sale of these reagents 
dhi will act as our distributor for the instrument systems 
dhi will be responsible for all expenses for sales and training with respect to products and systems 
revenues we initiated sales activities for instrument platforms and reagent kits for ruo in the first quarter of and for ivd use in october from product launch through december   we have shipped cell analyzers celltracks analyzer ii systems and cellspotter analyzers and celltracks autoprep systems 
from product launch until december   we have recognized revenue from the sale of cell analyzers celltracks analyzer ii systems and cellspotter analyzers and celltracks autoprep systems 
from product launch through december   we recognized revenues from the sale of systems to third party customers 
systems are comprised of one cell analyzer and one celltracks autoprep system 
these systems were sold to two major reference laboratories  to hospitals research institutes  pharmaceutical companies who intend to use the products in the development of pharmaceutical products  and to cros who offer testing services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients 
for the year ended december   we recognized revenue from the sale of cell analyzers celltracks analyzers ii and cellspotter analyzers and celltracks autoprep instruments and recorded million in instrument sales 

table of contents part ii typically  when we ship systems to customers we grant a period of time to allow the customer to evaluate the system and to perform the required validation and training before requiring that the customer purchase the system 
therefore  recognition of revenue related to instrument shipments is typically delayed for a period of several months while customers complete validation of these systems in their laboratories 
for the year ended december   we had million in reagent revenue from the sale of test kits and other consumable products to veridex and to third party customers 
for the year ended december   we had million in service revenue from our testing and research agreements with pharmaceutical companies 
our agreement with veridex provides for a total of up to million in non refundable license and milestone payments related to research and development activities  including up to million for the initial license and up to million related to the completion of certain instrument and clinical trial milestones 
we have received million as of december  we also have continuously reviewed the status of the remaining development milestones and  where appropriate  have renegotiated the development requirement and payment terms 
we do not believe that these renegotiations will have a material adverse effect on the company s product development or financial position 
we expect to earn the remaining million in development milestone payments over the next three to five years 
therefore  we expect that the revenue earned from license revenue will be inconsistent 
also  we expect to continue to invest significant amounts in research and development  particularly in clinical trials and platform development  and therefore we do not believe that these expenses will fluctuate in relation to when we expect to earn the milestone revenue referred to above 
in accordance with our policies for revenue recognition of milestone receipts we recognized   and  in the years ended  and  respectively  related to the veridex agreement 
under the veridex agreement  we also can earn up to million in revenue for achieving defined sales targets 
our agreement with veridex provides for payments to us by veridex of million  million and million in the first year that sales recognized by veridex of the cellsearch reagent products to third parties  excluding sales of instruments  reach million  million and billion  respectively 
we do not estimate that we will reach any of these sales targets until at least and therefore do not anticipate earning any sales based milestone revenues until then 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in developing reagent product kits and instrument platforms and ancillary products  as well as the clinical research and trial costs to test these kits and systems 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  payments to third parties for instrument development activities and for research related support  expenses for materials consumed in research experiments  clinical research and clinical trials  and fees paid to professional service providers in conjunction with independently monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data in conjunction with our clinical trials 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue these investments in order to realize the potential of our product candidates and proprietary technologies 
we expect to continue to incur significant costs for clinical research and for trials and to make investments to improve our instrument platforms and reagents 

table of contents part ii general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  marketing  finance  accounting  information technology  legal and human resource functions 
other costs include commissions  facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
stock based compensation expenses on january   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  using the modified prospective method 
in accordance with sfas r  the company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period 
we determine the grant date fair value of employee stock options using the black scholes option pricing model adjusted for the unique characteristics of these options 
the charge to net loss for the twelve months ended december  was million for stock based compensation 
interest income and expense interest income consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
investment holdings for the year ended december  consists primarily of federal agency notes and investment grade debt securities 
we have the intent and the ability to hold all of our debt securities until maturity and have recorded them at amortized cost 
interest expense consists of interest incurred on debt financings  including our convertible subordinated notes 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  accounting for inventory and of costs of goods sold  accounting for research and development expenses  estimating the value of our equity instruments for use in stock based compensation  derivative financial instruments  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from instrument and reagent product sales  sales of services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  license agreements and milestone achievements 
we recognize revenue on 
table of contents part ii product sales in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the product or accessory has been delivered  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue for instrument placements at the time that all necessary conditions for the recognition of revenue have been met 
specifically  we may place instruments with customers and allow the customer a period of time for training and validation as is common in our industry 
therefore there may be a delay between the time that an instrument is placed with a customer and the point at which the revenue for the instrument placement is recognized 
also in certain instances the customer may be provided with an opportunity to return the instrument to us prior to acceptance 
we therefore recognize the revenue associated with these instrument placements only at the point when it is clear that all revenue recognition criteria have been met and that no continuing right of return remains 
we record revenue from services provided as part of contracted research received under research and development support agreements and milestone payments under collaborations with third parties 
we examine each contract and consider the appropriate revenue recognition in accordance with sab and emerging issue task force  or eitf   revenue recognition with multiple deliverables  or eitf we evaluate all deliverables in our collaborative agreement to determine whether it represents separate units of accounting 
deliverables qualify for separate accounting treatment if they have standalone value to the customer and if there is objective evidence of fair value for the undelivered items 
if there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting in an arrangement  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
in accordance with sab  up front non refundable license fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the estimated development period 
since august  we have earned and received million in license and milestone payments from veridex 
license and milestone payments are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the product development period as defined for each specific product 
amounts received as reimbursement for research and development expenses are recorded as a reduction in research and development expense as the related costs are incurred 
inventory capitalization in october  we launched our initial cancer diagnostic products  which had received fda clearance in january we completed our first instrument sale to a third party laboratory customer in the fourth quarter of therefore  effective october   we initiated the practice of capitalizing inventory and recognizing cost of sales 
prior to october   all costs associated with manufacturing were included in research and development expenses 
in the fourth quarter of  we began to capitalize in inventory the cost of manufactured products held for sale and to expense the cost of products sold at the time of sale 
as a result costs incurred for products manufactured and capitalized in inventory beginning october were not categorized as costs of goods sold 
these costs had been included as part of r d expenses in prior periods 
therefore  we believe that our gross profits or losses from product sales are not comparable between periods shown 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in first out  or fifo method 
we include in inventory the raw materials that can be used in both production and clinical products 
these clinical product costs are expensed as part of research and development costs when consumed 
the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality 
the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the 
table of contents part ii demand for our products 
if our estimates for specific products is less than actual demand of products and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to write down additional inventory  which would have a negative impact on our gross margin 
the write down for estimated obsolete and excess inventory is therefore based on our collective judgment regarding the realistic and potential future demand for each product and is inherently subjective 
accounting for research and development expenses our research and development expenses are primarily composed of costs associated with product development for our cancer diagnostic products 
future research and development expenses may be directed toward development of non cancer products such as products that may be used to diagnose and identify infectious diseases or cardiovascular disease 
costs incurred to date include the development costs for instrument platforms  clinical trial and development costs and the costs associated with non clinical support activities such as manufacturing process development and regulatory services 
clinical development costs represent internal costs for personnel  external costs incurred at clinical sites and contracted payments to third party cros to perform certain clinical trials 
we have a discovery research effort  which is conducted in part on our premises by our scientists and in part through collaborative agreements with academic laboratories 
most of our research and development expenses are the result of the internal costs related directly to our employees 
we accrue external costs for clinical trials based on the progress of the clinical trials  including patient enrollment  progress of the enrolled patients through the trial  and contracted costs with cros and clinical sites 
we record internal costs primarily related to personnel in clinical development and external costs related to non clinical trials and basic research when incurred 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
actual costs incurred may not match the estimated costs for a given accounting period 
we expect that expenses in the research and development category will fluctuate for the foreseeable future as we allocate personnel to various activities  expand our clinical trial activities and increase our discovery research capabilities 
the fluctuations are difficult to predict due to the uncertainty inherent in the timing of clinical trial initiations  progress in our discovery research program  the rate of patient enrollment and the detailed design of future trials 
in addition  the results from each of our research programs and research trials will influence the number  size and duration of both planned and unplanned trials 
estimating the value of our equity instruments for use in stock based compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r 
information regarding the adoption of sfas r in our financial statements is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in adopting sfas r  we elected to apply the modified prospective transition method of reporting as allowed under sfas r and therefore have not restated prior periods 
we have elected to value our employee stock options using the black scholes method and have applied the assumptions described in the notes to the financial statements 
these assumptions describe expected volatility  anticipated term of the options and the risk free interest rate 
we used historical volatility in the assumptions for the expected volatility 
in selecting the historical volatility approach we had reviewed similar entities as well as the amex biotechnology index and based on this analysis  chose our own historical volatility as the best measure of expected volatility 
additionally  we began using the simplified calculation of expected life  described in sab management believes that this calculation provides a reasonable estimate of expected life for our employee stock options 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon the rate applicable to the us treasury security with a maturity equal to the expected term of the option on the grant date 

table of contents part ii stock based compensation recorded in the year ended december  is based on awards that are expected to vest and therefore have been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r require forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates 
forfeitures were based on historical experience 
management believes that the estimate related to the expense of stock options is a critical accounting estimate as the underlying assumptions can change from time to time 
as a result  the future compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period with respect to similar instruments 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions are evaluated periodically as conditions may arise and changes to such estimates are recorded as new information or changed as conditions require revision 
through the end of  we accounted for stock based compensation costs under sfas  as amended by sfas  which permitted i recognition of the fair value of stock based awards as an expense  or ii continued application of the intrinsic value method of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb we accounted for our stock based employee and director compensation plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb under this intrinsic value method  compensation cost represented the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our common stock at the grant date over the amount the grantee had to pay for the stock 
our policy is to grant stock options at their fair market value on the date of grant because  prior to our ipo  which was in april  there was no public market for our common stock  we have estimated the fair value of equity instruments  issued prior to our ipo  using various valuation methods  including the minimum value and the black scholes methods 
when stock options are granted with an exercise price below the estimated fair value of our common stock at the grant date  the difference between the fair value of our common stock and the exercise price of the stock option is amortized to compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the stock option 
all nonvested shares granted to executive officers are recorded as compensation expense using the fair value method under sfas r 
fair value is based upon the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the first nonvested shares to executive officers were granted in january derivative financial instruments the convertible debt issued on december   has been accounted for in accordance with sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas and the eitf no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  or eitf we do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow  market or foreign currency risks 
we review the terms of our convertible debt and equity instruments that we issue to determine whether there are embedded derivatives that need to be bifurcated and accounted for separately as a derivative 
when the embedded features risks are not clearly or closely related to the host instrument  the host instrument is not re measured at fair value and if a separate instrument with the same terms would meet the definition of a derivative  the embedded instrument is bifurcated and accounted for separately 
all three of these criteria need to be met in order to treat the embedded instrument as a derivative 
if the convertible instrument is debt  the risks associated with the embedded conversion option are not clearly and closely related to the debt instrument 
the conversion option has risks associated with an equity instrument  not a debt instrument 
if the host contract is considered to be conventional convertible debt  bifurcation of the embedded conversion option is not required 
generally  where the ability to physical or net share settle the conversion option is deemed not in our control  the embedded conversion option is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative 

table of contents part ii we may also issue options or warrants associated with the issuance of convertible debt 
although the terms of the options or warrants may not provide for net cash settlement  in certain circumstances  physical or net share settlement may not be considered in our control and  accordingly  we may be required to account for these options or warrants as derivative financial instruments and record them as a liability instead of equity 
for derivative instruments that are required to be accounted for as liabilities  the instrument would be initially recorded at its fair value and then at each reporting date  the change in fair value would be recorded in the statement of operations 
if the embedded derivative instrument is to be bifurcated and accounted for as a liability  the proceeds from an issuance will be first allocated to the fair value of the bifurcated derivative instruments 
if there are also options or warrants that are required to be recorded as a liability  the proceeds are next allocated to the fair value of those instruments 
the remaining proceeds  if any  are allocated to the convertible instrument itself  usually resulting in that instrument being recorded at a discount from the face amount 
the identification of  and accounting for  derivative instruments is complex 
for warrants and bifurcated conversion rights that are recorded as a liability  we determine fair value of these instruments using the black scholes option model  or other valuation techniques  sometimes with the assistance of a valuation consultant 
these models require assumptions related to the remaining term of the instruments  rates of return and current common stock prices  expected volatility of our common stock 
accounting for income taxes we must make significant management judgments when determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we recorded a full valuation allowance of million against our net deferred tax asset balance  due to uncertainties related to our deferred tax assets as a result of our history of operating losses 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to change the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents part ii results of operations years ended december  and revenue year ended december  in thousands product revenue instrument revenue instrument revenue from related party total instrument revenue reagent revenue reagent revenue from related party service revenue product revenue license revenue from related party other revenue total revenue instrument revenue increased by million in the year ended december  to million from million in in fiscal  we recognized the sale of analyzers celltracks analyzer ii and cellspotter analyzers and autopreps 
we sold analyzers celltracks analyzer ii and ten cellspotter instruments and celltracks autopreps in the celltracks analyzer ii was introduced in june the revenue per instrument in was approximately  compared to  in this revenue per instrument was principally the result of a price increase instituted at the time we introduced the celltracks analyzer ii 
reagent revenue increased by million in the year ended december  to million as compared to  in we expect our reagent revenue to increase in and beyond as we continue to increase the number of instruments installed and as veridex continues to promote the cellsearch test 
these two factors taken together should help to increase the volume of cellsearch tests sold 
in the past year we have offered laboratory services to aid pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the development of drug candidates  including clinical trial support 
up until august we derived service revenue from one contract 
in the second half of we entered into a number of agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to aid in the research associated with their drug candidates and also entered into laboratory service agreements to perform clinical trial testing 
as such  service revenues increased to million for fiscal compared to  in we believe that service revenue will increase in as we continue to expand the number of these service and contracted research agreements 
license revenue from related parties decreased to  in from million in we have received a total of million in license and milestone payments under the terms of the development agreement with veridex from august  to december  these achievements are recognized as revenue over the estimated product development period for the corresponding product  which we estimate will end at various points through december  to date  we have recognized 
table of contents part ii approximately million of the million 
we have also continuously reviewed the status of the remaining development milestones and  where appropriate  have renegotiated the development requirement and payment terms 
we do not believe that these renegotiations will have a material adverse effect on the company s product development or financial position 
we expect to receive million in development milestone payments over the next three to five years 
as a result of the above  total revenue increased to million in from million in cost of goods sold year ended december  in thousands instruments revenue cost of goods sold gross profit reagents revenue cost of goods sold gross profit service revenue cost of goods sold gross profit costs of goods sold increased to million in the year ended december  from million in we began capitalizing inventory and recognizing the corresponding cost of goods sold in october after the launch of our initial ivd products 
the instrument cost of goods sold includes estimated warranty service costs and other costs related to initial installation 
as a result of our low volumes  we are unable to capitalize all of our manufacturing expenses and therefore we have not yet reached levels sufficient to generate gross profits on product sales 
we began capitalizing inventory and recognizing the corresponding cost of goods sold in october after the launch of our initial ivd products 
up to october we expensed costs that would have otherwise been capitalized as part of inventory 
therefore  included in the revenue is approximately million of product revenue with no corresponding cost of goods sold 
in the th quarter of  we ceased reporting our results as a development stage company 
prior to this  a large portion of our manufacturing and operations group supported our research and development efforts and therefore we allocated to r d expenses 
in  all of our manufacturing costs are allocated to costs of goods sold 
in costs of services associated with service revenue are included in r d expenses 
we began offering pharma services in while still in the development stage 
we had only one customer during and therefore did not deem pharma services to be a distinct segment of our business with separate costs of services provided until 
table of contents part ii research and development expenses a summary of the principal components of our research and development costs for the years ended december  and is shown below year ended december  research and development expenses in thousands salaries  benefits and taxes laboratory supplies and expenses instrument development costs clinical trial expenses contracted research costs depreciation insurance all others total research and development expenses research and development  or r d  expenses decreased by million  or  to million in from million in the reduction of is the result of a number of factors 
first  in august  we reduced our staff by and reduced other expenses in order to align costs with our commercialization strategy and anticipated sales volume 
the effect of the staff reduction and related costs savings accounts for approximately million of the reduced costs 
second  in the th quarter of  we ceased reporting our results as a development stage company 
prior to this  a large portion of our manufacturing and operations group supported our research and development efforts and therefore we allocated to r d expenses 
in  all of our manufacturing costs are allocated to costs of goods sold and this resulted in a million reduction in our r d expenses 
clinical trial expenses decreased in by million to million from million in we initiated a clinical trial for the monitoring of metastatic colorectal cancer in the second quarter of in january  based on encouraging interim data  we decided to increase the number of patients to be included in the trial from the original trial size of patients up to we increased our enrollment efforts in order to attempt to complete our patient enrollment by december  also  in october  we initiated a pivotal clinical trial for the monitoring of metastatic prostate cancer 
as the patient accrual for both trials was substantially completed at december   our clinical trial expenditures decreased significantly in in september  we announced that we had achieved our primary and secondary endpoints in our pivotal clinical trial in the management of metastatic colorectal cancer 
in january  we announced that we had achieved our primary endpoints in our clinical trial in the management of metastatic prostate cancer 
commercialization of these two clinical indications is subject to a number of factors  including but not limited to clearance for sale by the fda 
we anticipate that we will submit the data from these trials to the fda in finally  in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of all outstanding stock options held by immunicon s current officers  employees  consultants and advisors with an exercise price of at least per share 
options held by immunicon s executive officers and members of the board were excluded from the vesting acceleration 
unvested stock options that had an exercise price of less than per share will continue to vest on their normal schedule 
in the prior years  we had been recording stock based compensation in regards to our pre ipo option grants 
we expect that r d costs in will be materially consistent with levels 
while we will continue to engage in improving our instrument and reagent products we are substantially completed with their 
table of contents part ii initial development 
we have also completed the principal clinical trials necessary to commercialize these products 
we plan to shift certain of our development efforts toward the products in the life sciences research and molecular analysis areas as well as for use in the area of services for drug development 
each of our r d programs is subject to risks and uncertainties  including the requirement to obtain regulatory approval  that are outside of our control 
as a result of these risks and uncertainties  we are unable to predict the period in which we will achieve profitability 
for example  our clinical trials may be subject to delays or rejections for a variety of reasons  such as our inability to obtain applicable clearances from the fda or institutional or ethical review boards or to enroll patients at the rate that we expect 
moreover  the product candidates we are developing must overcome significant technological and marketing challenges before they can be successfully commercialized 
general and administrative expenses a summary of the principal components of our g a costs for the years ended december  and is shown below year ended december  general and administrative expenses in thousands salaries  benefits and taxes professional fees commissions depreciation insurance all others total general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses  or g a  increased by million  or  to million in from million in salary related costs increased by million in due to a number of factors 
first  in  we adopted statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no r  or sfas r  share based payment  which requires that costs associated with stock based compensation be expensed in the current period 
as previously stated  our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of certain options for employees 
senior officers and board of directors were excluded from the accelerated vesting and therefore g a was affected 
stock based compensation increased million associated with the adoption of fasr and issuance of nonvested shares to our senior officers 
also  in august  the board approved a change to the compensation of mr 
hewett  our ceo 
in order to facilitate mr 
hewett s relocation from his home in new york to the philadelphia area  the board approved the engagement of a relocation company to aid mr 
hewett in the sale of his home in new york 
the agreement between the relocation company and us provides that the relocation company will provide mr 
hewett with marketing assistance in the sale of his new york home 
the agreement further provides that  at mr 
hewett s option  the relocation company will purchase the home from mr 
hewett at fair market value and include the home in its inventory for sale 
we will reimburse the relocation company for expenses related to the purchase and sale of mr 
hewett s new york home  including any loss on the sale incurred by the relocation company 
mr 
hewett exercised this option in october and the relocation company is now seeking to sell the home 
in addition  we separately agreed to reimburse mr 
hewett for costs associated with the search for and closing on the purchase of his new home in the philadelphia area 
lastly  we agreed to reimburse 
table of contents part ii mr 
hewett for costs associated with the shipment of his household goods into his new home 
the reimbursement payments to mr 
hewett also include the amount of mr 
hewett s anticipated united states federal income tax liability with respect to such reimbursements and with respect to the payments to the relocation company 
we anticipate that the reimbursements to mr 
hewett and the payments to the relocation company will aggregate between  and  but actual costs will depend on a number of factors  including the final sale proceeds of mr 
hewett s home in new york 
as of december   we have recorded  for these expenses as part of salaries  benefits and taxes in g a 
the remaining increase in salaries relates to the additional personnel hired in our marketing department  performance bonuses for management and annual increases for salaries 
the remaining increase in g a relates to commissions on our instruments to our marketing and selling partner  veridex 
we sold instruments to third party customers in as compared to in the average sales of instruments are up due to the introduction of the celltracks analyzer ii in mid we believe that our general and administrative expenses may increase in we anticipate hiring additional sales and marketing personnel as we pursue other opportunities outside the veridex contract 
we do not anticipate other large increases to our general and administrative expenses based on our current business plan 
however  there can be no assurance that we will successfully commercialize any new product candidates 
interest and other income interest and other income increased by  or  in up to million from million in the increase in interest income was primarily the result of higher average interest rates on our investments in as compared to expense related to conversion rights and warrant value we have determined to value certain provisions of the notes and related warrants separately in accordance with various accounting guidance  including sfas and eitf as such  we ve recorded a liability for both the warrants and conversion features 
the warrants and conversion features are required to be adjusted to their fair value each quarter as a charge to earnings 
the fair value of these warrants is primarily affected by our stock price  but is also affected by our stock price volatility  expected life and the risk free interest rates 
the fair value of the conversion rights is primarily affected by our stock price  but is also affected by our stock price volatility  expected life and our incremental borrowing rate 
the million expense in the fourth quarter of relates primarily to the increase in the company s stock during the time from the closing of the transaction and end of the quarter 
assuming the company s stock volatility  dividend payments  and the risk free or incremental borrowing interest rates remain constant  the fair value of the warrants would increase and the company would recognize a charge to earnings if the price of the company s stock increases 
if the price of the company s stock decreases and the company s stock volatility  dividend payments  and the risk free interest rates remain constant  the fair value of the warrants will decrease and the company will recognize income 
interest expense interest expense increased by  to  in from  in this increase is primarily related to our new financing in december we issued million of convertible 
table of contents part ii subordinated notes with detachable warrants 
these notes have a interest coupon which is payable at maturity of the notes 
in addition  we paid financing fees of million 
these fees are amortized into interest expense over the term of the debt 
in addition  the discount on the notes is also amortized into expense 
please see critical accounting policies and our debt footnote for more detail explanation 
this increase is partially offset by the lower interest expense on the senior debt due to declining balance 
stock based compensation expenses on january   we adopted sfas r 
in adopting sfas r  we elected to apply the modified prospective transition method of reporting as allowed under sfas r and therefore have not restated prior periods 
through the end of  we accounted for stock based compensation costs under sfas  as amended by sfas  which permitted i recognition of the fair value of stock based awards as an expense  or ii continued application of the intrinsic value method of accounting principles board  or apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb we accounted for our stock based employee and director compensation plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb during the period from october  through december  prior to our ipo and determined with hindsight  we issued options to certain employees and directors under the plan with exercise prices below the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant  in accordance with the requirements of apb no 
 we have recorded deferred stock based compensation for the difference between the exercise price of the stock options and the estimated fair value of our stock on the date of grant 
deferred compensation is amortized to compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the stock option 
we have also recorded compensation expense when stock options are issued to non employees such as consultants and advisors 
in december  we accelerated the vesting of options with strike prices over for employees other than senior executive officers and board of directors 
stock based compensation expenses were million and million for the years and  respectively 
we issued  options in and  options in in prior year  we issued  nonvested shares to certain officers 
the stock based compensation consisted of the following year ended december  in thousands adoption of sfas r nonvested shares stock options granted prior to our ipo at below fair market value stock based compensation 
table of contents part ii we recognized these expenses as part of cost of sales  research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses as shown below 
year ended december  stock based compensation expenses included in in thousands cost of goods sold research and development expenses general and administrative expenses net loss as a result of the above  the net loss of million in was million  or  lower than the loss of million in the loss per common share was in  which was  or  lower than the loss per common share of in weighted average common shares outstanding for the year ended december  and were and million  respectively 
as a result of the risks and uncertainties associated with development and commercialization activities  we are unable to predict the period in which we will achieve profitability 
for example  we remain highly dependent on veridex to successfully market and sell our cancer products 
if they are unable to successfully market these products we will experience delays in achieving or may never reach profitability 
the fair value of the derivative liabilities are subject to the changes in our common stock value 
as such  our financial statements may fluctuate quarter to quarter based on the price of our stock at the balance sheet date 
therefore  our financial position and results of operations may vary quarter to quarter based on conditions other than our operating revenue and expenses 
these fair value changes will represent non cash charges or income in our statement of operations 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue year ended december  in thousands product revenue instrument revenue instrument revenue from related party total instrument revenue reagent revenue reagent revenue from related party product revenue license revenue from related party other revenue total revenue 
table of contents part ii instrument revenue increased by million in the year ended december  to million from  in this increase is primarily related to fact that we sold products for the entire year of compared to four months in we began selling our initial cancer diagnostic products in august we sold autoprep instruments  ten cellspotter instruments and ctaii s in compared to ten autoprep instruments  ten cellspotter instruments and no ctaii s in the ctaii was introduced in june reagent revenue increased by  in the year ended december  to  as compared to  in included in the revenue is approximately million of product revenue with no corresponding cost of goods sold 
license revenue from related parties increased to million in from  in on march   we successfully earned the milestone relating to the enrollment of the first patient into the bone marrow study 
veridex paid us  for achieving this milestone 
we will recognize this receipt as revenue over the estimated life of the bone marrow study which we estimate will be completed in the second quarter of in  we received  in milestone payments from veridex for achieving development related milestones during the license revenue for these milestones will be recognized over the respective estimated product development period which we estimate will end at various times through december  other revenue increased by  to  in the year ended december  from  in this increase is primarily related to testing services performed under our contract with pfizer  inc as a result of the above  total revenue increased to million in from million in cost of goods sold costs of goods sold increased to million in the year ended december  from zero in we began capitalizing inventory and recognizing the corresponding cost of goods sold in october after the launch of our initial ivd products 
instrument cost of goods sold was million and reagent cost of goods was  for the year ended december  the instrument cost of goods sold includes estimated warranty service costs and other costs related to initial installation 
we typically sell our instruments at or near our cost 
in costs of services associated with service revenue are included in r d expenses 
we began offering pharma services in while still in the development stage 
we had only one customer during and therefore did not deem pharma services to be a distinct segment of our business with separate costs of services provided until year ended december  in thousands instruments revenue cost of goods sold gross profit reagents revenue cost of goods sold gross profit service revenue cost of service sold gross profit 
table of contents part ii research and development expenses a summary of the principal components of our research and development costs for the years ended december  and is shown below year ended december  research and development expenses in thousands salaries  benefits and taxes laboratory supplies and expenses instrument development costs clinical trial expenses contracted research costs depreciation insurance all others total research and development expenses research and development  or r d  expenses decreased by million  or  to million in from million in salary and salary related costs were  or  higher in compared to we required higher staff levels to complete the development of certain instrument platforms and complete the development of our initial cancer monitoring test 
we hired additional personnel during the second half of to support the commercial launch of our initial products  to support clinical development to expand applications of our cancer diagnostic technology and to expand uses of our technology beyond cancer to other disease states 
this increase was offset by the reduction in salaries and other areas related to the staff reduction announced in august the portion of stock based compensation expenses recognized as part of research and development salaries was million in versus million in laboratory supplies and expenses were million  or  lower in than in we began capitalizing inventory related costs in the fourth quarter of prior to that time  all product and inventory material purchases were recorded as an r d expense  principally as laboratory supplies 
as a result  inventory items that we expensed as laboratory supplies and materials in were capitalized in thereby reducing the lab supplies expenses for clinical trial expenses were million  or  higher in than in we initiated our clinical trials in metastatic colorectal and prostate cancer in the second half of patient enrollment for these trials was substantially completed by the end of instrument development costs decreased by  or 
in june we launched our second generation cell analyzer  the ctaii 
although we continue to make improvements to our instrument platforms  the principal development work for the ctaii was completed and costs associated with development of this instrument  especially contracted development costs  declined thereafter 
contracted research costs decreased by  or  in over we incurred higher costs associated with manufacturing validation efforts in the first half of as we prepared for the launch of our initial ivd products in august costs related to contracted research declined thereafter 
depreciation expense increased by  or  to million in compared to million in this was primarily due to the addition of space to our research facilities area in for additional research and clinical work being performed 

table of contents part ii general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in salary related costs increased by  in due principally to the addition of our chief operating officer who was hired in late to manage the cancer business  manufacturing operations  regulatory affairs and strategic marketing and to other senior staff additions which occurred in and to support our transition to a public company 
also  in november  our board of directors approved a top management succession plan promoting our chief operating officer to president and chief executive officer  which became effective january  we recognized stock based compensation expense of  in compared to  in  which was included in salary costs 
professional fees  including legal and accounting fees  increased by  or  to million in from million in this increase is primarily due to costs associated with certification of our internal controls required by the sarbanes oxley act of and other public company reporting requirements 
interest income interest income increased by  or  in up to million from  in the increase in interest income was primarily the result of higher interest rates on our investments 
interest expense interest expense decreased by  or  to  in from  in this decrease was due to decrease in the average interest rate on new indebtedness in versus the higher interest rate on debt that was being paid down 
stock based compensation expenses during the period from october  through december  prior to our ipo and determined with hindsight  we issued options to certain employees and directors under the plan with exercise prices below the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant  in accordance with the requirements of apb no 
 we have recorded deferred stock based compensation for the difference between the exercise price of the stock options and the estimated fair value of our stock on the date of grant 
deferred compensation is amortized to compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the stock option 
we have also recorded compensation expense when stock options are issued to non employees such as consultants and advisors 
stock based compensation expenses were million and million for the years and  respectively 
we issued  options in and  options in in addition  we issued  nonvested shares to certain officers in and recorded deferred compensation of million and compensation expense of  related to the issuance of these nonvested shares 
we will amortize the deferred compensation through the vesting period for the common stock options and nonvested shares 
in december  our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of all outstanding stock options held by our current officers and employees with an exercise price of at least per share 
since the option price was in excess of the fair market value  or out of the money on that date  no compensation expense was recorded 
options held by our executive officers and members of the board were excluded from the vesting acceleration 
unvested stock options that had an exercise price of less than per share will continue to vest on their normal schedule 
as a result of this vesting acceleration  options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock have become fully vested 

table of contents part ii we recognized these expenses as part of research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses as shown below 
year ended december  stock based compensation expenses included in in thousands research and development expenses general and administrative expenses net loss as a result of the above  the net loss of million in was million  or  lower than the loss of million in the loss per common share was in  which was  or  lower than the loss per common share of in weighted average common shares outstanding for the year ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception through private and public equity and debt financings  with revenue generated from sales of products and services  with license and milestone revenues from corporate collaborations  with capital equipment and leasehold financing  with government grants and with interest earned on cash and investments 
we recognized million and million in product revenues in and  respectively 
based on reaching certain commercialization goals including sales of our products we determined that effective with the beginning of the fourth quarter of we were no longer a development stage company 
cash and short term investments increased by million in the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was principally the result of receiving million in net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible debt in december offset by the net loss of million for the year ended december  we used million in our operating activities in the year ended december  compared to million in the decrease in net cash used of approximately million was primarily the result of improved operating results in  particularly lower operating expenses in of million compared to million in we generated a net increase of million in cash provided by investing activities in the year ended december  compared to an increase of million in the year ended december  in  we generated million through the purchases and maturities of investments and spent million in purchases of property and equipment 
in  we generated million through the purchase and sale of investments and we spent million to purchase property and equipment 
cash increased by million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively as a result of financing activities 
in december  we issued million in subordinated convertible debt 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of the notes and warrants after deducting the placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses see further discussions below 
in  we borrowed million against our senior debt facilities and paid down million on these facilities 
in june  we raised million in proceeds  net of fees and expenses  through the sale of million shares of common stock pursuant to shelf registration statement 
table of contents part ii filed in may we received cash proceeds from bank borrowings of million and made principal repayments of million in in december  we entered into a definitive agreement for the sale and issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured subordinated convertible promissory notes  or notes  which are convertible initially into an aggregate of up to  shares of our common stock 
the notes bear interest at per annum 
interest is not payable currently but is accrued and added to the principal on a quarterly basis 
any portion of the notes and all accrued but unpaid interest which is not converted is repayable in cash on december  this agreement also includes warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the notes are convertible into shares at a conversion price of 
the warrants have an exercise price of per shares 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of the notes and warrants after deducting the placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses of million  million of which were paid as of december  the remainder was paid by the end of january these convertible notes contain certain covenants that require us to  among other things  maintain a certain level of cash  restrict amount of indebtedness and restriction on redemption and cash dividends 
we were in compliance with all provisions of our notes  including the available cash test  as of and for the year ended december  we have determined to value the conversion rights and the related warrants separately in accordance with fas and eitf as such  we recorded an initial liability of million and million for the conversion rights associated with the notes and for the warrants  respectively 
the result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the conversion rights and detachable warrants is marked to market each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability 
as of december   we have recorded an expense of million relating to our mark to market adjustment 
at december  and  respectively  we did not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
we have funded our expenditures to date principally through the sale of our stock and through the issuance of convertible subordinated notes 
our expenditures are primarily research and development and other operating expenditures  capital equipment expenditures and payments on outstanding indebtedness 
sales of our common and preferred stock from inception through december  are as follows summary of all sales of common and convertible preferred stock year s number of shares price per share net proceeds in thousands equivalent common shares initial sale of common stock private convertible preferred stock series a series b series c series d series e series f initial public offering common stock sale of common stock secondary offering exercise of options and warrants and other sales of common stock various   
table of contents part ii at completion of the ipo  all outstanding convertible preferred shares were automatically converted into  common shares 
on may   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec 
the shelf registration statement permits the offer  sale and issuance by us from time to time  in one or more offerings  of up to an aggregate of million of our common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants  depositary shares  stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units 
the terms of any offering will be established at the time of the offering 
on june   we sold  shares of our common stock at per share pursuant to this shelf registration statement and received million in proceeds  net of fees and other expenses 
in december  we entered into a definitive agreement for the sale and issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of notes  which are convertible initially into an aggregate of up to  shares of our common stock 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and related interest charges on lines of credit at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due in contractual obligations total and and after in thousands lines of credit  including interest expense convertible subordinated notes payable operating leases open purchase order commitments total contractual obligations obligation includes principal and total interest that would be accrued if the notes are not converted prior to maturity date 
the amounts included in open purchase order commitments are subject to performance under the purchase order by the supplier of the goods or services and do not become our obligation until such performance is rendered 
the amount shown is principally for the purchase of materials for our instrument platforms  which we anticipate will be sold by us to customers and for various items such as contingent patient accrual commitments related to our clinical trials 
most patient accrual costs are payable only after successful completion of patient accrual 
we are liable for certain payments under employment contracts with our chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief scientific officer and chief counsel 
these contracts require that we continue salary and benefits for these officers for a period of one year and that we accelerate any unvested options  if any  if the officer is terminated  except for cause  or in the event of a change of control  as defined in the contracts 
these amounts are not included in the table above 
we also have contingent obligations for research and development and clinical trial expenditures under our development  license and supply agreement with veridex 
specifically  we must pay the first million in clinical trial costs for the first cellular analysis product for general population screening for a major cancer  and veridex is responsible for the next million of such clinical trial costs 
we have agreed to negotiate in good faith for the allocation of costs in excess of million 
as of december  we have not incurred any costs related to clinical trials for a product for general population screening  and we do not anticipate spending any funds on clinical trials toward such a product through the development  license and supply agreement with veridex provides for a total of up to million in non refundable license and milestone payments related to research and development activities  
table of contents part ii including up to million for the initial license and up to million related to the completion of certain instrument and clinical trial milestones 
we have received million as of december  we have also continuously reviewed the status of the remaining development milestones and  where appropriate  have renegotiated the development requirement and payment terms 
we do not believe that these renegotiations will have a material adverse effect on our product development or financial position 
we expect to earn the remaining million in development milestone payments over the next three to five years 
if we do not successfully complete the payment criteria for a given future milestone  we will not receive the applicable milestone payment 
if we do not successfully complete the payment criteria by the target date for a given milestone  we will continue to be entitled to receive the milestone payment in the future upon successful completion of the criteria 
however  veridex s obligation to pay us a percentage of the net sales for the specific cell analysis product to which the milestone relates would be reduced by for the ten year period beginning with the shipment for commercial sale of the first product resulting from this agreement 
in no event  however  would reductions due to missed target dates reduce our proportionate percentage share of net sales for the product specified that we would otherwise be entitled to receive from veridex for sales of all cell analysis products by veridex under this agreement by more than in the aggregate 
in the case of the cellsearch product related to metastatic breast cancer we agreed with veridex that we did not reach a certain development milestone within the time period specified and therefore we will receive approximately of net sales for this product 
if we achieve certain levels of sales of our reagents we may receive up to an additional million in milestone payments from veridex although we do not expect to receive any milestone payments related to sales goals until at least veridex is responsible under the agreement for obtaining all regulatory clearances  in consultation with us  for these cell analysis products in the field of cancer 
we have also established a sales agency arrangement with veridex with respect to our sample preparation and cell analysis systems 
under this arrangement  veridex is our exclusive sales  invoicing and collecting agent and exclusive instrument and technical service provider for these systems in the field of cancer 
veridex is responsible for all expenses for marketing  sales and training  and we are responsible for all development and validation as well as quality control and quality assurance 
we are responsible for shipping systems pursuant to purchase orders received by veridex 
we are obligated to pay veridex a commission on each sale or lease of these sample preparation and cell analysis systems of up to of the invoice price  subject to a minimum gross profit margin received by us on each system of  as defined in the agreement 
some customers may enter into a reagent rental agreement with veridex  whereby the reagent price also carries an amortized cost of the instrument  based on an agreed test volume 
in these cases  veridex will pay us a percentage of the fully loaded cost of the instrument when it is placed in the account 
we are responsible for the costs associated with the one year warranty period 
veridex has the option under the agreement to convert the sales agency relationship to a sole distributorship arrangement upon months written notice 
however  we do not anticipate earning significant gross margins or incurring significant losses on the sale  lease or rental of our instrument systems 
we anticipate that the majority of our future gross margins and future profits derived under our agreement with veridex will result from the sales of reagents and disposables 
we launched our first cancer diagnostic products in october this represents the beginning of the commercialization phase as defined in our development  license and supply agreement 
according to the development  license and supply agreement once commercialization begins  we are required to invest an amount ranging from between and of total net product sales by veridex  excluding revenue 
table of contents part ii from cell analysis system sales  in research and development activities for cancer related cell analysis products 
these research and development activities may consist of any activities  such as product improvements  product line extensions and clinical trials  conducted to achieve the milestones described above  to advance the development program designed by the steering committee for this agreement  or to enhance the cancer related cell analysis products or sample preparation and cell analysis systems based on our technologies 
the agreement has an initial term of years and is automatically renewed for three year terms unless earlier terminated 
there are various conditions that allow either party to terminate the agreement  including a material breach by either party or by mutual agreement 
veridex may also terminate for additional reasons including upon a change of control of us  as defined in the agreement  at any time prior to commercialization of any cell analysis products under the agreement with or without reason upon days prior written notice  or at any time following commercialization of the first cell analysis product under the agreement with or without reason upon months prior written notice 
at this time we believe the latter provision is in effect due to initiation of commercialization in in certain circumstances of termination  veridex may  at its option  retain certain worldwide rights to sell our cell analysis products if it agrees to pay us any unpaid license and milestone payments and an ongoing net sales royalty 
johnson and johnson development corporation beneficially own approximately of our common stock and is a wholly owned subsidiary of johnson johnson  inc in december  we signed a definitive license  development  supply and distribution agreement to develop and commercialize products in the field of clinical virology diagnostics  starting with a panel of multiplex respiratory virus and sexually transmitted infection assays with dhi 
the agreement terms are in effect for a period ending on the fifth anniversary of the commencement of the commercial period and either party may elect to extend the original term for an additional five years 
we received an upfront non refundable license fee of  and are eligible for an additional million upon approval by the fda for the first initial product 
in addition  in consideration for our performance of our obligations in the development of new products under the agreement  dhi will pay us a quarterly payment of  for six fiscal quarters  beginning january we will manufacture and supply dhi with their requirements for bulk reagents and dhi will manufacture and supply the detection reagents 
we will receive of the revenue from the sale of these reagents 
dhi will act as our distributor for the instrument systems 
dhi will be responsible for all expenses for sales and training with respect to products and systems 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in available credit under our credit agreements 
the available borrowing capacity under our silicon valley bank  or svb  credit facility was million and it expires on december  and the available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement with general electric credit corporation  or ge  was million and it expires april  we were in compliance with all provisions of our various loans as of and for the years ended december  and the svb credit agreement contains certain covenants that require us to  among other things  maintain a certain level of earnings or loss before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  maintain a minimum amount of our available funds on deposit with svb and deliver periodic financial statements and reports within a prescribed timeframe 
the agreements with svb and ge also restrict our ability to among other things  dispose of property including intellectual property  change our business  ownership  management or business locations  merge with or acquire certain other entities  create or incur certain liens or encumbrances on any of its property  incur or amend the terms of certain indebtedness  engage in transactions with affiliates  declare or pay certain dividends or redeem  retire or purchase shares of any capital stock without their prior approval 
on june  we announced that we  along with the fox chase cancer center  or fox chase  were awarded a small business technology transfer grant totaling approximately from the national 
table of contents part ii institutes of health nih  which extends over two years 
we believe that we will receive approximately  and that fox chase will receive the remainder of  the nih grant is intended to fund the development of a new strategy to actively monitor the effectiveness of cancer drugs in clinical trials 
we received  and  from this grant for the years ended december  and december  on august   we announced actions to align staff levels and other expenses with our current commercialization strategy and sales volume and reduced our workforce by approximately 
in fiscal year  we recorded  in accelerated depreciation of certain property and equipment resulting from the termination of the lease of a portion of our office space 
we completed the consolidation of office space in the first half of as of december   all severance costs relating to this workforce reduction had been paid 
we have recorded total expense of  related to the workforce reduction and the accelerated depreciation since we announced these actions in august these items were recorded in our operating expenses 
based on our operating plans  we believe that our available cash and available borrowings under of lines of credit will be sufficient to finance operations and capital expenditures until at least december  our future capital requirements include  but are not limited to  supporting our research and development efforts and our clinical trials  although we are not obligated to meet any absolute minimum dollar spending requirements under our current operating agreements 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the scope and progress made in our research and development activities  our clinical trials and capital requirements related to our commercialization efforts 
we had million in cash on hand and short term investments and million in available lines of credit as of december  we plan to use our cash on hand and our available lines of credit to continue to develop our cancer diagnostic products beyond breast cancer to other types of solid tissue cancers and to explore the uses of our technology in earlier stages of the cancer disease process 
also  we plan to explore development of uses for our technology outside of cancer such as in cardiovascular disease 
we plan to use the anticipated funds generated from the sales of our products as well as additional equity or debt related offerings to finance our future development efforts 
we may not be successful in generating sufficient product sales or raising sufficient funds from the sale of equity or debt securities to support the research and development expenses necessary to expand the uses of the technology into other cancers and in non cancer diseases 
in addition  if we are unsuccessful in our product development efforts  additional financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may elect to reduce the scope of  delay or eliminate some or all of our planned research  development and commercialization activities 
this inability to obtain additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results
