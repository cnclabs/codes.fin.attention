executive level overview a majority of our revenues are driven by marketing and advertising spending by consumer product companies and retailers 
the markets served are consumer product manufacturers and pharmaceutical  entertainment  retail and publishing companies 
our business involves producing graphic images for various applications 
generally  a graphic image is created by us or a third party and then the company manipulates that image to enhance the color of the image and to prepare it for print 
the applications vary from consumer product packaging  including food and beverage packaging images  to retail advertisements in newspapers  including free standing inserts fsi s and magazine ads 
the graphics process is generally the same regardless of the application 
the following steps in the graphics process must take place to produce a final image planning and messaging strategic design content creation file building retouching art production pre media the company s involvement in a client project may involve many of the above steps or just one of the steps  depending on the client s needs 
each client assignment  or job  is a custom job in that the image being produced is unique  even if it only involves a small change from an existing image  such as adding a low fat banner on a food package 
essentially  change equals revenue 
the company is paid for our graphic imaging work regardless of the success or failure of the food product  the promotion or the ad campaign 
historically  a substantial majority of our revenues have been derived from providing graphic services for consumer product packaging applications 
packaging changes occur with such frequency and lack of notice  and customer turn around requirements are so tight  that there is little backlog 
there are regular promotions throughout 
table of contents the year that create revenue opportunities for us  for example valentine s day  easter  fourth of july  back to school  halloween  thanksgiving and christmas 
in addition  there are event driven promotions that occur regularly  such as the super bowl  grammy awards  world series  indianapolis and the olympics 
lastly  there are a number of health related banners that are added to food and beverage packaging  such as heart healthy  low in carbohydrates  enriched with essential vitamins  low in saturated fat and caffeine free 
all of these items require new product packaging designs or changes in existing designs  in each case creating additional opportunities for revenue 
graphic services for the consumer products packaging industry generally involve higher margins due to the substantial expertise necessary to meet consumer products companies precise specifications and to quickly  consistently and efficiently bring their products to market  as well as due to the complexity and variety of packaging materials  shapes and sizes  custom colors and storage conditions 
as a result of our most recent acquisitions described below  the company has increased the percentage of our revenue derived from providing graphics services to our advertising and retail clients and added to our service offering graphic services to the entertainment market 
these clients typically require high volume  commodity oriented prepress graphic services 
graphic services for these clients typically yield relatively lower margins due to the lower degree of complexity in providing such services  and the number and size of companies in the industry capable of providing such services 
as discussed more fully below under acquisitions and results of operations  the altered mix of services following our acquisitions of winnetts and seven has impacted our results of operations in and and will continue to impact our results of operations in the future 
the company continues to review its operations to identify potential dispositions of assets that fail to meet our criteria for growth and profitability 
the company s ten largest clients accounted for approximately of our revenues in and of our revenues in in and  approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues came from our largest single client in the respective period 
while the company seeks to build long term client relationships  revenues from any particular client can fluctuate from period to period due to such client s purchasing patterns 
any termination of or significant reduction in our business relationship with any of our principal clients could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
acquisitions the company has grown our business through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions 
schawk has completed approximately acquisitions since the company s recent acquisitions have significantly expanded our service offerings and our geographic presence  making us the only independent prepress firm with operations in north america  europe and asia 
as a result of these acquisitions  the company is able to offer a broader range of services to our clients 
our expanded geographic presence also allows us to better serve our multinational clients demands for global brand consistency

management believes that the level of working capital is adequate for the company s liquidity needs related to normal operations both currently and in the foreseeable future  and that the company has sufficient resources to support its growth  either through currently available cash and cash generated from future operations  or pursuant to its revolving credit facility

the company expects to fund future contractual obligations through funds generated from operations  together with general company financing transactions 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of 
table of contents contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable 
our clients are primarily consumer product manufacturers  converters and advertising agencies  none of which individually represents more than of total revenue 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities 
in assessing the carrying value of its accounts receivable  the company estimated the recoverability by making assumptions based on past collection history and specific risks identified in the accounts receivable portfolio 
based on the company s estimates and assumptions  an allowance for doubtful accounts of  was established at december   compared to an allowance of  at december  a change in the company s assumptions would result in the company recovering an amount of its accounts receivable that differs from the carrying value 
any difference could result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company records impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
no events or changes in circumstances have occurred that required the company to assess the recoverability of its property and equipment  and therefore the company has not recognized any impairment charges 
a change in the company s business climate in future periods  including a general downturn in one of the company s operations  could lead to a required assessment of the recoverability of the company s long lived assets  which may subsequently result in an impairment charge 
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
the company has made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
effective in  goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to an annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
other intangible assets that meet certain criteria continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are also subject to an impairment test based on estimated undiscounted cash flows 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
therefore  impairment losses could be recorded in the future 
the company performed the required impairment test of goodwill in  and and did not record an impairment charge 
customer rebates 
the company has rebate agreements with certain customers 
the agreements offer discount pricing based on volume over a multi year period 
the company accrues the estimated rebates over the term of the agreement  reducing revenue and crediting a current liability account 
at the end of the rebate accounting period  typically annually  the rebate is settled in cash and the accrued liability account is charged 
the company accounts for changes in the estimated rebate amounts as soon as it has determined that the estimated sales for the rebate period have changed 
stock based compensation 
as of december   the company had three stock based compensation plans which are described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
effective january   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payments  sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
sfas r supersedes the company s previous accounting methodology using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under the intrinsic value method  no share based compensation expense related to stock option awards granted to employees had been recognized in 
table of contents the company s consolidated statements of operations  as all stock option awards granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the common stock on the date of the grant 
the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  compensation expense recognized during the year ended december  included compensation expense for all share based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas and using an accelerated expense attribution method 
compensation expense during the year ended december  for share based awards granted subsequent to january  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r and is computed using the straight line expense attribution method 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  the company s consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of sfas r 
the company must make certain assumptions in determining the fair value of stock options  including the volatility of the company s common stock  the future dividend yield on the company s common stock  and the term over which stock options will remain outstanding  including making assumptions about the future behavior patterns of the holders of stock options in regard to exercising stock options prior to their expiration 
in addition  the company must make certain assumptions regarding the rate at which options will be forfeited to estimate the service period that will be completed by the holders of stock options 
any deviation in the actual volatility of the company s common stock  the actual dividend yield  and the actual early exercise behavior of holders of stock options from that assumed in estimating the fair value of a stock option will not result in a change in the amount of compensation expense recognized by the company  but will result in the actual value realized by the holder of the stock options to be different than the amount of compensation expense recognized 
any deviation in the actual forfeitures of nonvested stock options during the service period from that assumed will result in a change to the amount of compensation expense recognized  either as additional compensation expense or a reversal of previously recognized compensation expense in the period of change 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences and net operating losses will not be realized 
schawk  like other multi national companies  are regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
accordingly  tax reserves have been recorded when  in management s judgment  it is not probable that our tax position will ultimately be sustained 
while predicting the outcome of the audits involves uncertainty and requires estimates and informed judgments  the company believes that the recorded tax liabilities are adequate and appropriate 
the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits  as well as changes to or further interpretation of regulations 
income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which these events occur or when the statute of limitations for a specific exposure item has expired 
exit reserves 
the company records reserves for the consolidation of workforce and facilities of acquired companies 
the exit plans are approved by company management prior to  or shortly after  the acquisition date and may be modified during the twelve month period following the acquisition  as conditions change 
the exit plans provide for severance pay  lease abandonment costs and other related expenses 
a change in any of the assumptions used to estimate the exit reserves that result in a decrease to the reserve would result in a decrease to goodwill 
any change in assumptions that result in an increase to the exit reserves would result in a charge to income 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  while our analysis of the impact this interpretation is not yet complete  we do not anticipate it will have a material impact on the company s retained earnings at the time of adoption 

table of contents in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements  fas 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of fas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
impact of inflation the company believes that over the past three years inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure the company has million of variable rate debt outstanding at december  and expects to use its variable rate credit facilities during and beyond to fund acquisitions and cash flow needs 
assuming interest rate volatility in the future is similar to what has been seen in recent years  the company does not anticipate that short term changes in interest rates will materially affect its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
a increase in short term interest rates would add of interest cost annually based on the variable rate debt outstanding at december  foreign exchange exposure the company has foreign operations that expose it to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated to us dollars 
since changes in translation risk are reported as adjustments to stockholders equity  a change in foreign exchange rates would not have material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows
