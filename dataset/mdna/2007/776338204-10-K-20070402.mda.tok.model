required contributions in and are currently projected to be about  and  respectively 
future actual earnings results on the plan s assets and actuarial gains and losses will affect future required contribution amounts

critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require that certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
management uses its best judgment in valuing these estimates and may  as warranted  solicit external professional advice 
estimates are based on current facts and circumstances  prior experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates  affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions relating to the collectibility of accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounting for sales incentives the company records sales incentives as a reduction of sales in the statements of operations 
sales incentives include rebates  consideration and allowances given to retailers for space in their stores slotting fees  consideration and allowances given to obtain favorable display positions in the retailer s stores and other promotional activity 
the company records these promotional incentives in the period during which the related product is shipped to the customer  or when the expense is incurred 
estimated sales incentives are calculated and recorded at the time related sales are made and are based primarily on historical rates and consideration of recent promotional activities 
we review the assumptions and adjust the allowances quarterly 
the financial statements could be materially impacted if the actual promotion costs fluctuate from the standard rate 
the allowances are classified as a reduction of accounts receivable 
revenue recognition net sales are recognized by ronson consumer products on the date of shipment of the product to domestic customers and on the date title for the goods has been transferred on shipments to foreign customers  prior to which an arrangement exists  the price is fixed  and it has been determined that collectibility is reasonably assured 
net sales at ronson aviation are recognized on the date of delivery of the product or service to customers 
for aircraft  this occurs at the time the title for the aircraft has been transferred and the sales proceeds received 
for aircraft fueling  repairs and other aircraft services  delivery occurs only after an arrangement exists  the price is fixed  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
inventory valuations inventories are valued at lower of cost or market determined by the average cost method 
management regularly reviews inventory for salability and establishes obsolescence reserves to absorb estimated lower market values 
on an annual basis  the company takes a physical inventory verifying the units on hand and comparing its perpetual records to physical counts 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances are present  the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
in the event the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
other loss accruals the company has a number of other potential loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims  product liability claims  and litigation costs 
establishing accruals for these matters required management s estimate and judgment with regard to maximum risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization 
as a result  these estimates are often developed with the company s counsel  or other appropriate advisors  and are based on management s current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances 
certain loss exposures  such as the company s potential liability for environmental costs at the former property of prometcor now discontinued  can only be estimated as a range of potential costs 
because of uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of these issues or the possibility of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  additional charges related to these issues could be required in the future 
pension plans the valuation of our pension plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuation of expenses  assets and liabilities 
these assumptions include discount rates  investment returns  and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used in our pension reporting are reviewed annually by management and the company s independent actuary and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they accurately account for our future pension obligations 
changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on pension expenses and related funding requirements 
accounting for income taxes the company assesses the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets by considering future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made

in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin requires that the company recognize the impact of a tax position in the company s financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin are effective as of the beginning of the company s fiscal year  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
the company does not expect that fin will have a material effect on the company s consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in prevailing market interest rates affecting the return on its investments  but does not consider this interest rate market risk exposure to be material to its financial condition or results of operations 
the company invests primarily in highly liquid debt instruments with strong credit ratings and very short term less than days maturities 
the carrying amount of these investments approximates fair value 
all of the company s short term debt  at december  carries a variable rate of interest  and  therefore  the carrying value of the short term debt approximates fair value 
the company s outstanding long term debt as of december   consisted of indebtedness in the amount of  with a fixed rate of interest which is not subject to change based upon changes in prevailing market interest rates 
of the long term debt with fixed interest rates  the  mortgage loan carries a fixed rate of 
based on the company s average borrowings with variable interest rates during and assuming a one percentage point change in average interest rates  it is estimated that the company s interest expense during would have increased or decreased by approximately  the company is also exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to its investment in its canadian subsidiary  ronson canada and because approximately of its consolidated net sales were in canada 
as of december   the company s net investment in ronson canada was approximately  because the company s foreign currency exchange exposure is limited to one relatively stable currency and the relatively small size of its net investment in ronson canada  the company does not consider this foreign currency exchange exposure to be material to its financial condition and results of operations 
the cumulative effect of translating balance sheet accounts from the canadian dollars into the us dollars at the current exchange rate is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company  due to the nature of its operations  is also exposed to changes in the prices of fuels 
in the years ended december  and  the company s cost of fuels included in its consumer products and its cost of aircraft fuel totaled approximately  and  respectively  or approximately of cost of sales in each of the years ended december  and the prices of the fuels fluctuate more or less in conjunction with oil prices 
an increase or decrease of in the average cost of the company s fuels would have increased or decreased the company s cost of sales by approximately  in cost of fuels also impacts the cost of various other components used in the company s products 
increases in the price of fuels  to the extent the company is not able to increase the prices of its products to its customers  could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
under its current policies  the company does not use derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices or equity prices
