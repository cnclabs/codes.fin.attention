business segments our business segments are waste and energy services  which is comprised of covanta energy s domestic and international operations  and other services  which is comprised of the holding company and insurance subsidiaries operations 
our waste and energy services segment is substantially larger than our other services segment 
each of these segments is described below 
additional information about our business segments is contained in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business segments and in note organization and summary of significant accounting policies and note business segments of the notes 

table of contents waste and energy services business our strategic acquisitions of covanta energy and arc holdings have made us a leader in the waste and energy services markets 
we acquired covanta energy in connection with covanta energy s emergence from chapter proceedings 
on march   the bankruptcy court confirmed covanta energy s proposed plans of reorganization and on march   we acquired of covanta energy s equity for approximately million 
we acquired arc holdings on june  by purchasing of the issued and outstanding shares of arc holdings capital stock 
we paid approximately million in cash and transaction costs and assumed arc holdings consolidated net debt of billion at june  billion of consolidated indebtedness net of billion of cash and restricted funds held in trust 
we financed both acquisitions through a combination of debt and equity financings 
the equity component of each financing was effected through rights offerings to our shareholders 
see note acquisitions and dispositions of the notes for a detailed description of the financings associated with these acquisitions 
energy from waste projects the fundamental purpose of our energy from waste projects is to provide waste disposal services  typically to municipal clients who sponsor the projects 
the electricity or steam generated is generally sold to local utilities or industrial customers  and most of the resulting revenues reduce the overall cost of waste disposal services to the municipal clients 
these projects are capable of providing waste disposal services and generating electricity or steam  if properly operated and maintained  for several decades 
generally  we provide these waste disposal services and sell the electricity and steam generated under long term contracts  which expire on various dates between and many of our service contracts may be renewed for varying periods of time  at the option of the municipal client 
we receive revenue in the form of fees pursuant to the service or waste contracts  and in some cases  energy purchase agreements  at facilities we own or operate 
transriver  one of our subsidiaries  markets waste disposal services to third parties predominantly to efficiently utilize that portion of the waste disposal capacity of our energy from waste projects which is not dedicated to municipal clients 
we currently operate energy from waste projects in states  identified below under domestic project summaries 
most of our operating energy from waste projects were developed and structured contractually as part of competitive procurement processes conducted by municipal entities 
as a result  many of these projects have common features 
however  each service agreement is different to reflect the specific needs and concerns of a client community  applicable regulatory requirements and other factors 
the following describes features generally common to these agreements  as well as important distinctions among them we design the facility  help to arrange for financing and then we either construct and equip the facility on a fixed price and schedule basis  or we undertake an alternative role  such as construction management  if that better meets the goals of our municipal client 
financing for the domestic energy from waste projects we own is generally accomplished through tax exempt and taxable revenue bonds issued by or on behalf of the client community 
for these facilities  the bond issuer loans the bond proceeds to us to pay for facility construction and to fund a debt service reserve for the project  which is generally sufficient to pay principal and interest for one year 
project related debt is included as project debt and the debt service reserves are included as restricted funds held in trust in our consolidated financial statements 
generally  project debt is secured by the revenues pledged under the respective indentures and is collateralized by the facility and the contracts and other assets of our project subsidiary 

table of contents following construction and during operations  we receive revenue from two primary sources fees we receive for operating projects or for processing waste received  and payments we receive for electricity and or steam we sell 
we have energy from waste projects at which we receive a fixed fee which escalates over time pursuant to contractual indices which we refer to as having a service fee structure 
we also have energy from waste projects at which we receive a per ton fee under contracts for processing waste  which we refer to as having a tip fee structure 
at our tip fee projects  we contract on both a long term and short term basis to utilize project disposal capacity  and as such we have a greater exposure to waste market price fluctuation  as well as a greater exposure to project operating disruptions that may cause us to reduce waste acceptance 
at projects we own where a service fee structure exists  a portion of the revenue we receive represents payments by the client community of debt service on project debt  which we pass along to a bond trustee for payment to bondholders of principal and interest when due 
we record  as income on our consolidated financial statements  the portion of these payments representing principal on our project debt 
these payments will continue until cash in project debt service reserves is sufficient to pay all remaining debt service payments 
we generally sell the output from our projects pursuant to long term contracts to local utilities 
where a service fee structure exists  our client community usually retains a portion generally of the energy revenues generated and pays the balance to us 
where tip fee structures exist  we retain of the energy revenues 
at three of our projects  we sell energy output under short term contracts or on a spot basis into the regional electricity grid 
at our tip fee projects  we generally have a greater exposure to energy market price fluctuation  as well as a greater exposure to project operating performance 
we agree to operate the facility and meet minimum waste processing capacity and efficiency standards  energy production levels and environmental standards 
failure to meet these requirements or satisfy the other material terms of our agreement unless the failure is caused by our client community or by events beyond our control  may result in liquidated damages charged to us or  if the breach is substantial  continuing and unremedied  termination of the applicable agreement 
in the case of such a termination  we may owe material damages  including amounts necessary to discharge project indebtedness 
at three publicly owned facilities we operate  our client community may terminate the operating contract under limited circumstances but without cause 
the client community generally must deliver minimum quantities of municipal solid waste to the facility on a put or pay basis and is obligated to pay a fee for its disposal 
a put or pay commitment means that the client community promises to deliver a stated quantity of waste and pay an agreed amount for its disposal 
even if the client community delivers less than the full amount of waste promised  it must pay the contractual fee 
where a service fee structure exists  portions of the service fee escalate to reflect indices for inflation 
in many cases the client community must also pay for other costs  such as insurance  taxes  and transportation and disposal of the ash residue to the disposal site 
generally  expenses resulting from the delivery of unacceptable and hazardous waste on the site are also borne by the client community 
in addition  the contracts generally require the client community to pay increased expenses and capital costs resulting from unforeseen circumstances  subject to specified limits 
covanta energy and certain of its subsidiaries have issued performance guarantees to our client communities and  in some cases other parties  which guarantee that our operating subsidiaries will perform in accordance with contractual terms including  where required  the payment of damages 
such contractual damages could be material  and in circumstances where one or more subsidiary s contract has been terminated for its default  such damages could include amounts sufficient to repay project debt 
for facilities owned by client communities and operated by our subsidiaries  covanta energy s potential maximum liability as of december  associated with the repayment of project debt on such facilities was approximately billion in aggregate 
if covanta energy must perform under one or more of such guarantees  its liability for damages upon contract termination would be reduced by funds held in trust and proceeds from sales of the facilities securing the project debt and is presently not estimable 
to date  covanta energy has not incurred material liabilities under such performance guarantees 

table of contents our service and waste disposal agreements  as well as our energy contracts  expire at various times 
the extent to which any such expiration will affect us will depend upon a variety of factors  including whether we own the project  market conditions then prevailing  and whether the municipal client exercises options it may have to extend the contract term 
as our contracts expire we will become subject to greater market risk in maintaining and enhancing our revenues 
as service agreements at municipally owned facilities expire  we intend to seek to enter into renewal or replacement contracts to operate such facilities 
we also will seek to bid competitively in the market for additional contracts to operate other facilities as similar contracts of other vendors expire 
as our service and waste disposal agreements at facilities we own or lease begin to expire  we intend to seek replacement or additional contracts  and because project debt on these facilities will be paid off at such time  we expect to be able to offer rates that will attract sufficient quantities of waste while providing acceptable revenues to us 
at facilities we own  the expiration of existing energy contracts will require us to sell our output either into the local electricity grid at prevailing rates or pursuant to new contracts 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to enter into such renewals  replacement or additional contracts  or that the terms available in the market at the time will be favorable 
to date  we have been successful in extending our existing contracts to operate energy from waste facilities owned by municipal clients where market conditions and other factors make it attractive for both us and our municipal clients to do so 
we have entered into extensions both in the context of expansions of facilities see discussion below regarding our lee county  florida and hillsborough county  florida projects  or other negotiated extensions such as at our lancaster county  pennsylvania and hennepin county  minnesota projects 
the extent to which additional extensions will be attractive to us and to our municipal clients who own their projects will depend upon the market and other factors noted above 
however  we do not believe that either our success or lack of success in entering into additional negotiated extensions to operate such facilities will have a material impact on our cash flow and profitability 
see item a 
risk factors covanta energy may face increased risk of market influences on its domestic revenues after its contracts expire 
other waste related businesses transriver provides waste procurement services to our waste disposal and transfer facilities which have available capacity to receive waste 
in doing so  transriver seeks to maximize our revenue  and ensures that our facilities are being utilized most efficiently  taking into account maintenance schedules and operating restrictions that may exist from time to time at each facility 
transriver also provides management and marketing of ferrous and non ferrous metals recovered from energy from waste operations  as well as services related to non hazardous special waste destruction and residue management for our energy from waste projects 
our waste related business also includes the operations of five transfer stations and two landfills in the northeast united states  which we utilize to supplement and manage more efficiently the fuel and ash disposal requirements at our energy from waste operations 
renewable energy projects we also engage domestically in developing  owning and or operating renewable energy production facilities utilizing a variety of energy sources including water hydroelectric  waste wood biomass and landfill gas 
we sell the electrical output from each facility  with one exception  to local utilities 
we derive our revenues from the renewable energy production facilities primarily from the sale of energy and capacity under energy contracts 
the facilities and locations are identified below under domestic project summaries 
hydroelectric we own a equity interest in two run of river hydroelectric facilities which have a combined gross generating capacity of megawatts mw 
both facilities are located in the state of washington and both sell energy and capacity to puget sound energy under long term energy contracts 
we provide operation and maintenance services at one of the facilities under a cost plus fixed fee agreement 

table of contents waste wood we own three wood fired generation facilities and a interest in a partnership which owns a fourth wood fired generation facility  all of which are located in northern california 
fuel for the facilities is procured from local sources  primarily through short term supply agreements 
the price of the fuel varies depending on the time of the year  supply and price of energy 
these projects have a combined gross generating capacity of mw and sell energy and capacity to pacific gas electric company under energy contracts that expire between and landfill gas we own and operate four landfill gas projects located in california which produce electricity by burning methane gas produced in landfills 
one of these projects  located in san diego  was expanded in  doubling its capacity 
a fifth landfill gas project located in california and a sixth landfill gas project located in maryland were closed in the four remaining projects have a total gross generating capacity of mw and sell energy to various california utilities 
upon the expiration of the energy contracts  we expect that these projects will enter into new power off take arrangements or will be shut down 
water project we designed  built and now operate and maintain a million gallon per day mgd potable water treatment facility and associated transmission and pumping equipment in alabama 
under a long term contract with a public utility authority  we receive a fixed fee plus pass through costs for delivering processed water to a municipal water distribution system

under contracts with the connecticut resource recovery authority  we operate only the boilers and turbines for this facility 
with respect to this project  we have entered into agreements to expand waste processing capacity from  tpd to  tpd and to increase gross electricity capacity from mw to mw 
the agreements will also extend the contract term from to see hillsborough county  florida discussion below 
owned by a limited partnership in which the limited partners are not affiliated with covanta energy 
with respect to this project  we have entered into agreements to expand waste processing capacity from  tpd to  tpd and to increase gross electricity capacity from mw to mw 
the agreements will also extend the contract term from to construction of the expansion is scheduled to be complete during on december   we acquired all limited partnership interests held by unaffiliated entities in our subsidiary covanta onondaga limited partnership 
we have a ownership interest in these projects 
domestic business development in our domestic business development efforts  we encounter competition from other companies in pursuing opportunities in the waste disposal and energy markets 
with the new credit facilities  we will have greater flexibility to pursue such opportunities by investing in the business and making acquisitions 
our business is capital intensive because it is based upon building and operating municipal solid waste processing and energy generating projects 
in order to provide meaningful growth through development  we must be able to invest our funds  obtain equity and or debt financing  and provide support to our operating subsidiaries 
our domestic project development has recently concentrated on working with our client communities to expand existing energy from waste project capacities 
we are pursuing additional project expansion opportunities  contract extension opportunities  acquisition opportunities  and opportunities in businesses ancillary to our existing business  such as additional waste transfer  transportation  processing and landfill businesses 
our development efforts regarding project expansions  contract extensions and new contracts are described below 

table of contents hillsborough county  florida we designed  constructed and now operate and maintain this  tpd mass burn energy from waste facility located in and owned by hillsborough county 
due to the growth in the amount of municipal solid waste generated in hillsborough county  hillsborough county informed us of its desire to expand the facility s waste processing and electricity generation capacities  a possibility contemplated by the original contract between covanta energy and hillsborough county 
in august  covanta energy and hillsborough county entered into agreements to implement this expansion  and to extend the agreement under which covanta energy operates the facility  which would otherwise expire in  through environmental and other project related permits have been secured and the expansion construction commenced on december  lee county  florida we designed  constructed and now operate and maintain this  tpd mass burn energy from waste facility located in and owned by lee county 
due to the growth in the amount of municipal solid waste generated in lee county  lee county informed us of its desire to engage us to manage the expansion of the facility s waste processing and electricity generation capacities  a possibility contemplated by the original contract between covanta energy and lee county 
as part of the agreement to implement this expansion  covanta energy received a long term operating contract extension expiring in contracts for construction of the expansion and contracts for operation and maintenance of the expanded facility have been executed by the parties 
the principal environmental permit for the expansion has been received and construction of the expansion has commenced 
completion of the expansion  and commencement of the operation of the expanded project  is expected during harrisburg  pennsylvania in december  we discussed with officials of the city of harrisburg and the harrisburg authority the authority a potential transaction to purchase  lease or operate  on a long term basis  the authority s tpd energy from waste facility located in harrisburg  pennsylvania 
the facility has been experiencing certain operating difficulties following significant capital improvements undertaken by another company on the authority s behalf 
a subsidiary of covanta energy has entered into an interim agreement to operate and maintain the facility through march  as the authority s contractor 
based upon the understanding we will obtain in the course of operating and maintaining the facility during this period  we expect to provide the authority with a proposal regarding a long term relationship 
international waste and energy services business we conduct our international energy business through our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates 
the largest element of our international waste and energy services business is our ownership in and operation of a mw gross pulverized coal fired electric generating facility in the philippines 
we also have interests in other fossil fuel generating projects in bangladesh  china  india and the philippines  an energy from waste project in italy and two small hydroelectric projects in costa rica 
in general  these projects provide cash returns primarily from equity distributions and  to a lesser extent  operating fees 
the projects sell the electricity and steam they generate under long term contracts or market concessions to utilities  governmental agencies providing power distribution  creditworthy industrial users  or local governmental units 
in select cases  such sales of electricity and steam may be provided under short term arrangements as well 
we presently have interests in international power projects with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately mw gross with our portion of the ownership in these facilities representing approximately mw 
in addition to our headquarters in fairfield  new jersey  our international business is facilitated through field offices in shanghai  china  chennai  india  manila  philippines  birmingham  england  and bangkok  thailand 
general approach to international projects in developing our international business  we have employed the same general approach to projects as is described above with respect to domestic projects 
we intend to seek to develop or participate in additional 
table of contents international projects  particularly energy from waste projects where the regulatory or market environment is attractive 
for information related to the revenues and identifiable assets of the international business  see note business segments of the notes 
the ownership and operation of facilities in foreign countries entails significant political and financial uncertainties that typically are not encountered in such activities in the united states as described in item a 
risk factors exposure to international economic and political factors may materially and adversely affect our international businesses 
many of the countries in which we currently operate are lesser developed countries or developing countries where the political  social and economic conditions are typically less stable than in the united states 
the financial condition and creditworthiness of the potential purchasers of power and services we provide or of the suppliers of fuel for projects in these countries may not be as strong as those of similar entities in developed countries 
the obligations of the purchasers under our energy contracts  the service recipients under our related service agreements and the suppliers under our fuel supply agreements generally are not guaranteed by any host country or other creditworthy governmental agency 
when a project is developed  we undertake a credit analysis of the proposed power purchaser or fuel supplier and to the extent appropriate and achievable within the commercial parameters of a project  require such entities to provide financial instruments  such as letters of credit or arrangements regarding the escrowing of receivables 
we have typically sought to negotiate long term contracts for the supply of fuel with creditworthy and reliable suppliers 
however  the reliability of fuel deliveries may be compromised by one or more of several factors that may be more acute or may occur more frequently in developing countries than in developed countries  including a lack of sufficient infrastructure to support deliveries under all circumstances  bureaucratic delays in the import  transportation and storage of fuel in the host country  customs and tariff disputes  and local or regional unrest or political instability 
in most of the foreign projects in which we participate  we have sought  to the extent practicable  to shift the consequences of interruptions in the delivery of fuel whether due to the fault of the fuel supplier or due to reasons beyond the fuel supplier s control to the electricity purchaser or service recipient by securing a suspension of the project s operating responsibilities under the applicable agreements and an extension of our operating concession under such agreements 
in some instances  we require the energy purchaser or service recipient to continue to make payments of fixed costs if such interruptions occur 
in order to mitigate the effect of short term interruptions in the supply of fuel  we have also endeavored to provide on site storage of fuel in sufficient quantities to address such interruptions 
payment for services that we provide will often be made in whole or in part in the domestic currencies of the host countries 
local governments generally do not assure conversion of such currencies into us dollars  which may be subject to limitations in the currency markets  as well as restrictions of the host country 
in addition  fluctuations in the value of such currencies against the value of the us dollar may cause our participation in such projects to yield less return than expected 
transfer of earnings  capital and profits in any form beyond the borders of the host country may be subject to special taxes or limitations imposed by host country laws 
we have sought to participate in projects where the host country has allowed the convertibility of its currency into us dollars and repatriation of earnings  capital and profits subject to compliance with local regulatory requirements 
in most cases  components of project costs incurred or funded in us dollars are recovered without risk of currency fluctuation through negotiated contractual adjustments to the price charged for electricity or service provided 
this contractual structure may cause the cost in local currency to the project s power purchaser or service recipient to rise from time to time in excess of local inflation  and consequently there is risk in such situations that such power purchaser or service recipient will  at least in the near term  be less able or willing to pay for the project s power or service 
we have sought to manage and mitigate these risks through all appropriate means  including political and financial analysis of the host countries and the key participants in each project  guarantees of relevant agreements with creditworthy entities  political risk and other forms of insurance  participation by united states and or international development finance institutions in the financing of projects  and joint ventures with other companies to pursue the development  financing and construction of these projects 
we determine which mitigation measures to apply based on our ability to balance the risks presented  the availability of such measures and their cost 

table of contents in addition  we have generally participated in projects which provide services that are treated as a matter of national or key economic importance by the laws and politics of the host country 
therefore  there is a risk that the assets constituting the facilities of these projects could be temporarily or permanently expropriated or nationalized by a host country  made subject to local or national control or be subject to unfavorable legislative action  regulatory decisions or changes in taxation 
in certain cases  covanta energy and certain of its subsidiaries have issued guarantees on behalf of our international operating subsidiaries with respect to contractual obligations to operate certain international power projects and one energy from waste project 
the potential damages we may owe under such arrangements may be material 
depending upon the circumstances giving rise to such damages  the contractual terms of the applicable contracts  and the contract counterparty s choice of remedy at the time a claim against a guarantee is made  the amounts owed pursuant to one or more of such guarantees could be greater than our then available sources of funds 
to date  we have not incurred any material liabilities under such guarantees on international projects 
our international power projects are identified below under international project summaries 
the following describes the important features of these projects  by fuel type energy from waste we own a equity interest in an mw mass burn energy from waste project at trezzo sull adda in the lombardy region of italy which burns up to metric tons per day of municipal solid waste 
the remainder of the equity in the project is held by a subsidiary of falck spa and the municipality of trezzo sull adda 
the project is operated by ambiente srl  an italian special purpose limited liability company of which we own 
the solid waste supply for the project comes from municipalities and privately owned waste haulers under long term contracts 
the electrical output from the trezzo project is sold at governmentally established preferential rates under a long term purchase contract to italy s state owned grid operator  gestore della rete di trasmissione nazionale spa hydroelectric we operate two hydroelectric facilities in costa rica through an operating subsidiary pursuant to long term contracts 
we also have a nominal equity investment in each project 
the electric output from both of these facilities is sold to instituto costarricense de electricidad  a costa rica national electric utility 
coal a partnership  in which we hold a equity interest  owns a mw gross coal fired electric power generation facility located in mauban  quezon province  the philippines quezon 
the remaining equity interests are held by an affiliate of international generating company  an affiliate of general electric capital corporation  and an entity owned by the original project developer 
the quezon project sells electricity to the manila electric company meralco  the largest electric distribution company in the philippines  which serves the area surrounding and including metropolitan manila 
under an energy contract expiring in  meralco is obligated to take or pay for stated minimum annual quantities of electricity at an all in price which consists of capacity  operating  energy  transmission and other fees adjusted for inflation  fuel cost and foreign exchange fluctuations 
the quezon project has entered into two coal supply contracts expiring in and under these supply contracts  the cost of coal is determined using a base energy price adjusted to fluctuations of specified international benchmark prices 
our wholly owned subsidiary  covanta philippines operating  inc  operates the project under a long term agreement with the quezon project and we have obtained political risk insurance for our equity investment in this project 
project management continues to negotiate with meralco with respect to proposed amendments to the contract to modify certain commercial terms and to resolve issues relating to the project s performance during its first year of operation 
resolution of these issues is not expected to materially adversely affect the quezon project or the ownership interest in it 

table of contents we also have majority equity interests in two coal fired cogeneration facilities in different provinces in the people s republic of china 
the project entity  in which we hold a majority interest  operates these projects 
during  we sold our interest in a third coal fired project in china 
parties holding minority positions in the projects include a private company  a local government enterprise and affiliates of the local municipal government 
while the steam produced at each of the projects is intended to be sold under long term contracts to the industrial hosts  in practice  steam has been sold on either a short term basis to local industries or the industrial hosts  in each case at varying rates and quantities 
in both cases  the electric power is sold at an average grid rate to subsidiaries of the provincial power bureaus 
natural gas we hold a equity interest in a barge mounted mw gross diesel natural gas fired electric power generation facility located near haripur  bangladesh 
the remaining equity interests are held by an affiliate of globaleq asia holdings limited and an affiliate of wartsila north america  inc the electrical output of the project is sold to the bangladesh power development board bpdb pursuant to an energy contract with minimum energy off take provisions at an all in price divided into a fuel component and an other component 
the fuel component reimburses the fuel cost incurred by the project up to a specified heat rate 
the other component consists of a pre determined base rate which is adjusted for the actual load factor and foreign exchange fluctuations 
the bpdb also supplies all of the project s natural gas requirements at a pre determined base cost adjusted to fluctuations on actual landed cost of the fuel in bangladesh 
the government of bangladesh guarantees the bpdb s contractual obligations 
we operate the project under a long term agreement with the project company and we have obtained political risk insurance for our equity interest in this project 
diesel heavy fuel oil we hold majority equity interests in two mw gross heavy fuel oil fired electric power generation facilities in india 
we hold a equity interest in the first project the samalpatti project  which is located near samalpatti  in the state of tamil nadu 
the remaining equity interests in the salmalpatti project are held by affiliates of shapoorji pallonji infrastructure capital co 
ltd 
and by wartsila india power investment  llc 
we hold a equity interest in the second project the madurai project  which is located at samayanallur  also in the state of tamil nadu 
the remaining equity interest in the madurai project is held by an indian company controlled by the original project developer 
both projects sell their electrical output to the tamil nadu electricity board tneb pursuant to long term agreements with a full pass through all in pricing structure that takes into account specified heat rates  operation and maintenance costs  and equity returns 
tneb s obligations are guaranteed by the government of the state of tamil nadu 
indian oil companies supply the oil requirements of both projects through year fuel supply agreements based on market prices 
we operate both projects through subsidiaries under long term agreements with the project companies 
disputing several contractual provisions  tneb has failed to pay the full amount due under the energy contracts for both the samalpatti and madurai projects 
to date  tneb has paid the undisputed portion of its payment obligations approximately of total billings representing each project s operating costs  fuel costs  debt service and some equity return 
similar to many indian state electricity boards  tneb has also failed to fund an escrow account or post a letter of credit required under the project energy contracts  which failure constitutes a default under the project finance documents 
project lenders for both projects have either granted periodic waivers of such default or potential default and or otherwise approved scheduled equity distributions 
neither such default nor potential default in the project financing arrangements constitutes a default under covanta energy s financing arrangements 
it is possible that the issue of the escrow account and or letter of credit requirement will be resolved as part of the overall negotiation with tneb with respect to the disputed receivables in both projects 
we also own a minority interest in a mw heavy fuel oil fired electric power generation facility located in the province of mindoro  the philippines the island power project that has a long term power sales contract

table of contents international business development as with our domestic business  the new credit facilities afford greater flexibility to invest in and grow our international business 
we are pursuing international waste and or energy business opportunities  particularly in markets where the market demand  regulatory environment or other factors encourage technologies such as energy from waste in order to reduce dependence on landfilling  such as italy  the united kingdom  china or island nations where landfilling is a less desirable disposal option 
china joint venture on february   we entered into agreements relating to the subscription for a equity interest in chongqing sanfeng environmental industry co  ltd 
sanfeng 
sanfeng  a company located in chongqing municipality  china  is engaged in the business of owning and operating energy from waste projects and providing design and engineering  procurement and construction services for energy from waste facilities in china 
sanfeng currently owns minority equity interests in two  metric tons per day  mw mass burn energy from waste projects 
energy from waste facility design and engineering services are provided by sanfeng using technology under license from martin gmbh fur umwelt und energietechnik 
our investment in sanfeng is subject to various regulatory and other conditions precedent and is expected to be completed during the second quarter of upon completion of our investment  sanfeng will be converted into a sino foreign equity joint venture under chinese law in which sanfeng s current shareholder  chongqing iron steel company group limited  will hold the remaining equity interest 
we intend to expand the business of the joint venture company through the development of additional mass burn energy from waste projects in china in which covanta intends to co invest with the joint venture company 
other services business discussion of other services business the operations of the holding company prior to the acquisition of covanta energy on march   primarily included general and administrative expenses related to officer salaries  legal and other professional fees and insurance 
subsequent to the acquisition of covanta energy  these expenses are reimbursed by covanta energy under an administrative services agreement 
the holding company operations also include income earned on its investments 
insurance business following the acquisitions of covanta energy and arc holdings  the relative contribution of our insurance business to our cash flow and its relative percentage of our financial obligations were significantly reduced 
consequently  our insurance business neither contributes materially to our cash flow nor imposes material financial obligations on us 
our insurance business continues to represent an important element of our structure in that our net operating loss carryforwards nols were primarily generated through the operations of former subsidiaries of dind 
our ability to utilize that portion of the nols will depend upon the continued inclusion of our insurance business in our consolidated federal income tax return

our insurance operations are conducted through wholly owned subsidiaries  principally naicc 
naicc has historically managed its business across four principal lines of business non standard private passenger automobile  commercial automobile  workers compensation  and property and casualty 
as of december   naicc was engaged in writing exclusively non standard private passenger automobile primarily in california 
naicc intends to also engage in the specialty surety business in order to expand its business incrementally 
our insurance businesses have succeeded in reducing their loss ratio by adjusting rate filings  tightening underwriting criteria  exiting unprofitable lines of business and focusing on writing more profitable lines of 
table of contents business through its arrangements with third parties providing marketing  underwriting and administration services 
such third parties do not have rate making authority or authority to enter into reinsurance arrangements 
such third parties are paid flat commission on new and renewal policies written and they participate in an incentive compensation arrangement dictated solely by underwriting results 
insurers admitted in california are required to obtain approval  from the california department of insurance  of rates and or forms prior to their use 
many of the other states in which naicc is authorized to conduct business have similar requirements 
rates and policy forms are developed by naicc and filed with the regulators in each of the relevant states  depending upon each state s requirements 
naicc relies upon its own  as well as industry  experience in establishing rates 
non standard automobile liability risks relate to those segments of the driving public which generally are not considered preferred business  such as drivers with a record of prior accidents or driving violations  drivers involved in particular occupations or driving certain types of vehicles  or those drivers whose policies have not been renewed or whose policies have been declined by another insurance company 
generally  in order to address the associated higher risk of non standard private automobile insurance  premium rates are higher than standard premium rates while policy limits are lower than typical policy limits 
policyholder selection is governed by underwriting guidelines established by naicc 
naicc believes that it is able to achieve underwriting success through refinement of various risk profiles  thereby dividing the non standard market into more defined segments which can be adequately priced 
additionally  traditional lower policy limits lend themselves to quicker claims processing allowing naicc to respond more quickly to changing loss trends  by revising underlying underwriting guidelines and class and rate filings accordingly 
naicc maintains reserves with respect to net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae  representing the estimated indemnity cost and expense necessary to cover the ultimate net cost of investigating and settling claims 
such estimates are based upon estimates for reported losses  historical company experience of losses reported by reinsured companies for insurance assumed and actuarial estimates based upon historical company and industry experience for development of reported and unreported claims incurred but not reported 
any changes in estimates of ultimate liability are reflected in current operating results 
inflation is assumed  along with other factors  in estimating future claim costs and related liabilities 
naicc does not discount any of its loss reserves 
naicc believes its provisions for unpaid losses and lae are adequate to cover the net cost of losses and loss expenses incurred to date  and that it satisfies all reserve based capital requirements imposed under applicable insurance regulations 
in its normal course of business  naicc typically reinsures a portion of its exposure with other insurance companies so as to effectively limit its maximum loss arising out of any one occurrence 
contracts of reinsurance do not legally discharge the original insurer from its primary liability 
estimated reinsurance receivables arising from these contracts of reinsurance are reported separately as assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
markets  competition and business conditions general business conditions our business can be adversely affected by general economic conditions  war  inflation  adverse competitive conditions  governmental restrictions and controls  changes in laws  natural disasters  energy shortages  fuel costs  weather  the adverse financial condition of customers and suppliers  various technological changes and other factors over which we have no control 
we expect in the foreseeable future that competition for new contracts and projects will be intense in all markets in which we conduct or intend to conduct businesses  and our businesses will be subject to a variety of competitive  regulatory and market influences 
with respect to our waste related businesses  including our energy from waste and transriver businesses  we compete in the waste disposal market  which is highly competitive 
while we currently process for disposal over 
table of contents of the municipal solid waste in the united states  the market for waste disposal is almost entirely price driven and is greatly influenced by economic factors within regional waste sheds 
these factors include regional population and overall waste production rates  the number of other waste disposal sites including principally landfills and transfer stations in existence or in the planning or permitting process  the available disposal capacity in terms of tons of waste per day that can be offered by other regional disposal sites  and the availability and cost of transportation options rail  intermodal  trucking to provide access to more distant disposal sites  thereby affecting the size of the waste shed itself 
in the waste disposal market  disposal service providers seek to obtain waste supplies to their facilities by competing on disposal price usually on a per ton basis with other disposal service providers 
at all but eight of our energy from waste facilities  we typically do not compete in this market because we do not have the contractual right to solicit waste 
at these facilities  the client community is responsible for obtaining the waste  if necessary by competing on price to obtain the tons of waste it has contractually promised to deliver to us 
at eight of our energy from waste facilities and at our transriver businesses  we are responsible for obtaining material amounts of waste supply  and therefore  actively compete in these markets to enter into spot  medium and long term contracts 
all of these energy from waste projects are in densely populated areas  with high waste generation rates and numerous large and small participants in the regional market 
certain of our competitors in these markets are vertically integrated waste companies which include waste collection operations  and thus have the ability to control supplies of waste which may restrict our ability to offer disposal services at attractive prices 
our business does not include waste collection operations 
our waste operations are largely concentrated in the northeastern united states 
see item a 
risk factors our waste operations are concentrated in one region  and expose us to regional economic or market declines for additional information concerning this geographic concentration 
if a long term contract expires and is not renewed or extended by a client community  our percentage of contracted disposal capacity will decrease  and we will need to compete in the regional market for waste disposal 
at that point  we will compete on price with landfills  transfer stations  other energy from waste facilities and other waste disposal technologies that are then offering disposal service in the region 
see discussion under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview contract duration for additional information concerning the expiration of existing contracts 
we may develop or acquire  ourselves or jointly with others  additional waste or energy projects or businesses 
if we were to do so in a competitive procurement  we would face competition in the selection process from other companies  some of which may have greater financial resources 
if we were selected  the amount of market competition we would thereafter face would depend upon the extent to which the capacity at any such project would be committed under contract 
if we were to develop or acquire additional projects or businesses not in the context of a competitive procurement  we would face competition in the regional market and compete on price with landfills  transfer stations  other energy from waste facilities  other energy producers and other waste disposal or energy generation technologies that are then offering service in the region 
with respect to our electricity sales from our energy from waste projects and independent power projects  we primarily sell our output pursuant to long term contracts 
accordingly  we generally do not sell our output into markets where we must compete on price 
as these contracts expire  we will participate in such markets if we are unable to enter into new or renewed long term contracts 
see discussion under item a 
risk factors covanta energy may face increased risk of market influences on its domestic revenues after its contracts expire for additional information concerning the expiration of existing contracts 
once a contract is awarded or a project is financed and constructed  our business can be impacted by a variety of risk factors which can affect profitability over the life of a project 
some of these risks are at least partially within our control  such as successful operation in compliance with laws and the presence or absence of labor difficulties or 
table of contents disturbances 
other risk factors are largely out of our control and may have an adverse impact on a project over a long term 
see item a 
risk factors for more information on these types of risks 
technology  research and development we have the exclusive right to market the proprietary mass burn technology of martin gmbh fur umwelt und energietechnik  referred to herein as martin in the united states  canada  mexico  bermuda and certain caribbean countries the territory 
the principal feature of the martin technology is the reverse reciprocating stoker grate upon which the waste is burned 
the patent for the basic stoker grate technology used in the martin technology has expired and there are various other expired and unexpired patents relating to the martin technology 
we believe that it is martin s know how and worldwide reputation in the energy from waste industry  and our know how in designing  constructing and operating energy from waste facilities  rather than the use of patented technology  that is important to our competitive position in the energy from waste industry in the united states 
we do not believe that the expiration of the remaining patents covering portions of the martin technology will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or competitive position 
since  our rights to the martin technology have been provided pursuant to a cooperation agreement with martin which gives us exclusive rights to market  and distribute parts and equipment for the martin technology in the territory 
martin is obligated to assist us in installing  operating and maintaining facilities incorporating the martin technology 
the cooperation agreement renews automatically each year unless notice of termination is given  in which case  the cooperation agreement would terminate ten years after such notice 
any termination would not affect our rights to design  construct  operate  maintain or repair energy from waste facilities for which contracts have been entered into or proposals made prior to the date of termination 
we believe that mass burn technology is now the predominant technology used for the combustion of municipal solid waste 
we believe that the martin technology is a proven and reliable mass burn technology  and that our association with martin has created significant name recognition and value for our domestic energy from waste business 
through facility acquisitions  we own and or operate some energy from waste facilities which utilize additional technologies  including non martin mass burn technologies  and refuse derived fuel technologies which include pre combustion waste processing not required with a mass burn design 
as we continue our efforts to develop and or acquire additional energy from waste projects internationally  we will consider mass burn and other technologies  including martin systems  which best fit the needs of the local environment of a particular project 
we believe energy from waste technologies offer an environmentally superior solution to waste disposal and energy challenges faced by leaders around the world  and that our efforts to expand our domestic and international businesses  will be enhanced by the development of additional technologies in such fields as emission controls  residue disposal  alternative waste treatment processes  and combustion controls 
during  we advanced our research and development efforts in these areas  and have developed  along with martin  a proprietary waste combustion process that we expect will reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides 
we also developed a proprietary process to improve the handling of the residue from our energy from waste facilities 
we intend to maintain a focus in the years ahead on research and development of technologies in these and other areas we believe will enhance our competitive position and complement our business 
regulation of business our waste and energy services business and our insurance business are both highly regulated 
regulations affecting our domestic waste and energy services business environmental regulations our business activities in the united states are pervasively regulated pursuant to federal  state and local environmental laws 
federal laws  such as the clean air act and clean water act  and their state counterparts  govern discharges of pollutants to air and water 
other federal  state and local laws comprehensively govern the generation  transportation  storage  treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and also regulate the 
table of contents storage and handling of chemicals and petroleum products such laws and regulations are referred to collectively as the environmental regulatory laws 
other federal  state and local laws  such as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as cercla  and collectively referred to with such other laws as the environmental remediation laws  make us potentially liable on a joint and several basis for any onsite or offsite environmental contamination which may be associated with our activities and the activities at sites 
these include landfills that our subsidiaries have owned  operated or leased or  at which there has been disposal of residue or other waste generated  handled or processed by such subsidiaries 
some state and local laws also impose liabilities for injury to persons or property caused by site contamination 
some service agreements provide for indemnification of operating subsidiaries from certain liabilities 
in addition  other subsidiaries involved in landfill gas projects have access rights to landfill sites pursuant to certain leases that permit the installation  operation and maintenance of landfill gas collection systems 
a portion of these landfill sites have been federally designated superfund sites 
each of these leases provide for indemnification of our subsidiaries from some liabilities associated with these sites 
the environmental regulatory laws require that many permits be obtained before the commencement of construction and operation of any waste  renewable energy or independent power project or water facility  and further require that permits be maintained throughout the operating life of the facility 
we can provide no assurance that all required permits will be issued or re issued  and the process of obtaining such permits can often cause lengthy delays  including delays caused by third party appeals challenging permit issuance 
our failure to meet conditions of these permits or of the environmental regulatory laws can subject us or our operating subsidiaries to regulatory enforcement actions by the appropriate governmental unit  which could include fines  penalties  damages or other sanctions  such as orders requiring certain remedial actions or limiting or prohibiting operation 
see item a 
risk factors compliance with environmental laws could adversely affect our results of operations 
to date  we have not incurred material penalties  been required to incur material capital costs or additional expenses  or been subjected to material restrictions on our operations as a result of violations of environmental regulatory laws or permit requirements 
although our operations are occasionally subject to proceedings and orders pertaining to emissions into the environment and other environmental violations  which may result in fines  penalties  damages or other sanctions  we believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental regulatory laws 
we may be identified  along with other entities  as being among parties potentially responsible for contribution to costs associated with the correction and remediation of environmental conditions at disposal sites subject to cercla and or analogous state environmental remediation laws 
in certain instances  we may be exposed to joint and several liability for remedial action or damages 
our ultimate liability in connection with such environmental claims will depend on many factors  including our volumetric share of waste  the total cost of remediation  and the financial viability of other companies that have also sent waste to a given site and  in the case of divested operations  our contractual arrangement with the purchaser of such operations 
the environmental regulatory laws are subject to revision 
new technology may be required or stricter standards may be established for the control of discharges of air or water pollutants  for storage and handling of petroleum products or chemicals  or for solid or hazardous waste or ash handling and disposal 
thus  as new technology is developed and proven  we may be required to incorporate it into new facilities or major modifications to existing facilities 
this new technology may often be more expensive than the technology we use currently 
on may   the environmental protection agency epa issued revisions to the new source performance standards nsps and emission guidelines eg applicable to new and existing municipal waste combustion mwc units the revised mact rule 
the revised mact rule lowered the emission limits for most of the regulated air pollutants emitted by mwcs 
the general compliance deadline for the revised eg is april   however  the actual compliance date for a particular facility may be earlier depending on the state in which the facility is located 
we anticipate that one existing energy from waste facility  which we operate on behalf of a municipality  will require capital improvements to comply with revised eg  and have initiated discussions with such municipality regarding implementation and its intended financing options 
most existing facilities also will 
table of contents incur increased operating and maintenance costs to meet the revised eg requirements  none of which are expected to be material 
on october   epa issued a final rule to implement the revised national ambient air quality standards for fine particulate matter  or pm pm rule 
unlike the revised mact rule discussed above  the pm rule is not specific to energy from waste facilities  but instead is a nationwide standard for ambient air quality 
the primary impact of the pm rule will be on those counties in certain states that are designated by epa as non attainment with respect to those standards 
epa s pm rule will guide how states achieve compliance with the pm rule  and could result in more stringent regulation of certain energy from waste facility emissions that already are regulated by the revised mact rule 
epa is expected to make non attainment designations by november  however  state plans to meet the pm rule will not be due until april the costs to meet new rules for existing facilities owned by municipal clients generally will be borne by the municipal clients 
for projects we own or lease  the municipal clients generally have the obligation to fund such capital improvements  and at certain of our projects we may be required to fund a portion of the related costs 
in certain cases  we are required to fund the full cost of capital improvements 
we believe that most costs incurred to meet the revised mact rule and pm rule at facilities we operate may be recovered from municipal clients and other users of our facilities through increased fees permitted to be charged under applicable contracts 
the environmental remediation laws prohibit disposal of regulated hazardous waste at our municipal solid waste facilities 
the service agreements recognize the potential for inadvertent and improper deliveries of hazardous waste and specify procedures for dealing with hazardous waste that is delivered to a facility 
although under some service agreements  we are responsible for some costs related to hazardous waste deliveries  to date no operating subsidiary has incurred material hazardous waste disposal costs 
during  increased public and political debate occurred over the need for additional regulation of greenhouse gasses principally carbon dioxide co and methane as a contributor to global warming  that could in the future affect our business 
while the political discussion has not been aimed specifically at the waste or energy from waste businesses  regulatory initiatives developed to date are broad in scope and are generally designed to promote renewable energy  development of a certified inventory and ultimately reduction of greenhouse gas emissions 
most of these initiatives are at the state or regional levels  but with debate currently underway in congress  federal regulation is possible as well  and may need to be reconciled with state and regional efforts 
we believe that energy from waste is a mitigating technology that provides net reductions in greenhouse gas emissions  because it avoids co emissions from fossil fuel power plants and methane from landfills 
for policymakers at the local level  who make decisions on waste disposal alternatives  we believe using energy from waste instead of landfilling will result in significantly lower net greenhouse gas emissions  while also introducing more control over the cost and supply of local electrical power 
some regulatory initiatives exist in regions where we have projects 
for example  during  a group of seven northeastern states  including connecticut  new jersey and new york  acting through the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi  issued a model rule to implement reductions in greenhouse gas emissions 
the model rule establishes a cap and trade program with a market based emissions trading system aimed at reducing emissions of co  and may be followed in individual state rulemakings 
the model rule establishes an initial cap for regional co emissions equivalent to levels  with incremental reductions below those levels after to date  rggi is focused on fossil fuel fired electric generators  however  we continue to monitor developments with respect to state implementation of rggi and intend to participate in rulemaking 
also during  california enacted the california global warming solutions act of ab 
ab requires annual reporting of greenhouse gas emissions for sources deemed significant by the state air resources board arb and sets emission limits to cut california s emissions to levels by during  we joined the california climate action registry  certifying our greenhouse gas emissions from our california facilities 
as a member  we will participate in the evolving regulatory process by which the arb will implement the 
table of contents requirements of ab until the arb issues its regulations  it is not possible to predict with certainty the impact of ab on our california facilities 
energy regulation our businesses are subject to the provisions of federal  state and local energy laws applicable to the development  ownership and operation of domestic facilities 
pursuant to the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has promulgated regulations that exempt qualifying facilities cogeneration facilities and other facilities making use of non fossil fuel power sources such as waste  which meet certain size  ownership and other applicable requirements  referred to as qfs from compliance with certain provisions of the federal power act fpa  the public utility holding company act of puhca repealed effective february  and certain state laws regulating the rates charged by  or the financial and organizational activities of  electric utilities 
purpa was enacted in to encourage the development of  among other things  requiring electric utilities to offer to purchase electric energy from and sell electric energy to qfs at nondiscriminatory rates 
the exemptions afforded by purpa to qfs from regulation under the fpa and most aspects of state electric utility regulation are of great importance to us and our competitors in the energy from waste and independent power industries 
except with respect to energy from waste facilities with a net power production capacity in excess of mw where rates are set by the ferc  state public utility commissions must approve the rates  and in some instances other contract terms  by which public utilities purchase electric power from qfs 
the energy policy act of  passed in august  makes certain changes to the federal energy laws applicable to our business  the most significant of which are described below the energy policy act repealed puhca  effective february  which eliminated any remote risk we might have faced by being subject to puhca s extensive  utility type regulation and reporting requirements imposed on holding companies under puhca 
the repeal of puhca has been balanced with increased ferc authority to cause record keeping and conduct investigations under appropriate circumstances 
as a company that owns only qfs  exempt wholesale generators and or foreign utility companies  we are generally exempt from such record keeping and such investigations 
the energy policy act amends certain provisions of purpa 
it terminated purpa s mandatory purchase and sale obligation imposed on utilities for the benefit of qfs where the qf has nondiscriminatory access to competitive power markets 
existing contracts are grandfathered  but many expansions  renewals and new development projects must rely on competitive power markets  rather than purpa protections  in establishing and maintaining their viability in most geographic regions in which we operate 
the energy policy act also eliminates the utility ownership limitation for qfs 
in october  ferc issued final regulations under the energy policy act providing for  among other things  a rebuttable presumption that the competitive power market requirement is satisfied in regions served by midwest independent transmission system operator  pjm interconnection  llc  iso new england  inc  new york independent system operator and the electric reliability council of texas  and qfs with a capacity greater than mw have non discriminatory access to those markets 
as to qfs with a capacity at or below mw  the regulations provide for a rebuttable presumption that such qfs do not have non discriminatory access to any market 
this change might have the effect of making some transactions and development projects more likely to be consummated 
this could result in greater utility ownership of qfs than previously was the case due to purpa and puhca restrictions and considerations 
if these transactions and development projects occur in the areas of energy from waste  other renewable energy and independent power  it could serve to increase competition with our businesses by bringing greater utility participation to these markets 
the energy policy act extends or establishes certain renewable energy incentives and tax credits which might be helpful to expand our businesses or for new development 

table of contents regulations affecting our international business we presently have ownership and operating interests in electric generating projects outside the united states 
most countries have expansive systems for the regulation of the power business 
these generally include provisions relating to ownership  licensing  rate setting and financing of generation and transmission facilities 
we aim to provide energy generating and other infrastructure through environmentally protective project designs  regardless of the location of a particular project 
this approach is consistent with the stringent environmental requirements of multilateral financing institutions  such as the world bank  and also with our experience in domestic energy from waste projects  where environmentally protective facility design and performance is required 
compliance with environmental standards comparable to those of the united states may be conditions to the provision of credit by multilateral banking agencies  as well as other lenders or credit providers 
the laws of other countries also may require regulation of emissions into the environment  and provide governmental entities with the authority to impose sanctions for violations  although these requirements are generally different from those applicable in the united states 
see item a 
risk factors exposure to international economic and political factors may materially and adversely affect our international businesses and compliance with environmental laws could adversely affect our results of operations 
as with domestic project development  we can provide no assurance that all required permits will be issued  and the process can often cause lengthy delays 
certain international markets in which we compete have recently adopted regulatory or policy frameworks that encourage energy from waste as an important component of waste management planning and practice 
for example  china currently has a favorable regulatory environment for the development of energy from waste projects 
the national plan issued by the ministry of construction calls for an increase in municipal solid waste incineration from estimate to by energy from waste is designated by the chinese central government as an encouraged industry  and china accordingly has various promotional policies in place to promote energy from waste projects including value added tax refunds  prioritized commercial bank loans  state subsidies for loan interest  and a guaranteed subsidized price for the sale of electricity 
similarly  the european union has adopted regulations which require member countries to reduce utilization of and reliance upon landfill disposal 
the legislation emanating from the european union is primarily in the form of directives 
these are not directly applicable within the member states 
rather  they need enabling domestic legislation to implement them  which results in significant variance between the legislative schemes introduced by member states 
certain directives notably affect the regulation of energy from waste facilities across the european union 
these include directive ec concerning integrated pollution prevention and control known as the ppc directive which governs the emissions to air  land and water from certain large industrial installations  directive ec concerning the landfill of waste known as the landfill directive which imposes operational and technical controls on landfills and restricts  on a reducing scale to the year  the amount of biodegradable municipal waste which member states may dispose of to landfill  and directive ec on the incineration of waste known as the waste incineration directive or wid  which imposes limits on emissions to air on the incineration and co incineration of waste 
in response to these directives  member countries have begun to implement such measures as imposing incremental fees on landfill disposal and providing rate subsidies for energy generated at energy from waste projects 
regulations affecting our insurance business insurance companies are subject to insurance laws and regulations established by the states in which they transact business 
the agencies established pursuant to these state laws have broad administrative and supervisory powers relating to the granting and revocation of licenses to transact business  regulation of trade practices  establishment of guaranty associations  licensing of agents  approval of policy forms  premium rate filing requirements  reserve requirements  the form and content of required regulatory financial statements  capital and surplus requirements and the maximum concentrations of certain classes of investments 
most states also have enacted legislation regulating insurance holding company systems  including acquisitions  extraordinary dividends  the terms of affiliate transactions and other related matters 
we and our insurance subsidiaries have registered as holding companies pursuant to such legislation in california and montana  and routinely report to other 
table of contents jurisdictions 
the national association of insurance commissioners has formed committees and appointed advisory groups to study and formulate regulatory proposals on such diverse issues as the use of surplus debentures  accounting for reinsurance transactions and the adoption of risk based capital requirements 
it is not possible to predict the impact of future state and federal regulation on the operations of our insurance business 
naicc is an insurance company domiciled in the state of california and is regulated by the california department of insurance for the benefit of policyholders 
the california insurance code does not permit the payment of an extraordinary shareholder dividend without prior approval from the california insurance commissioner 
dividends are considered extraordinary if they exceed the greater of net income or of statutory surplus as of the preceding december st 
for the foreseeable future  naicc is not expected to have sufficient accumulated earned surplus to pay dividends 
a model for determining the risk based capital requirements  referred to as rbc requirements  for property and casualty insurance companies was adopted in december the model generally assesses the assets at risk and underwriting operations and determines policyholders surplus levels necessary to support such activity 
naicc has calculated its rbc requirement under the most recent rbc requirement model and  as of december   it had capital in excess of the regulatory authorized control level 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  full time employees worldwide  of which a majority are employed in the united states 
of our employees in the united states  approximately are represented by organized labor 
currently  we are party to seven collective bargaining agreements three expire in  two expire in and two expire in we consider relations with our employees to be good and do not anticipate any significant labor disputes in executive officers a list of our executive officers and their business experience follows

item a 
risk factors the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot be certain that our nols will continue to be available to offset tax liability 
our nols will expire in various amounts  if not used  between and the internal revenue service irs has not audited any of our tax returns for any of the years during the carryforward period including those returns for the years in which the losses giving rise to the nols were reported 
we cannot assure you that we would prevail if the irs were to challenge the availability of the nols 
if the irs were successful in challenging our nols  all or some portion of the nols would not be available to offset our future consolidated taxable income 
as of december   we estimated that we had approximately million of nols 
in order to utilize the nols  we must generate consolidated taxable income which can offset such carryforwards 
the nols are also utilized by income from certain grantor trusts that were established as part of the reorganization in of certain of our subsidiaries engaged in the insurance business and are administered by state regulatory agencies 
as a result of uncertainty regarding the administration of certain of these grantor trusts during june  we reduced the aggregate amount of our available nols by million 
during or at the conclusion of the administration of these grantor trusts  taxable income could result  which could utilize a portion of our nols and  in turn  could accelerate the date on which we may be otherwise obligated to pay incremental cash taxes 
in addition  if our existing insurance business were to require capital infusions from us in order to meet certain regulatory capital requirements  and we were to fail to provide such capital  some or all of our subsidiaries comprising our insurance business could enter insurance insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings 
in such event  such subsidiaries may no longer be included in our consolidated tax return  and a portion  which could constitute a significant portion  of our remaining nols may no longer be available to us 
in such event  there may be a significant inclusion of taxable income in our federal consolidated income tax return 

table of contents our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our indebtedness 
the level of our consolidated indebtedness could have significant consequences on our future operations  including making it difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our outstanding indebtedness  including the debentures  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on indebtedness under the new credit facilities  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  and increasing our vulnerability to  changes in our business  the industries in which we operate and the general economy  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged 
any of the above listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our consolidated debt  and the price of our common stock 
we cannot assure you that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to service our indebtedness 
our ability to meet our obligations under our indebtedness depends on our subsidiaries ability to generate cash and our ability to receive dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries in the future 
this  in turn  is subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including the following the continued operation and maintenance of our facilities  consistent with historical performance levels  maintenance or enhancement of revenue from renewals or replacement of existing contracts and from new contracts to expand existing facilities or operate additional facilities  market conditions affecting waste disposal and energy pricing  as well as competition from other companies for contract renewals  expansions and additional contracts  particularly after our existing contracts expire  and general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations  or that future borrowings will be available to us under the new credit facilities or otherwise  in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under our outstanding indebtedness and to fund other liquidity needs 
if our subsidiaries are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations  we may need to refinance or restructure our debt  sell assets  reduce or delay capital investments  or seek to raise additional capital 
if we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives  we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under our outstanding indebtedness  and which could have a material and adverse affect on our financial condition 
covanta energy s debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 
covanta energy s new credit facilities contain  and any of our other future debt agreements may contain  operating and financial restrictions and covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on covanta energy and certain of its subsidiaries and require covanta energy to meet certain financial tests 
complying with these covenant restrictions may have a negative impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition by limiting covanta energy s ability to engage in certain transactions or activities  including incurring additional indebtedness or issuing guarantees  in excess of specified amounts  
table of contents creating liens  in excess of specified amounts  making certain investments  in excess of specified amounts  entering into transactions with our affiliates  selling certain assets  in excess of specified amounts  making cash distributions or paying dividends to us  in excess of specified amounts  redeeming capital stock or making other restricted payments to us  in excess of specified amounts  and merging or consolidating with any person 
covanta energy s ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance  which will be subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including prevailing economic conditions 
as a result of these covenants  our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing  if needed  may be restricted  and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us  or in declaring and paying dividends to our stockholders 
in addition  the failure to comply with these covenants in covanta energy s new credit facilities could result in a default thereunder and a default under the debentures 
upon the occurrence of such an event of default  the lenders under covanta energy s new credit facilities could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such agreement  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
if the lenders accelerate the payment of the indebtedness under covanta energy s new credit facilities  we cannot assure you that the assets securing such indebtedness would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness  including the debentures  and which could have a material and adverse affect on our financial condition 
operation of our facilities and the expansion of facilities involve significant risks 
the operation of our waste and energy facilities and the construction of new or expanded facilities involve many risks  including the inaccuracy of our assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of anticipated revenues  supply interruptions  the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes  difficulty or inability to find suitable replacement parts for equipment  the unavailability of sufficient quantities of waste  decreases in the fees for solid waste disposal  decreases in the demand or market prices for recovered ferrous or non ferrous metal  disruption in the transmission of electricity generated  permitting and other regulatory issues  license revocation and changes in legal requirements  labor disputes and work stoppages  unforeseen engineering and environmental problems  unanticipated cost overruns  weather interferences  catastrophic events including fires  explosions  earthquakes  droughts and acts of terrorism  the exercise of the power of eminent domain  and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency 
we cannot predict the impact of these risks on our business or operations 
these risks  if they were to occur  could prevent covanta energy and its subsidiaries from meeting their obligations under their operating contracts 

table of contents the rapid growth of our operations could strain our resources and cause our business to suffer 
we have experienced rapid growth and intend to further grow our business 
this growth has placed  and potential future growth will continue to place  a strain on our management systems  infrastructure and resources 
our ability to successfully offer services and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
we expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial controls  reporting systems and procedures 
we will also need to expand  train and manage our workforce worldwide 
furthermore  we expect that we will be required to manage an increasing number of relationships with various customers and other third parties 
failure to expand in any of the foregoing areas efficiently and effectively could interfere with the growth of our business as a whole 
development  construction and operation of new projects may not commence as scheduled  or at all 
the development and construction of new waste and energy facilities involves many risks including siting  permitting  financing and construction delays and expenses  start up problems  the breakdown of equipment and performance below expected levels of output and efficiency 
new facilities have no operating history and may employ recently developed technology and equipment 
our businesses maintain insurance to protect against risks relating to the construction of new projects  however  such insurance may not be adequate to cover lost revenues or increased expenses 
as a result  a new facility may be unable to fund principal and interest payments under its debt service obligations or may operate at a loss 
in certain situations  if a facility fails to achieve commercial operation  at certain levels or at all  termination rights in the agreements governing the facility s financing may be triggered  rendering all of the facility s debt immediately due and payable 
as a result  the facility may be rendered insolvent and we may lose our interest in the facility 
our efforts to grow our business will require us to incur significant costs in business development  often over extended periods of time  with no guarantee of success 
our efforts to grow our waste and energy business will depend in part on how successful we are in developing new projects and expanding existing projects 
the development period for each project may occur over several years  during which we incur substantial expenses relating to siting  design  permitting  community relations  financing and professional fees associated with all of the foregoing 
not all of our development efforts will be successful  and we may decide to cease developing a project for a variety of reasons 
if the cessation of our development efforts were to occur at an advanced stage of development  we may have incurred a material amount of expenses for which we will realize no return 
a failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates and to complete acquisitions could have an adverse effect on our business strategy and growth plans 
as part of our business strategy  we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses 
although we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities  we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  to obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms to fund acquisitions  or to complete acquisitions 
our insurance and contractual protections may not always cover lost revenues  increased expenses or liquidated damages payments 
although our businesses maintain insurance  obtain warranties from vendors  require contractors to meet certain performance levels and  in some cases  pass risks we cannot control to the service recipient or output purchaser  the proceeds of such insurance  warranties  performance guarantees or risk sharing arrangements may not be adequate to cover lost revenues  increased expenses or liquidated damages payments 
performance reductions could materially and adversely affect us and our projects may operate at lower levels than expected 
most service agreements for our energy from waste facilities provide for limitations on damages and cross indemnities among the parties for damages that such parties may incur in connection with their performance under 
table of contents the service agreement 
in most cases  such contractual provisions excuse our businesses from performance obligations to the extent affected by uncontrollable circumstances and provide for service fee adjustments if uncontrollable circumstances increase our costs 
we cannot assure you that these provisions will prevent our businesses from incurring losses upon the occurrence of uncontrollable circumstances or that if our businesses were to incur such losses they would continue to be able to service their debt 
covanta energy and certain of its subsidiaries have issued or are party to performance guarantees and related contractual obligations associated with its energy from waste  renewable energy  independent power and water facilities 
with respect to its domestic businesses  covanta energy and certain of its subsidiaries have issued guarantees to its municipal clients and other parties that covanta energy s subsidiaries will perform in accordance with contractual terms  including  where required  the payment of damages or other obligations 
the obligations guaranteed will depend upon the contract involved 
many of covanta energy s subsidiaries have contracts to operate and maintain energy from waste facilities 
in these contracts  the subsidiary typically commits to operate and maintain the facility in compliance with legal requirements  to accept minimum amounts of solid waste  to generate a minimum amount of electricity per ton of waste  and to pay damages to contract counterparties under specified circumstances  including those where the operating subsidiary s contract has been terminated for default 
any contractual damages or other obligations incurred by covanta energy and certain of its subsidiaries could be material  and in circumstances where one or more subsidiary s contract has been terminated for its default  such damages could include amounts sufficient to repay project debt 
additionally  damages payable under such guarantees on covanta energy s owned energy from waste facilities could expose covanta energy to recourse liability on project debt 
covanta energy and certain of its subsidiaries which have issued these guarantees may not have sufficient sources of cash to pay such damages or other obligations 
we cannot assure you that covanta energy and such subsidiaries will be able to continue to avoid incurring material payment obligations under such guarantees or that  if covanta energy did incur such obligations  that covanta energy would have the cash resources to pay them 
our businesses generate their revenue primarily under long term contracts and must avoid defaults under those contracts in order to service their debt and avoid material liability to contract counterparties 
covanta energy s subsidiaries must satisfy performance and other obligations under contracts governing energy from waste facilities 
these contracts typically require covanta energy s subsidiaries to meet certain performance criteria relating to amounts of waste processed  energy generation rates per ton of waste processed  residue quantity and environmental standards 
the failure of covanta energy s subsidiaries to satisfy these criteria may subject them to termination of their respective operating contracts 
if such a termination were to occur  covanta energy s subsidiaries would lose the cash flow related to the projects and incur material termination damage liability  which may be guaranteed by covanta energy or certain of its subsidiaries 
in circumstances where the contract of one or more subsidiaries has been terminated due to the default of one of covanta energy s subsidiaries they may not have sufficient sources of cash to pay such damages 
we cannot assure you that covanta energy s subsidiaries will be able to continue to perform their respective obligations under such contracts in order to avoid such contract terminations  or damages related to any such contract termination  or that if they could not avoid such terminations that they would have the cash resources to pay amounts that may then become due 
covanta energy and certain of its subsidiaries have provided guarantees and support in connection with its subsidiaries projects 
covanta energy and certain of its subsidiaries are obligated to guarantee or provide financial support for its subsidiaries projects in one or more of the following forms support agreements in connection with service or operating agreement related obligations  direct guarantees of certain debt relating to three of its facilities  contingent obligations to pay lease payment installments in connection with three of its facilities  contingent credit support for damages arising from performance failures  environmental indemnities  and 
table of contents contingent capital and credit support to finance costs  in most cases in connection with a corresponding increase in service fees  relating to uncontrollable circumstances 
many of these contingent obligations cannot readily be quantified  but  if we were required to provide this support  it may be material to our cash flow and financial condition 
covanta energy may face increased risk of market influences on its domestic revenues after its contracts expire 
covanta energy s contracts to operate energy from waste projects expire on various dates between and  and our contracts to sell energy output generally expire when the project s operating contract expires 
expiration of these contracts will subject covanta energy to greater market risk in entering into new or replacement contracts at pricing levels which will generate comparable or enhanced revenues 
as its operating contracts at municipally owned projects approach expiration  covanta energy will seek to enter into renewal or replacement contracts to continue operating such projects 
however  we cannot assure you that covanta energy will be able to enter into renewal or replacement contracts on terms favorable to it  or at all 
covanta energy will seek to bid competitively for additional contracts to operate other facilities as similar contracts of other vendors expire 
the expiration of existing energy sales contracts  if not renewed  will require covanta energy to sell project energy output either into the electricity grid or pursuant to new contracts 
at some of our facilities  market conditions may allow covanta energy to effect extensions of existing operating contracts along with facility expansions 
such extensions and expansions are currently being considered at a limited number of our facilities in conjunction with covanta energy s clients 
if covanta energy is unable to reach agreement with its municipal clients on the terms under which they would implement such extensions and expansions  or if the implementation of these extensions  including renewals and replacement contracts  and expansions are materially delayed  this may adversely affect our cash flow and profitability 
we cannot assure you that covanta energy will be able to enter into such contracts or that the terms available in the market at the time will be favorable to it 
our businesses depend on performance by third parties under contractual arrangements 
our waste and energy businesses depend on a limited number of third parties to  among other things  purchase the electric and steam energy produced by our facilities  and supply and deliver the waste and other goods and services necessary for the operation of our energy facilities 
the viability of our facilities depends significantly upon the performance by third parties in accordance with long term contracts  and such performance depends on factors which may be beyond our control 
if those third parties do not perform their obligations  or are excused from performing their obligations because of nonperformance by our waste and energy businesses or other parties to the contracts  or due to force majeure events or changes in laws or regulations  our businesses may not be able to secure alternate arrangements on substantially the same terms  if at all  for the services provided under the contracts 
in addition  the bankruptcy or insolvency of a participant or third party in our facilities could result in nonpayment or nonperformance of that party s obligations to us 
concentration of suppliers and customers may expose us to heightened financial exposure 
our waste and energy businesses often rely on single suppliers and single customers at our facilities  exposing such facilities to financial risks if any supplier or customer should fail to perform its obligations 
for example  our businesses often rely on a single supplier to provide waste  fuel  water and other services required to operate a facility and on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility s output 
in most cases our businesses have long term agreements with such suppliers and customers in order to mitigate the risk of supply interruption 
the financial performance of these facilities depends on such customers and suppliers continuing to perform their obligations under their long term agreements 
a facility s financial results could be materially and adversely affected if any one customer or supplier fails to fulfill its contractual obligations and we are unable to find other customers or suppliers to produce the same level of profitability 
we cannot assure you that such performance failures by third parties will not occur  or that if they do occur  such failures will not adversely affect the cash flows or profitability of our businesses 

table of contents in addition  for their energy from waste facilities  our subsidiaries rely on their municipal clients as a source not only of waste for fuel but also of revenue from the fees for disposal services our subsidiaries provide 
because contracts of our subsidiaries with their municipal clients are generally long term  our subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the credit quality of one or more of their municipal clients were to decline materially 
our business is subject to pricing fluctuations caused by the waste disposal and energy markets 
while our businesses sell the majority of their waste disposal capacity and energy output pursuant to long term contracts  a material portion of this capacity and output is subject to market price fluctuation 
consequently  our operating results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in waste disposal and energy prices 
our waste operations are concentrated in one region  and expose us to regional economic or market declines 
the majority of our waste disposal facilities are located in the northeastern united states  primarily along the washington  dc to boston  massachusetts corridor 
adverse economic developments in this region could affect regional waste generation rates and demand for waste disposal services provided by us 
adverse market developments caused by additional waste disposal capacity in this region could adversely affect waste disposal pricing 
either of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and cash generation 
some of our energy contracts involve greater risk of exposure to performance levels which could result in materially lower revenues 
eight of our energy from waste facilities receive of the energy revenues they generate 
as a result  if we are unable to operate these facilities at their historical performance levels for any reason  our revenues from energy sales could materially decrease 
exposure to international economic and political factors may materially and adversely affect our international businesses 
our international operations expose us to legal  tax  currency  inflation  convertibility and repatriation risks  as well as potential constraints on the development and operation of potential business  any of which can limit the benefits to us of a foreign project 
our projected cash distributions from existing international facilities come from facilities located in countries with sovereign ratings below investment grade 
the financing  development and operation of projects outside the united states can entail significant political and financial risks  which vary by country  including changes in law or regulations  changes in electricity tariffs  changes in foreign tax laws and regulations  changes in united states federal  state and local laws  including tax laws  related to foreign operations  compliance with united states federal  state and local foreign corrupt practices laws  changes in government policies or personnel  changes in general economic conditions affecting each country  including conditions in financial markets  changes in labor relations in operations outside the united states  political  economic or military instability and civil unrest  
table of contents expropriation and confiscation of assets and facilities  and credit quality of entities that purchase our power 
the legal and financial environment in foreign countries in which we currently own assets or projects could also make it more difficult for us to enforce our rights under agreements relating to such projects 
any or all of the risks identified above with respect to our international projects could adversely affect our revenue and cash generation 
as a result  these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
exposure to foreign currency fluctuations may affect our costs of operations 
we have sought to participate in projects where the host country has allowed the convertibility of its currency into us dollars and repatriation of earnings  capital and profits subject to compliance with local regulatory requirements 
in most cases  components of project costs incurred or funded in the currency of the united states are recovered with limited exposure to currency fluctuations through negotiated contractual adjustments to the price charged for electricity or service provided 
this contractual structure may cause the cost in local currency to the project s power purchaser or service recipient to rise from time to time in excess of local inflation 
as a result  there is a risk in such situations that such power purchaser or service recipient will  at least in the near term  be less able or willing to pay for the project s power or service 
exposure to fuel supply prices may affect our costs and results of operations for our international projects 
changes in the market prices and availability of fuel supplies to generate electricity may increase our cost of producing power  which could adversely impact our energy businesses profitability and financial performance 
the market prices and availability of fuel supplies for some of our international facilities fluctuate 
any price increase  delivery disruption or reduction in the availability of such supplies could affect our ability to operate the facilities and impair their cash flow and profitability 
we may be subject to further exposure if any of our future international operations are concentrated in facilities using fuel types subject to fluctuating market prices and availability 
we may not be successful in our efforts to mitigate our exposure to supply and price swings 
our inability to obtain resources for operations may adversely affect our ability to effectively compete 
our energy from waste facilities depend on solid waste for fuel  which provides a source of revenue 
for most of our facilities  the prices we charge for disposal of solid waste are fixed under long term contracts and the supply is guaranteed by sponsoring municipalities 
however  for some of our energy from waste facilities  the availability of solid waste to us  as well as the tipping fee that we must charge to attract solid waste to our facilities  depends upon competition from a number of sources such as other energy from waste facilities  landfills and transfer stations competing for waste in the market area 
in addition  we may need to obtain waste on a competitive basis as our long term contracts expire at our owned facilities 
there has been consolidation and there may be further consolidation in the solid waste industry which would reduce the number of solid waste collectors or haulers that are competing for disposal facilities or enable such collectors or haulers to use wholesale purchasing to negotiate favorable below market disposal rates 
the consolidation in the solid waste industry has resulted in companies with vertically integrated collection activities and disposal facilities 
such consolidation may result in economies of scale for those companies as well as the use of disposal capacity at facilities owned by such companies or by affiliated companies 
such activities can affect both the availability of waste to us for disposal at some of our energy from waste facilities and market pricing 
compliance with environmental laws could adversely affect our results of operations 
costs of compliance with federal  state and local existing and future environmental regulations could adversely affect our cash flow and profitability 
our waste and energy businesses are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal  state and local authorities  primarily relating to air  waste including residual ash from combustion and water 
we are required to comply with numerous environmental laws and regulations and to obtain 
table of contents numerous governmental permits in operating our facilities 
our businesses may incur significant additional costs to comply with these requirements 
environmental regulations may also limit our ability to operate our facilities at maximum capacity or at all 
if our businesses fail to comply with these requirements  we could be subject to civil or criminal liability  damages and fines 
existing environmental regulations could be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities  and future changes in environmental laws and regulations could occur 
this may materially increase the amount we must invest to bring our facilities into compliance 
in addition  lawsuits or enforcement actions by federal and or state regulatory agencies may materially increase our costs 
stricter environmental regulation of air emissions  solid waste handling or combustion  residual ash handling and disposal  and waste water discharge could materially affect our cash flow and profitability 
certain environmental laws make us potentially liable on a joint and several basis for the remediation of contamination at or emanating from properties or facilities we currently or formerly owned or operated or properties to which we arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances 
such liability is not limited to the cleanup of contamination we actually caused 
although we seek to obtain indemnities against liabilities relating to historical contamination at the facilities we own or operate  we cannot provide any assurance that we will not incur liability relating to the remediation of contamination  including contamination we did not cause 
our businesses may not be able to obtain or maintain  from time to time  all required environmental regulatory approvals 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain and comply with them  the operation of our facilities could be jeopardized or become subject to additional costs 
energy regulation could adversely affect our revenues and costs of operations 
our waste and energy businesses are subject to extensive energy regulations by federal  state and foreign authorities 
we cannot predict whether the federal  state or foreign governments will modify or adopt new legislation or regulations relating to the solid waste or energy industries 
the economics  including the costs  of operating our facilities may be adversely affected by any changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation or any future inability to comply with existing or future regulations or requirements 
the fpa regulates energy generating companies and their subsidiaries and places constraints on the conduct of their business 
the fpa regulates wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce by public utilities 
under purpa our domestic facilities are exempt from most provisions of the fpa and state rate regulation 
our foreign projects are also exempt from regulation under the fpa 
the energy policy act of enacted comprehensive changes to the domestic energy industry which may affect our businesses 
the energy policy act removed certain regulatory constraints that previously limited the ability of utilities and utility holding companies to invest in certain activities and businesses  which may have the effect over time of increasing competition in energy markets in which we participate 
in addition  the energy policy act includes provisions that may remove some of the benefits provided to non utility electricity generators  like us  after our existing energy sale contracts expire 
as a result  we may face increased competition after such expirations occur 
if our businesses lose existing exemptions under the fpa  the economics and operations of our energy projects could be adversely affected  including as a result of rate regulation by the ferc  with respect to our output of electricity  which could result in lower prices for sales of electricity 
in addition  depending on the terms of the project s power purchase agreement  a loss of our exemptions could allow the power purchaser to cease taking and paying for electricity under existing contracts 
such results could cause the loss of some or all contract revenues or otherwise impair the value of a project and could trigger defaults under provisions of the applicable project contracts and financing agreements 
defaults under such financing agreements could render the underlying debt immediately due and payable 
under such circumstances  we cannot assure you that revenues received  the costs incurred  or both  in connection with the project could be recovered through sales to other purchasers 
failure to obtain regulatory approvals could adversely affect our operations 
our waste and energy businesses are continually in the process of obtaining or renewing federal  state and local approvals required to operate our facilities 
while our businesses currently have all necessary operating approvals  we may not always be able to obtain all required regulatory approvals  and we may not be able to obtain any 
table of contents necessary modifications to existing regulatory approvals or maintain all required regulatory approvals 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain and comply with any required regulatory approvals  the operation of our facilities or the sale of electricity to third parties could be prevented  made subject to additional regulation or subject our businesses to additional costs or a decrease in revenue 
the energy industry is becoming increasingly competitive  and we might not successfully respond to these changes 
we may not be able to respond in a timely or effective manner to the changes resulting in increased competition in the energy industry in both domestic and international markets 
these changes may include deregulation of the electric utility industry in some markets  privatization of the electric utility industry in other markets and increasing competition in all markets 
to the extent competitive pressures increase and the pricing and sale of electricity assumes more characteristics of a commodity business  the economics of our business may come under increasing pressure 
changes in technology may have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
research and development activities are ongoing to provide alternative and more efficient technologies to dispose of waste or produce power 
it is possible that advances in these or other technologies will reduce the cost of waste disposal or power production from these technologies to a level below our costs 
furthermore  increased conservation efforts could reduce the demand for power or reduce the value of our facilities 
any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
our reputation could be adversely affected if opposition to our efforts to grow our business results in adverse publicity or our businesses were to fail to comply with united states or foreign laws or regulations 
with respect to our efforts to renew our contracts and grow our waste and energy business both domestically and internationally  we sometimes experience opposition from advocacy groups or others intended to halt a development effort or other opportunity we may be pursuing 
such opposition is often intended to discourage third parties from doing business with us and may be based on inaccurate  incomplete or inflammatory assertions 
we cannot provide any assurance that our reputation would not be adversely affected as a result of adverse publicity resulting from such opposition 
some of our projects and new business may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically penetrated the economy to a greater extent than in the united states 
it is our policy to comply  and to require our local partners and those with whom we do business to comply  with all applicable anti bribery laws  such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate 
we cannot provide any assurance that our reputation would not be adversely affected if we were reported to be associated with corrupt practices or if we or our local partners failed to comply with such laws 
our controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud 
our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within our companies have been prevented or detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty  and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by an unauthorized override of the controls 
the design of any systems of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
accordingly  because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

table of contents failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on our stock price 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and the rules and regulations promulgated by the securities and exchange commission sec to implement section  we are required to furnish a report by our management to include in our annual report on form k regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
the report includes  among other things  an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
we have in the past discovered  and may potentially in the future discover  areas of internal control over financial reporting which may require improvement 
if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective now or in any future period  or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price

although there are no agreements among sz investments  third avenue and laminar regarding their voting or disposition of shares of our common stock  the level of their combined ownership of shares of our common stock could have the effect of discouraging or impeding an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
further  as a result  these stockholders may continue to have the ability to influence the election or removal of our directors and influence the outcome of matters presented for approval by our stockholders 
circumstances may occur in which the interests of these stockholders could be in conflict with the holders of the debentures 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and debentures could discourage an acquisition by a third party 
provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 
for example  our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without requiring any stockholder approval  and preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal 
these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders 
in addition  certain provisions of the debentures could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us 
upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change  the holders of the debentures will have the right to require us to repurchase their debentures 
we may also be required to issue additional shares upon conversion or provide for conversion based on the acquirer s capital stock in the event of certain fundamental changes 
these possibilities could discourage an acquisition of us 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  and this may make it difficult for holders to resell our common stock when they want or at prices that they find attractive 
the price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange constantly changes 
we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate 
in addition  because the debentures are convertible into our common stock  volatility or depressed prices for our common stock could have a similar effect on the trading price of the debentures 
consequently  there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of an investment in our common stock 

table of contents the market price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include changes in the waste and energy market conditions  quarterly variations in our operating results  our operating results that vary from the expectations of management  securities analysts and investors  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  announcements of strategic developments  significant contracts  acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors  the operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to us  future sales of our equity or equity related securities  changes in the economy and the financial markets  departures of key personnel  changes in governmental regulations  and geopolitical conditions  such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts 
in addition  in recent years  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons often unrelated to their operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating results 
future issuances of our common stock will dilute the ownership interests of stockholders and may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock  or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or equity related securities in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could materially and adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock 
in addition  the conversion of some or all of the debentures will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders 
any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  the existence of the debentures may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the debentures could depress the trading price of our common stock

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview covanta holding corporation is organized as a holding company which conducts all of its operations through subsidiaries which are engaged in the businesses of waste and energy services  and insurance services 
covanta holding corporation s predominant business is the waste and energy services business  however its historical consolidated operations were conducted in the insurance industry prior to the acquisition of covanta energy corporation in march and the acquisition of covanta arc holdings  inc in june the terms we  our  ours  us and company refer to covanta holding corporation and its subsidiaries  the term covanta energy refers to our subsidiary covanta energy corporation and its subsidiaries  the term arc holdings refers to our subsidiary covanta arc holdings  inc and its subsidiaries  the term transriver refers to our subsidiary transriver marketing company  lp  the term cpih refers to our subsidiary covanta power international holdings  inc  and the term naicc refers to our subsidiary national american insurance company of california and its subsidiaries 
we are a leading developer  owner and operator of infrastructure for the conversion of energy from waste  waste disposal and renewable energy production businesses in the united states 
we also engage in the independent power production business outside the united states 
we own or operate energy generation facilities  of which are in the united states and of which are located outside the united states 
our energy generation facilities use a variety of fuels  including municipal solid waste  water hydroelectric  natural gas  coal  wood waste  landfill gas and heavy fuel oil 
we also own or operate several businesses that are associated with our energy from waste business  including a waste procurement business  two landfills  and several waste transfer stations 
we also operate one domestic water treatment facility 
we believe our business offers solutions to public sector leaders around the world in two related elements of critical infrastructure post recycling waste disposal  and energy generation 
we believe the environmental benefits of energy from waste  as an alternative to landfilling  are clear and compelling utilizing energy from waste reduces greenhouse gas emissions  lowers the risk of groundwater contamination  and conserves land 
at the same time  energy from waste generates clean reliable energy from a renewable fuel source  thus reducing dependence on fossil fuels 
as public planners address their needs for more environmentally sensitive waste disposal and energy generation in the years ahead  we believe energy from waste will be an increasingly attractive alternative 
we are focused on providing customers with superior service by operating our existing businesses to historic high standards  generating sufficient cash to meet our liquidity needs  paying down covanta energy s debt  as well as project debt  investing in and growing our business in order to create additional value for stockholders  and seeking acquisition opportunities to expand our operations in the united states and abroad 
maintaining historic facility production levels while effectively managing operating and maintenance expense is important to optimize covanta energy s long term cash generation 
we do not expect to make any cash contributions to covanta energy except in conjunction with certain acquisitions and investments permitted under covanta energy s new credit facilities as described below 
covanta energy may make limited cash distributions to us under the new credit facilities 

table of contents on january   we announced a comprehensive recapitalization plan utilizing a series of equity and debt financings 
subsequent to this announcement  we completed the following transactions the refinancing of covanta energy s debt facilities with new covanta energy debt facilities  comprised of a million revolving credit facility  a million funded letter of credit facility  and a million term loan collectively referred to as the new credit facilities  an underwritten public offering of million shares of our common stock  in which we received proceeds of approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions  an underwritten public offering of approximately million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures the debentures issued by us  from which we received proceeds of approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions  and the repayment  by means of a tender offer  of approximately million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes previously issued by covanta energy s intermediate subsidiaries 
we completed our public offerings of equity and debt  including over allotment options exercised by underwriters  on january  and february   and we closed on the new credit facilities on february  we completed our tender offer for approximately million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes on february  additional information  including material terms and financial statement impacts related to our recapitalization plan  is contained in liquidity and capital resources below 
under the new credit facilities  we will have substantially greater  but not unrestricted  ability to make investments in our business and to take advantage of opportunities to grow our business through investments and acquisitions  both domestically and internationally 
our liquidity is enhanced by the existence of net operating loss carryforwards nols  which predominantly arose from our predecessor insurance entities mission insurance entities  formerly named mission insurance group  inc  which have been in state insolvency proceedings in california and missouri since the late s 
as described below  certain grantor trusts associated with these predecessor insurance entities and the taxable income and loss they generate continue to be included in our consolidated tax group 
our ability to utilize the nols to offset taxable income generated by operations in our waste and energy services segment could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
we had nols estimated to be million for federal income tax purposes as of december  the nols will expire in various amounts from december  through december   if not used 
the amount of nols available to us will be reduced by any taxable income generated by current members of our consolidated tax group  which include the grantor trusts described above 
during or at the conclusion of the administration of these grantor trusts by state insurance regulatory agencies  taxable income could result  which could utilize a portion of our nols and in turn could accelerate the date on which we may be otherwise obligated to pay incremental cash taxes 
while we cannot predict with certainty what amounts  if any  may be includable in our taxable income as a result of the final administration of the trusts  we believe that any such taxable income will not result in a material reduction in available nols 
for additional detail relating to our nols and risks attendant thereto  see note income taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements notes and item a 
risk factors we cannot be certain that our nols will continue to be available to offset tax liability 
our business segments given the significance of the covanta energy and arc holdings acquisitions to our results of operations and financial condition  we decided  during the third quarter of  to combine the previously separate business segments of insurance services and parent only operations into one reportable segment called other services 
therefore  we have two reportable business segments waste and energy services and other services 

table of contents waste and energy services the waste and energy services segment includes our domestic and international businesses 
for all energy from waste projects  we receive revenue from two primary sources fees charged for operating projects or processing waste received and payments for electricity and steam sales 
we also operate  and in some cases have ownership interests in  transfer stations and landfills which generate revenue from waste disposal fees or operating fees 
in addition  we own and in some cases operate  other renewable energy projects in the united states which generate electricity from wood waste  landfill gas  and hydroelectric resources 
the electricity from these projects is sold to utilities 
for these projects  we receive revenue from electricity sales  and in some cases cash from equity distributions 
we also have ownership interests in  and or operate  independent power production facilities in the philippines  china  bangladesh  india  and costa rica  and one energy from waste facility in italy 
the costa rica facilities generate electricity from hydroelectric resources  while the other independent power production facilities generate electricity and steam by combusting coal  natural gas  or heavy fuel oil 
for these projects  we receive revenue from operating fees  electricity and steam sales  and in some cases cash from equity distributions 
contract structures we have energy from waste projects where we charge a fixed fee which escalates over time pursuant to contractual indices we believe are appropriate to reflect price inflation for operation and maintenance services 
we refer to these projects as having a service fee structure 
our contracts at service fee projects provide revenue that does not materially vary based on the amount of waste processed or energy generated and as such is relatively stable for the contract term 
in addition  at most of our service fee projects  the operating subsidiary retains only a fraction of the energy revenues generated  with the balance used to provide a credit to the municipal client against its disposal costs 
therefore  in these projects  the municipal client derives most of the benefit and risk of energy production and changing energy prices 
we also have energy from waste projects where we receive a per ton fee under contracts for processing waste 
we refer to these projects as having a tip fee structure 
at tip fee projects  we generally enter into long term waste disposal contracts for a substantial portion of project disposal capacity and retain all of the energy revenue generated 
the waste disposal and energy revenue from these projects is more dependent upon operating performance and  as such  is subject to greater revenue fluctuation to the extent performance levels fluctuate 
under both structures  our returns are expected to be stable if we do not incur material unexpected operation and maintenance costs or other expenses 
in addition  most of our energy from waste project contracts are structured so that contract counterparties generally bear  or share in  the costs associated with events or circumstances not within our control  such as uninsured force majeure events and changes in legal requirements 
the stability of our domestic revenues and returns could be affected by our ability to continue to enforce these obligations 
also  at some of our energy from waste facilities  commodity price risk is mitigated by passing through commodity costs to contract counterparties 
with respect to domestic and international independent power projects  such structural features generally do not exist because either we operate and maintain such facilities for our own account or we do so on a cost plus basis rather than a fixed fee basis 
at some of our domestic and international independent power projects  our operating subsidiaries purchase fuel in the open markets which exposes us to fuel price risk 
at other plants  fuel costs are contractually included in our electricity revenues  or fuel is provided by our customers 
in some of our international projects  the project entity which in some cases is not our subsidiary has entered into long term fuel purchase contracts that protect the project from changes in fuel prices  provided counterparties to such contracts perform their commitments 
seasonal effects our quarterly operating income from domestic and international operations within the same fiscal year typically differs substantially due to seasonal factors  primarily as a result of the timing of scheduled plant maintenance 

table of contents we typically conduct scheduled maintenance periodically each year  which requires that individual boiler units temporarily cease operations 
during these scheduled maintenance periods  we incur material repair and maintenance expenses and receive less revenue  until the boiler units resume operations 
this scheduled maintenance typically occurs during periods of off peak electric demand in the spring and fall 
the spring scheduled maintenance period is typically more extensive than scheduled maintenance conducted during the fall 
as a result  we typically incur the highest maintenance expense in the first half of the year 
given these factors  we typically experience lower operating income from our projects during the first six months of each year  and higher operating income during the second six months of each year 
contract duration we operate domestic energy from waste projects under long term agreements 
for those projects we own  our contract to sell the project s energy output either electricity or steam generally expires at or after the date when the initial term of our contract to operate or receive waste also expires 
expiration of these contracts will subject us to greater market risk in maintaining and enhancing revenues as we enter into new contracts 
we intend to enter into replacement or additional contracts for waste supplies and will sell our energy output either into the regional electricity grid or pursuant to new contracts 
because project debt on these facilities will be paid off at such time  we believe we will be able to offer disposal services at rates that will attract sufficient quantities of waste and provide acceptable revenues 
for those projects we operate but do not own  prior to the expiration of the initial term of our operating contract  we will seek to enter into renewal or replacement contracts to continue operating such projects 
we will seek to bid competitively in the market for additional contracts to operate other facilities as similar contracts of other vendors expire 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into such renewals  replacement or additional contracts  or that the terms available in the market at the time will be favorable 
for additional information regarding contract expiration dates  see item business 
energy from waste project ownership we operate many publicly owned energy from waste facilities and own and operate many other facilities 
in addition  as a result of acquisitions of additional projects originally owned or operated by other vendors  we operate several projects under a lease structure where a third party lessor owns the project 
regardless of ownership structure  we provide the same service to our municipal clients and customers 
under any of these ownership structures  the municipalities typically borrow funds to pay for the facility construction by issuing bonds 
in a private ownership structure  the municipal entity loans the bond proceeds to the project subsidiary  the facility is recorded as an asset  and the project debt is recorded as a liability  on our consolidated balance sheet 
in a public ownership structure  the municipality would fund the construction costs without loaning the bond proceeds to us 
at all projects where a service fee structure exists regardless of ownership structure  our municipal clients are generally responsible contractually for paying the project debt after construction is complete 
at the publicly owned service fee projects we operate  the municipality pays periodic debt service directly to a trustee under an indenture 
we own projects where a service fee structure exists  and at these projects the municipal client pays debt service as a component of a monthly service fee payment to us 
the debt service payment is retained by a trustee  and is not held or available to us for general use 
at these projects  we record revenue on our consolidated financial statements with respect to debt service both principal and interest on project debt  and interest expense on project debt 
for projects that are owned  all cash held by trustees is recorded as restricted funds held in trust on our consolidated balance sheet 
we own or lease projects where a tip fee structure exists and neither debt service nor lease rent is expressly included in the fee paid to us 
accordingly  we do not record revenue reflecting principal on this project debt or on lease rent 
in most cases  our operating subsidiaries for these projects make equal monthly deposits with their respective project trustees in amounts sufficient for the trustees to pay principal and interest  or lease rent  when due 
the term of our operating contracts with municipal clients generally coincides with the term of the bonds issued to pay for the project construction 
therefore  another important difference between public and private ownership of our energy from waste projects is project ownership after these contracts expire 
in many cases  the municipality has 
table of contents contractual rights not obligations to extend the contract 
if a contract is not extended on a publicly owned project  our role  and our revenue  with respect to that project would cease 
if a contract is not extended on a project that we own  we would be free to enter into new revenue generating contracts for waste supply with the municipality  other municipalities  or private waste haulers and for electricity or steam sales 
we would  in such cases  have no remaining project debt to repay from project revenue  and would be entitled to retain of energy sales revenue 
other factors affecting performance we have historically performed our operating obligations without experiencing material unexpected service interruptions or incurring material increases in costs 
in addition  with respect to many of our contracts at domestic projects  we generally have limited our exposure for risks not within our control 
with respect to projects acquired in the arc holdings acquisition  we have assumed contracts where there is less contractual protection against such risks and more exposure to market influences 
for additional information about such risks and damages that we may owe for unexcused operating performance failures  see item a 
risk factors 
in monitoring and assessing the ongoing operating and financial performance of our businesses  we focus on certain key factors tons of waste processed  electricity and steam sold  and boiler availability 
our ability to meet or exceed historical levels of performance at projects  and our general financial performance  is affected by the following seasonal or long term changes in market prices for waste  energy  or ferrous and non ferrous metals  for projects where we sell into those markets  seasonal  geographic and other variations in the heat content of waste processed  and thereby the amount of waste that can be processed by a energy from waste facility  our ability to avoid unexpected increases in operating and maintenance costs while ensuring that adequate facility maintenance is conducted so that historic levels of operating performance can be sustained  contract counterparties ability to fulfill their obligations  including the ability of our various municipal customers to supply waste in contractually committed amounts  and the availability of alternate or additional sources of waste if excess processing capacity exists at our facilities  and the availability and adequacy of insurance to cover losses from business interruption in the event of casualty or other insured events 
general financial performance at our international projects is affected by the following changes in fuel price for projects in which such costs are not completely passed through to the electricity purchaser through revenue adjustments  or delays in the effectiveness of revenue adjustments  the amounts of electricity actually requested by purchasers of electricity  and whether or when such requests are made  our facilities are then available to deliver such electricity  our ability to avoid unexpected increases in operating and maintenance costs while ensuring that adequate facility maintenance is conducted so that historic levels of operating performance can be sustained  the financial condition and creditworthiness of purchasers of power and services provided by us  fluctuations in the value of the domestic currency against the value of the us dollar for projects in which we are paid in whole or in part in the domestic currency of the host country  and political risks inherent to the international business which could affect both the ability to operate the project in conformance with existing agreements and the repatriation of dividends from the host country 
business development in our domestic business development efforts  we encounter competition from other companies in pursuing opportunities in the waste disposal and energy markets 
with the new credit facilities  we will have greater flexibility to pursue such opportunities by investing in the business  and making acquisitions 

table of contents our business is capital intensive because it is based upon building and operating municipal solid waste processing and energy generating projects 
in order to provide meaningful growth through development  we must be able to invest our funds  obtain equity and or debt financing  and provide support to our operating subsidiaries 
our domestic project development has recently concentrated on working with our client communities to expand existing energy from waste project capacities and  as a result  we have two expansion projects under construction 
we are pursuing additional project expansion opportunities  contract extension opportunities  acquisition opportunities  and opportunities in businesses ancillary to our existing business  such as additional waste transfer  transportation  processing and landfill businesses 
as with our domestic business  the new credit facilities afford greater flexibility to invest in and grow our international business 
we are pursuing international waste and or energy business opportunities  particularly in markets where the market demand  regulatory environment or other factors encourage technologies such as energy from waste in order to reduce dependence on landfilling  such as in italy  the united kingdom  china or island nations where landfilling is a less desirable disposal option 
other services our other services segment is comprised of the holding company and insurance subsidiaries operations 
holding company operations prior to the acquisition of covanta energy on march   primarily included general and administrative expense related to officer salaries  legal and other professional fees and insurance 
subsequent to the acquisition of covanta energy  these expenses have been reimbursed by covanta energy under a corporate services agreement 
the holding company operations also include income earned on its investments 
the operations of our principal insurance subsidiary  naicc  and its subsidiaries  are primarily property and casualty insurance 
based upon the profitability of its insurance lines  naicc has responded to expand  contract or cease issuing certain of its insurance policies 
for example  effective july  the decision was made to focus exclusively on the california non standard personal automobile insurance market 
in contrast  in november  naicc ended a self imposed moratorium and commenced writing a new non standard automobile program under a new rate and class plan 
naicc  from time to time  has also entered into a quota share reinsurance agreement based upon its view of underwriting risk  its reserves and internal cost structure  in order to reduce its potential exposure to outstanding policies 
as a result of declining net premium production  naicc s investment base has steadily declined  its reserve adjustments on discontinued lines have disproportionately impacted current operating ratios and it continues to lose operating leverage 
as a result of positive results in the non standard automobile program in despite soft market conditions  naicc cancelled the reinsurance programs effective january  in an attempt to retain more gross premium 
results of operations as discussed above  we combined the previously separate business segments of our insurance operations and our holding company operations into one reportable segment referred to as other services during the third quarter of therefore  we currently have two reportable business segments waste and energy services and other services 
certain prior period amounts  such as holding company investment income  have been reclassified in the consolidated financial statements to conform to the current period presentation 
the results of operations for the years ended december  and are not representative of our ongoing results since we only included covanta energy s and arc holdings results of operations in our consolidated results of operations from march  and june  forward  respectively 
therefore  given the significance of the covanta energy and arc holdings acquisitions to our current and future results of operations and financial condition  we believe that an understanding of our reported results  trends and ongoing performance is enhanced by presenting results on a pro forma basis for the years ended december  and at both the consolidated and waste and energy segment levels 
our consolidated and segment results of operations  as reported and where applicable  on a pro forma basis  are summarized in the tables and discussions below 
however  the pro forma results are equivalent to reported results for the year ended december  as there are no pro forma adjustments for this period 
the pro forma based presentation assumes that the acquisitions 
table of contents of covanta energy and arc holdings both occurred on january  the pro forma financial information is presented for information purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of each period or that may result in the future 
in addition  the pro forma information provided has not been adjusted to reflect any operating efficiencies that have been realized as a result of the arc holdings acquisition 
the pro forma adjustments are described starting on page the comparability of the information provided below with respect to our revenue  expense and certain other items for periods during each of the years presented was affected materially by several factors in addition to the covanta energy and arc holdings acquisitions 
these factors principally include the exclusion of revenue and expense after may relating to the operations of the philippines magellan project mci facility  which commenced a reorganization proceeding under philippine law on may   and is no longer included as a consolidated subsidiary after such date  the reduction of revenue and expense after august relating to the philippines edison bataan facility  which ceased operations due to the expiration and termination of energy contracts  the emergence of the covanta energy s subsidiaries owning and operating the lake county  florida and warren county  new jersey energy from waste facilities the remaining debtors from bankruptcy on december  and december   respectively  and their inclusion as consolidated subsidiaries since their respective emergence dates  and the reduction of revenue and expense after may relating to the china huantai facility  which was sold in the second quarter of the factors noted above must be taken into account in developing meaningful comparisons between the periods compared below

we completed public offerings of equity and debt  including over allotment options exercised by underwriters  on january  and february   and we closed on the new credit facilities on february  we completed the tender offer of covanta energy s intermediate debt for approximately million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes on february  under the new credit facilities  we will have substantially greater  but not unrestricted  ability to make investments in our business and to take advantage of opportunities to grow our business through investments and acquisitions  both domestically and internationally 
given the significance and timing of this recapitalization  the following discussion includes cash flow and financing arrangements and information related to the recapitalization plan 
additional information  including material terms related to our recapitalization plan  is contained below under recapitalization plan 
generating sufficient cash to meet our liquidity needs  pay down debt and to invest in our business remains an important objective of management 
maintaining historic facility production levels while effectively managing operating and maintenance expenses is important to optimize long term cash generation 
we do not expect to make any cash contributions to covanta energy  except in connection with certain acquisitions and investments permitted under covanta energy s new credit facilities described below under recapitalization plan 
covanta energy may make limited cash distributions to us under the new credit facilities 
covanta energy derives its cash flows principally from its domestic and international project operations and businesses 
the frequency and predictability of covanta energy s receipt of cash from projects differs  depending upon various factors  including whether restrictions on distributions exist in applicable project debt arrangements  whether a project is domestic or international  and whether a project has been able to operate at historical levels of production 
covanta energy s receipt of cash from its international projects is also subject to satisfaction of financial tests and other covenants contained in applicable project debt arrangements 
a material portion of cash from covanta energy s international projects are received semi annually  during the second and fourth quarters 
as of december   covanta energy was in compliance with covenants under the credit facilities 
we believe that when combined with its other sources of liquidity  including the revolving loan facility that is a component of the new credit facilities  covanta energy s operations will generate sufficient cash over at least the next twelve months to meet operational needs  make capital expenditures  invest in the business and service debt due prior to maturity

under the financing arrangements existing during and prior to the new credit facilities  covanta energy s ability to pay dividends to us was limited  except in certain circumstances 
under the new credit facilities  covanta energy has greater flexibility to distribute cash to us 
various state insurance requirements restrict the amounts that may be transferred to us in the form of dividends or loans from our insurance subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval 
currently  naicc cannot pay dividends or make loans to us

cash provided from investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared with million for the comparable period in the million decrease in cash provided by investing activities in was due to a reduction in reinvestment activity in conjunction with reduced cash used in operations

naicc received net proceeds of approximately million 
there were no financing activities in either twelve month period ended december  and the insurance business  which comprises a portion of our other services segment  requires both readily liquid assets and adequate capital to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders and claimants  as well as to pay ordinary operating expenses 
the insurance business meets both its short term and long term liquidity requirements through operating cash flows that include premium receipts  investment income and reinsurance recoveries 
to the extent operating cash flows do not provide sufficient cash flow  the insurance business relies on the sale of invested assets 
its investment policy guidelines require that all loss and lae liabilities be matched by a comparable amount of investment grade assets 
we believe that the insurance business has both adequate capital resources and sufficient reinsurance to meet its current operating requirements 
the national association of insurance commissioners provides minimum solvency standards in the form of risk based capital requirements rbc 
the rbc model for property and casualty insurance companies requires that carriers report their rbc ratios based on their statutory annual statements as filed with the regulatory authorities 
we believe our insurance business has projected its rbc requirement as of december  under the rbc model and believes that it is above the level which would trigger increased oversight by regulators 
we estimate our insurance business reserves for unpaid losses and lae based on reported losses and historical experience  including losses reported by other insurance companies for reinsurance assumed  and estimates of expenses for investigating and adjusting all incurred and unadjusted claims 
key assumptions used in the estimation process could have significant effects on the reserve balances 
our insurance business regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions based on historical experience adjusted for current economic conditions and trends 
changes in the unpaid losses and lae can materially affect the statement of operations

recapitalization plan on january   we announced a comprehensive recapitalization plan utilizing a series of equity and debt financings 
subsequent to this announcement  we completed the following transactions the refinancing of covanta energy s debt facilities with new covanta energy debt facilities  comprised of a million revolving credit facility  a million funded letter of credit facility  and a million term loan collectively referred to as the new credit facilities  an underwritten public offering of million shares of our common stock  in which we received proceeds of approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions  an underwritten public offering of approximately million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures the debentures issued by us  from which we received proceeds of approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions  and the repayment  by means of a tender offer  of approximately million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes previously issued by covanta energy s intermediate subsidiaries

material terms of the equity offering on january   we completed an offering of million shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering 
the shares were sold to the public at a price of per share 
we granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock at per share for a period of days beginning on and including the date of original issuance of the shares in connection with this offering  solely to cover over allotments 
the option was exercised and such additional shares were sold on february  proceeds received in these offerings were approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions 
material terms of the debentures on january   we also completed an underwritten public offering of approximately million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible debentures due  issued by us  from which we received proceeds of approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions 
this offering included debentures sold pursuant to an over allotment option which was exercised by the underwriters 
the debentures constitute our general unsecured senior obligations and will rank equally in right of payment with any future senior unsecured indebtedness 
the debentures are effectively junior to our existing and future secured 
table of contents indebtedness  including the new credit facilities  to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness 
the debentures are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities including trade payables of our subsidiaries 
the debentures bear interest at a rate of per year  payable semi annually in arrears  on february and august of each year  commencing on august  and will mature on february  beginning with the six month interest period commencing february   we will pay contingent interest on the debentures during any six month interest period in which the trading price of the debentures measured over a specified number of trading days is or more of the principal amount of the debentures 
when applicable  the contingent interest payable per  principal amount of debentures will equal of the average trading price of  principal amount of debentures during the five trading days ending on the second trading day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month interest period 
under limited circumstances  the debentures are convertible by the holders thereof  at any time  into cash and shares of our common stock  if any  initially based on a conversion rate of shares of our common stock per  principal amount of debentures  which represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment 
in the event of certain types of fundamental changes  such as an acquisition of us by a third party  we will increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares or  in lieu thereof and if applicable  an acquirer may elect to adjust the conversion obligation and conversion rate so that the debentures are convertible based on the shares of the acquired or surviving company 
at our option  the debentures are subject to redemption at any time on or after february   in whole or in part  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the debentures being redeemed  plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest  if any

intermediate subsidiary debt tender offer on january   we commenced cash tender offers for a any and all of the outstanding msw i notes b any and all of the outstanding msw ii notes and c any and all of the outstanding arc notes 
in connection with each of the tender offers  we solicited the consents of the holders of each of the msw i notes  msw ii notes  and arc notes to certain proposed amendments to the indentures governing such notes 
the primary purpose of the solicitations and the proposed amendments was to eliminate from the indentures substantially all of the restrictive covenants  certain events of default provisions contained therein and to remove the requirements to file periodic reports with the sec for msw i and msw ii 
under the terms of the tender offer for the msw i notes and msw ii notes  we offered to purchase the outstanding msw i notes and msw ii notes for total consideration  for each  principal amount of msw i notes and msw ii notes validly tendered and accepted for payment  equal to  and  respectively  which included a consent fee of for each  principal amount of msw i notes and msw ii notes validly tendered and accepted for payment

each of the issuers entered into a supplemental indenture with the respective trustee for the applicable notes 
the supplemental indentures became operative on february   at which time we repurchased million aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes 
we intend to redeem all remaining notes in accordance with applicable provisions of the respective indentures

excludes million of covanta energy s unamortized debt premium 
payment obligations for the project debt associated with energy from waste facilities owned by covanta energy are limited recourse to the operating subsidiary and non recourse to covanta energy  subject to operating performance guarantees and commitments 
interest payments and letter of credit fees are estimated based on current rates 
retirement plan obligations are based on actuarial estimates for the pension plan obligations and post retirement plan obligations as of december  other commitments other commitments as of december  were as follows in thousands of dollars commitments expiring by period less than more than total one year one year letters of credit surety bonds total other commitments net the letters of credit were issued pursuant to the funded letter of credit facility and for two international projects under separate unsecured  letter of credit facilities to secure covanta energy s performance under various contractual undertakings related to its domestic and international projects  or to secure obligations under its insurance program 
each letter of credit relating to a project is required to be maintained in effect for the period specified in related project contracts  and generally may be drawn if it is not renewed prior to expiration of that period 
as of december   covanta energy had approximately million in available capacity for additional letters of credit under its funded letter of credit facility and million under its revolving credit facility 
covanta energy believes that it will be able to fully perform its contracts to which these existing letters of credit relate  and that it is unlikely that letters of credit would be drawn because of a default of its performance obligations 
if any of covanta energy s letters of credit were to be drawn under its current debt facilities  the amount drawn would be immediately repayable to the issuing bank 
if covanta energy were unable to immediately repay such amounts drawn under letters of credit  unreimbursed amounts would be treated as additional term loans issued under the first lien facilities 
the surety bonds listed on the table above relate primarily to performance obligations million and support for closure obligations of various energy projects when such projects cease operating million 
were these bonds to be drawn upon  covanta energy would have a contractual obligation to indemnify the surety company 
the new credit facilities include a million revolving loan facility due  which includes a million sub facility for the issuance of letters of credit  a million funded letter of credit facility  due and a million term loan facility  due for additional information  see the recapitalization plan discussion above 
we have certain contingent obligations related to the debentures 
these are holders may require us to repurchase their debentures on february   february  and february   holders may require us to repurchase their debentures if a fundamental change occurs  and 
table of contents holders may exercise their conversion rights which would require us to pay the conversion settlement amount in cash and or in our common stock 
see liquidity and capital resources recapitalization plan material terms of the debentures for specific criteria related to contingent interest  conversion or redemption features of the debentures 
covanta energy and certain of its subsidiaries have issued or are party to performance guarantees and related contractual support obligations undertaken mainly pursuant to agreements to construct and operate certain energy from waste facilities and a water facility 
with respect to its domestic businesses  covanta energy and certain of its subsidiaries have issued guarantees to municipal clients and other parties that covanta energy s subsidiaries will perform in accordance with contractual terms  including  where required  the payment of damages or other obligations 
such contractual damages or other obligations could be material  and in circumstances where one or more subsidiary s contract has been terminated for its default  such damages could include amounts sufficient to repay project debt 
for facilities owned by municipal clients and operated by covanta energy  covanta energy s potential maximum liability as of december  associated with the repayment of the municipalities project debt on such facilities was approximately billion 
this amount was not recorded as a liability in covanta energy s consolidated balance sheet as of december  as covanta energy believes that it had not incurred such liability at the date of the financial statements 
additionally  damages payable under such guarantees on covanta energy owned energy from waste facilities could expose covanta energy to recourse liability on project debt 
covanta energy also believes that it has not incurred such liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
if covanta energy is asked to perform under one or more of such guarantees  its liability for damages upon contract termination would be reduced by funds held in trust and proceeds from sales of the facilities securing the project debt  which is presently not estimable 
with respect to its international businesses  covanta energy and certain of its subsidiaries have issued guarantees on behalf of our international operating subsidiaries with respect to contractual obligations to operate certain international power projects and one energy from waste project 
the potential damages owed under such arrangements for international projects may be material 
see item a 
risk factors covanta energy and certain of its subsidiaries have provided guarantees and support in connection with its subsidiaries projects 
depending upon the circumstances giving rise to such domestic and international damages  the contractual terms of the applicable contracts  and the contract counterparty s choice of remedy at the time a claim against a guarantee is made  the amounts owed pursuant to one or more of such guarantees could be greater than covanta energy s then available sources of funds 
to date  covanta energy has not incurred material liabilities under its guarantees  either on domestic or international projects 
insurance coverage we have obtained insurance for our assets and operations that provides coverage for what we believe are probable maximum losses  subject to self insured retentions  policy limits and premium costs which we believe to be appropriate 
however  the insurance obtained does not cover us for all possible losses 
off balance sheet arrangements subsidiaries of covanta energy are parties to lease arrangements with covanta energy s municipal clients at its union county  new jersey  its alexandria  virginia and its delaware county  pennsylvania energy from waste facilities 
at its union county facility  covanta energy s operating subsidiary leases the facility from the union county utilities authority  referred to as the ucua  under a lease that expires in  which covanta energy may extend for an additional five years 
covanta energy guarantees a portion of the rent due under the lease 
rent under the lease is sufficient to allow the ucua to repay tax exempt bonds issued by it to finance the facility and which mature in at its alexandria facility  a covanta energy subsidiary is a party to a lease which expires in related to certain pollution control equipment that was required in connection with the clean air act amendments of  and which was financed by the city of alexandria and by arlington county  virginia 
covanta energy s subsidiary 
table of contents owns this facility  and rent under this lease is sufficient to pay debt service on tax exempt bonds issued to finance such equipment and which mature in at its covanta delaware valley  lp delaware valley facility  a covanta energy subsidiary is a party to a lease for the facility that expires in covanta energy s operating subsidiary  referred to as the delaware partnership  is obligated to pay a portion of lease rent  designated as basic rent b  and could be liable to pay certain related contractually specified amounts  referred to as stipulated loss  in the event of a default in the payment of rent under the delaware valley lease beyond the applicable grace period 
the stipulated loss is similar to lease termination liability and is generally intended to provide the lessor with the economic value of the lease  for the remaining lease term  had the default in rent payment not occurred 
the balance of rental and stipulated loss obligations are payable by a trust formed and collateralized by the project s former operator in connection with the disposition of its interest in the delaware valley facility 
pursuant to the terms of various guarantee agreements  arc holdings has guaranteed the payments of basic rent b and stipulated loss to the extent such payments are not made by the delaware partnership 
we do not believe  however  that such payments constitute a material obligation of our subsidiary since our subsidiary expects to continue to operate the delaware valley facility in the ordinary course for the entire term of the lease and will continue to pay rent throughout the term of the lease 
as of december   the estimated stipulated loss would have been million 
covanta energy is also a party to lease arrangements pursuant to which it leases rolling stock in connection with its energy from waste and independent power facilities  as well as certain office equipment 
rent payable under these arrangements is not material to our financial condition 
covanta energy generally uses operating lease treatment for all of the foregoing arrangements 
a summary of the operating lease obligations is contained in note leases of the notes 
as described above under other commitments  covanta energy and certain of its subsidiaries have issued or are party to performance guarantees and related contractual obligations undertaken mainly pursuant to agreements to construct and operate certain energy and waste facilities 
to date  covanta energy has not incurred material liabilities under its guarantees  either on domestic or international projects 
covanta energy has investments in several investees and joint ventures which are accounted for under the equity and cost methods and therefore we do not consolidate the financial information of those companies 
see note equity in net income from unconsolidated investments of the notes for additional information regarding these leases 
discussion of critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
many of our critical accounting policies are subject to significant judgments and uncertainties which could potentially result in materially different results under different conditions and assumptions 
future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r using the modified prospective transition method and therefore we have not restated results for prior periods 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  included compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 

table of contents we calculate the fair value of our share based option awards using the black scholes option pricing model which requires estimates of the expected life of the award and stock price volatility 
we calculate the fair value of our share based stock awards based on the average of the high and low price on the day prior to the grant date  however  we intend to use the closing price on the date of the grant for any new awards granted commencing in in order to align our valuation with the sec s new disclosure requirements 
in addition  we also estimate expected forfeitures for our options and share based awards and the probability of achieving specific performance factors affecting the vesting of our share based awards 
for our current share based awards  our estimate of a forfeiture rate and determination of achieving stated performance vesting factors will have the most significant impact on the compensation cost we must recognize 
we recognized compensation expense based upon the number of stock options and restricted stock awards expected to vest  which was determined based on historical turnover experience of various covanta energy employee populations from the covanta energy pension plan 
we review the forfeiture rate at least annually and revise compensation expense  if necessary 
we recognize compensation costs using the graded vesting attribution method over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the vesting term of three years 
purchase accounting we have applied purchase accounting in accordance with the sfas no 
 business combinations  for acquisitions consummated in  and as described in note acquisitions and dispositions of the notes  we valued the acquired assets and liabilities assumed at fair value 
the fair value estimates used reflect our best estimates based on our work and the work of independent valuation consultants based on relevant information available to us 
these estimates  and the assumptions used by us and by our valuation consultants  are subject to inherent uncertainties and contingencies beyond our control 
for example  we used the discounted cash flow method to estimate the value of many of our assets 
this entailed developing projections about future cash flows and adopting an appropriate discount rate 
we cannot predict with certainty actual cash flows and the selection of a discount rate is heavily dependent on judgment 
if different cash flow projections or discount rates were used  the fair values of our assets and liabilities could be materially increased or decreased 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions reflected in the valuations will be realized  or that further adjustments will not occur 
the assumptions and estimates used by us substantially affect our balance sheet 
in addition  the valuations impact depreciation and amortization expense and changes in such assumptions and estimates may affect earnings in the future 
during the current year  some of our estimates have been refined which resulted in changes to assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet as of december  depreciation and amortization we have estimated the useful lives over which we depreciate our long lived assets 
additionally  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  we have capitalized the estimate of our legal liabilities which includes closure and post closure costs for landfill cells and site restoration for certain energy from waste and power producing sites 
goodwill and intangible assets we have recognized goodwill and intangible assets relative to our acquisition of arc holdings and covanta energy s emergence from bankruptcy in in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when indications of impairment exist 
there has been no impairment recognized in the current year  however an impact of impairment in the future could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate our long term assets and amortizable intangible assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
no events or change in circumstances occurred during the period to warrant this testing 
however  had an event or change in circumstances occurred  the impact of recognizing an impairment could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents net operating loss carryforwards deferred tax assets as described in note income taxes of the notes  we have recorded a deferred tax asset related to the nols 
the amount recorded was calculated based upon future taxable income arising from a the reversal of temporary differences during the period the nols are available and b future operating income expected from our domestic and international businesses  to the extent it is reasonably predictable 
we estimated that we have nols of approximately million for federal income tax purposes as of the end of the nols will expire in various amounts beginning on december  through december   if not used 
the amount of nols available to us will be reduced by any taxable income generated by current members of our tax consolidated group including certain grantor trusts relating to the mission insurance entities 
the internal revenue service irs has not audited any of our tax returns for the years in which the losses giving rise to the nols were reported  and the irs could challenge any past and future use of the nols 
beginning in the second quarter of  we adopted the permanent reinvestment exception under apb  whereby we will no longer provide deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries 
we intend to permanently reinvest our international earnings outside of the united states in our existing international operations and in any new international business we may develop or acquire 
loss contingencies as described in note commitments and contingencies of the notes  our subsidiaries are party to a number of claims  lawsuits and pending actions  most of which are routine and all of which are incidental to our business 
we assess the likelihood of potential losses with respect to these matters on an ongoing basis and when losses are considered probable and reasonably estimable  we record as a loss an estimate of the ultimate outcome 
if we can only estimate the range of a possible loss  an amount representing the low end of the range of possible outcomes is recorded and disclosure is made regarding the possibility of additional losses 
we review such estimates on an ongoing basis as developments occur with respect to such matters and may in the future increase or decrease such estimates 
there can be no assurance that our initial or adjusted estimates of losses will reflect the ultimate loss we may experience regarding such matters 
any inaccuracies could potentially have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition 
financial instruments as described in note financial instruments of the notes  the estimated fair value amounts have been determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies 
however  considerable judgment is necessarily required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we would realize in a current market exchange 
for cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  and marketable securities  the carrying value of these amounts is a reasonable estimate of their fair value 
the fair value of restricted funds held in trust is based on quoted market prices of the investments held by the trustee 
fair values for debt were determined based on interest rates that are currently available to us for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities for debt issues that are not traded on quoted market prices 
the fair value of project debt is estimated based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues 
the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements is the estimated amount we would receive or pay to terminate the agreement based on the net present value of the future cash flows as defined in the agreement 
revenue recognition we earn fees to service project debt principal and interest where such fees are expressly included as a component of the service fee paid by the client community pursuant to applicable energy from waste service agreements 
regardless of the timing of amounts paid by client communities relating to project debt principal  we record service revenue with respect to this principal component on a levelized basis over the term of the applicable 
table of contents service agreement 
unbilled service receivables related to energy from waste operations are discounted in recognizing the present value for services performed currently in order to service the principal component of the project debt 
such unbilled receivables amounted to million as of december  fees for waste disposal are recognized in the period received 
revenue from electricity and steam sales are recorded when delivered at rates specified in the contracts 
we also earn fees under fixed price construction contracts  in which case revenue is accounted for using the percentage of completion of services rendered 
pensions covanta energy has defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans that cover its employees 
domestic employees not participating in our retirement plans generally participate in retirement plans offered by collective bargaining units of which these employees are members 
of our international employees  participate in defined benefit or defined contribution retirement plans as required or available in accordance with local laws 
we froze the covanta energy defined benefit pension plan effective december  all active employees who were eligible participants in the covanta energy defined benefit pension plan as of december   were vested and had a nonforfeitable right to this benefit as of december  beginning january   all eligible employees received a company contribution into a new defined contribution retirement plan 
covanta energy recorded a pension plan liability equal to the amount by which the present value of the projected benefit obligations using a discount rate of exceeded the fair value of pension assets as of december  unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses our insurance subsidiaries establish loss and lae reserves that are estimates of amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses in the future for insured events that have already occurred 
the process of estimating reserves involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and  as of any given date  is inherently uncertain 
reserves are typically comprised of case reserves for claims reported and reserves for losses that have occurred but for which claims have not yet been reported  referred to as incurred but not reported ibnr reserves  which include a provision for expected future development on case reserves 
case reserves are estimated based on the experience and knowledge of claims staff regarding the nature and potential cost of each claim and are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made 
ibnr reserves are derived by subtracting paid loss and lae and case reserves from estimates of ultimate loss and lae 
actuaries estimate ultimate loss and lae using various generally accepted actuarial methods applied to known losses and other relevant information 
like case reserves  ibnr reserves are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made 
ultimate loss and lae are generally determined by extrapolation of claim emergence and settlement patterns observed in the past that can reasonably be expected to persist into the future 
in forecasting ultimate loss and lae with respect to any line of business  past experience with respect to that line of business is the primary resource  but cannot be relied upon in isolation 
the insurance businesses own experience  particularly claims development experience  such as trends in case reserves  payments on and closings of claims  as well as changes in business mix and coverage limits  are the most important information for estimating reserves 
uncertainties in estimating ultimate loss and lae are magnified by the time lag between when a claim actually occurs and when it is reported and settled 
this time lag is sometimes referred to as the claim tail 
the claim tail for most property coverages is typically short usually a few days up to a few months 
the claim tail for automobile liability is relatively short usually one to two years and liability casualty coverages  such as general liability  multiple peril coverage  and workers compensation  can be especially long as claims are often reported and ultimately paid or settled years  even decades  after the related loss events occur 
during the long claims reporting and settlement period  additional facts regarding coverages written in prior accident years  as well as about actual claims and trends may become known and  as a result  the insurance subsidiaries may adjust their reserves 
if we determine that an adjustment is appropriate  the adjustment is booked in the accounting period in which such determination is made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
accordingly  should reserves need to be increased or decreased in the future from amounts currently established  future results of operations would be negatively or positively impacted  respectively 

table of contents our insurance subsidiaries use independent actuaries which we significantly rely on to form a conclusion on reserve estimates 
those independent actuaries use several generally accepted actuarial methods to evaluate the insurance business loss reserves  each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses 
the independent actuaries place more or less reliance on a particular method based on the facts and circumstances at the time the reserve estimates are made and through discussions with our insurance subsidiaries management

shaw laminar portfolios  llc laminar and it becoming a stockholder  pursuant to a letter agreement dated december   laminar agreed to transfer restrictions on the shares of common stock that laminar acquired pursuant to the note purchase agreement 
further  in accordance with the transfer restrictions previously contained in article fifth of our charter restricting the resale of our common stock by stockholders  we agreed with laminar to provide it with limited rights to resell the common stock that it holds 
during laminar sold a portion of its holdings pursuant to these in accordance with this agreement 
on november   our stockholders approved an amendment to our restated certificate of incorporation which removed the transfer restrictions previously contained in article fifth 
as part of the covanta energy acquisition in march  we agreed to conduct a rights offering for up to million shares of our common stock to certain holders of debentures issued by covanta energy prior to its bankruptcy at a purchase price of per share the offering 
the offering was made solely to those holders of covanta energy s debentures which had been issued prior to its bankruptcy who had voted in favor of covanta energy s second reorganization plan on january  or were otherwise authorized to participate by the bankruptcy court 
laminar held a portion of such debentures and was entitled to participate in the offering 
on january   we entered into a letter agreement with laminar pursuant to which we agreed that if the offering had not closed prior to the record date for the arc holdings rights offering  then we would revise the offering so that the holders that participated in the offering would be offered additional shares of our common stock at the same purchase price as in the arc holdings rights offering and in an amount equal to the number of shares of common stock that such holders would have been entitled to purchase in the arc holdings rights offering if the offering was consummated on or prior to the record date for the arc holdings rights offering 
accordingly  we restructured our offering to offer up to an additional million contingently issuable shares at per share 
the offering was completed on february  and laminar exercised its rights to purchase a total of  shares

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our subsidiaries are party to financial instruments that are subject to market risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices 
our use of derivative instruments is very limited and we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to financial instruments with market risks 
we use a sensitivity model to evaluate the fair value or cash flows of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assumes instantaneous  parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rate yield curves 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented  primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel manner and that interest rates change instantaneously 
in addition  the fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information available to us as of december  further information is included in note financial instruments of the notes 
waste and energy services interest rate risk covanta energy and or its subsidiaries have project debt outstanding bearing interest at floating rates that could subject them to the risk of increased interest expense due to rising market interest rates  or an adverse change in fair value due to declining interest rates on fixed rate debt 
of covanta energy s project debt  approximately million was floating rate debt at december  however  the entire interest rate risk related to the floating rate project debt is borne by the client communities because debt service is passed through to those clients under the contractual structure of their waste services agreements 
covanta energy had only one interest rate swap relating to project debt outstanding as of december  in the notional amount of million related to floating rate project debt 
gains and losses  however  on this swap are for the account of the client community and are not borne by covanta energy 
as described in note long term debt of the notes  covanta energy was required  under financing arrangements in effect since june   to enter into hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of its exposure to interest rate changes with respect to its borrowing under the financing arrangements 
on july   covanta energy entered into two pay fixed  receive floating interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million 
on march   we entered into one additional pay fixed  receive floating interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million 
on december   the notional amount of the original swap agreements reduced to million from million 
these swaps were designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative and hedging activities 
accordingly  unrealized gains or losses will be deferred in other comprehensive income until the hedged cash flows affect earnings 
on february   the swap arrangements described above were settled and unrealized gains of million  net of tax  related to the swap arrangements were reflected in earnings 
we have not entered into interest rate swap arrangements related to the recapitalization plan and therefore increased our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
we do not believe these risks to be material to our cash flows and results of operations 
for floating rate project debt  a percent hypothetical increase in the underlying december  market interest rates would result in a potential loss to twelve month future earnings of million 
for fixed rate project debt  the potential reduction in fair value from a percent hypothetical increase in the underlying december  market interest rates would be approximately million 
the fair value of covanta energy s fixed rate project debt including billion in fixed rate debt related to revenue bonds in which debt service is an explicit component of the service fees billed to the client communities was billion as of december   and was determined using average market quotations of price and yields provided by investment banks 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk we have investments in energy projects in various foreign countries  including the philippines  china  india and bangladesh  and to a much lesser degree  italy and costa rica 
we do not enter into currency transactions to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
instead  we attempt to mitigate our currency risks by structuring our project contracts so that our revenues are adjusted in line with corresponding changes in currency rates 
therefore  only working capital and project debt denominated in other than a project entity s functional currency are exposed to currency risks 
as of december   covanta energy had million of project debt related to two diesel engine projects in india 
for million of the debt related to project entities whose functional currency is the indian rupee  exchange rate fluctuations were recorded as translation adjustments in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
the remaining million of debt was denominated in us dollars 
the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a adverse change in december  quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million 
as of december   we also had net investments in foreign subsidiaries and projects 
see note equity in net income from unconsolidated investments of the notes for further discussion 
commodity price risk and contract revenue risk we have not entered into futures  forward contracts  swaps or options to hedge purchase and sale commitments  fuel requirements  inventories or other commodities 
alternatively  we attempt to mitigate the risk of energy and fuel market fluctuations by structuring contracts related to our energy projects in the manner described above under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview contract structures 
generally  we are protected against fluctuations in the waste disposal market  and thus our ability to charge acceptable fees for our services  through long term service agreements and disposal contracts at our energy from waste facilities 
at eight of our energy from waste facilities  differing amounts of waste disposal capacity are not subject to long term contracts and  therefore  we are partially exposed to the risk of market fluctuations in the waste disposal fees we may charge 
at our energy from waste facilities  we sell recovered ferrous metals  the price of which is subject to market influences 
our long term service agreements begin to expire in  and energy sales contracts at owned projects generally expire at or after the date on which that project s long term agreement expires 
expiration of these contracts will subject us to greater market risk in maintaining and enhancing our revenues 
as our agreements at municipally owned projects expire  we will seek to enter into renewal or replacement contracts to continue operating such projects 
as our agreements at facilities we own begin to expire  we intend to seek replacement or additional contracts for waste supplies  and because project debt on these facilities will be paid off at such time  we expect to be able to offer disposal services at rates that will attract sufficient quantities of waste and provide acceptable revenues 
we will seek to bid competitively in the market for additional contracts to operate other facilities as similar contracts of other vendors expire 
at facilities we own  the expiration of existing energy sales contracts will require us to sell our output either into the local electricity grid or pursuant to new contracts 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into such renewals  replacement or additional contracts  or that the price and other terms available in the market at the time will be favorable to us 
we have similar protection against energy market fluctuations at most of our projects  which have long term contracts for the sale of energy output 
we enter into shorter term arrangements for energy sales  or have market based pricing at four of our projects and have some exposure to energy market fluctuations with respect to these projects 
in addition  we sell recovered materials  principally ferrous metals  under short term arrangements from most of our energy from waste projects  and have some exposure to market fluctuations with respect to such sales 
while the ferrous metals markets fluctuate  given the amount of revenue we derive from such sales  we do not expect any such fluctuations to have a material affect on our financial results 

table of contents other services risk related to the investment portfolio naicc s objectives in managing its investment portfolio are to maximize investment income and investment returns while minimizing overall market risk 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including duration of liabilities  underwriting results  overall tax position  regulatory requirements  and fluctuations in interest rates 
investment decisions are made by management  in consultation with an independent investment advisor  and approved by naicc s board of directors 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of securities 
the market risks related to naicc s fixed maturity portfolio are primarily credit risk  interest rate risk  reinvestment risk and prepayment risk 
the market risk related to naicc s equity portfolio is price risk 
fixed maturities interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of fixed maturities to changes in interest rate 
we view these potential changes in price within the overall context of asset and liability matching 
we estimate the payout patterns of naicc s liabilities  primarily loss reserves  to determine their duration 
duration targets are set for the fixed income portfolio after consideration of the duration of naicc s liabilities that we believe mitigates the overall interest rate risk 
naicc s exposure to interest rate risk is mitigated by the relative short term nature of its insurance and other liabilities 
the effective duration of the portfolio as of december  and was years and years  respectively 
we believe the portfolio duration is appropriate given the relative short tail nature of the auto programs and projected run off of all other lines of business 
a hypothetical basis point increase in market interest rates would cause an approximate decrease in the fair value of the portfolio while a hypothetical basis point decrease would cause an approximate increase in fair value 
credit risk is the price sensitivity of fixed maturities to changes in the credit quality of such investment 
naicc s exposure to credit risk is mitigated by its investment in high quality fixed income alternatives 
fixed maturities of naicc include mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations  collectively mbs representing and of total fixed maturities at december  and  respectively 
all mbs held by naicc were issued by the federal national mortgage association fnma or the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  which are both rated aaa by moody s investors services 
both fnma and fhlmc are corporations that were created by acts of congress 
fnma and fhlmc guarantee the principal balance of their securities 
fnma guarantees timely payment of principal and interest 
one of the risks associated with mbs is the timing of principal payments on the mortgages underlying the securities 
naicc attempts to limit repayment risk by purchasing mbs whose cost is below or does not significantly exceed par  and by primarily purchasing structured securities with repayment protection which provides more certain cash flow to the investor such as mbs with sinking fund schedules known as planned amortization classes pac and targeted amortization classes tac 
the structures of pacs and tacs attempt to increase the certainty of the timing of prepayment and thereby minimize the prepayment and interest rate risk 
in  naicc recognized less than million in loss on sales of fixed maturities 
mbs  as well as callable bonds  have a greater sensitivity to market value declines in a rising interest rate environment than to market value increases in a declining interest rate environment 
naicc realized significant increases in its prepayments of principal during and to a lesser extent in and the prepayments mitigated the need to sell securities to meet operating cash requirements as noted previously 
equity securities in the third and fourth quarter of  naicc began investing in equity securities  generally limited to fortune companies with strong balance sheets  history of dividend growth and price appreciation 
as of december   equity securities represented of the total naicc investment portfolio
