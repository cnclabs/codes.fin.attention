our equipment fleet increased by in on a teu basis 
our revenue earning asset growth was significantly higher on a dollar basis  at 
our growth in the net book value of our revenue earning assets exceeded our growth rate on a teu basis  since our new chassis and port equipment investments are much more expensive than dry containers on a per teu basis 
the growth of our fleet has decreased the average age  and increased the average net book value  of the units in our fleet 
in  excluding trader units purchased for resale  we added approximately  teu of new equipment to our fleet and sold approximately  teu of our older equipment 
over the last three years  our disposal of older equipment  excluding trader units purchased for resale  has averaged approximately of our beginning fleet on an annual basis 
as such  our disposal rate in recent years has been close to our theorectical steady state disposal rate given the year expected useful life of our containers 
based on the age profile of our existing fleet and scheduled lease expirations  we expect our rate of disposals will increase for several years beginning in we invested in a relatively small number of containers from through  and as a result  a large portion of the containers in our fleet are ten years and older 
we currently plan that our annual rate of disposals will increase into the range in and for several years thereafter  before decreasing significantly for several years after 
table of contents the bulk of the pre containers are sold 
during years of above average disposals  our teu growth rate may be constrained if we are unable to generate a sufficient number of attractive lease transactions for an expanded level of new container purchases 
we generally lease our equipment on a per diem basis to our customers under three types of leases long term leases  service leases and finance leases 
long term leases  typically with terms of three to eight years  provide us with stable cash flow and low transaction costs by requiring customers to maintain specific units on hire for the duration of the lease 
service leases command a premium per diem rate in exchange for providing customers with a greater level of operational flexibility by allowing the pick up and drop off of units during the lease term 
finance leases  which are typically structured as full payout leases  provide for a predictable recurring revenue stream with the lowest daily cost to the customer because cust omers are generally required to retain the equipment for the duration of its useful life 
as of december   approximately of our containers and chassis were on hire to customers  with approximately of our equipment on long term leases  approximately on service leases or long term leases whose fixed terms have expired but for which the related units remain on hire and for which we continue to receive rental payments  and approximately on finance leases 
in addition  approximately of our fleet was available for lease and approximately was available for sale 
the following table provides a summary of our lease portfolio  based on units in the fleet as of the dates indicated below

operating performance our profitability is primarily determined by the extent to which our leasing and other revenues exceed our ownership  operating and administrative expenses 
our profitability is also impacted by the gain or loss that we realize on the sale of our used equipment 
during the first half of  seasonal factors and market conditions placed pressure on our profitability 
our operating profitability improved in the latter part of as we were able to benefit from an increase in container prices and an improvement in market conditions 
our leasing revenue is primarily driven by our owned fleet size  utilization and average rental rates 
our leasing revenue is also impacted by the mix of leases in our portfolio 
as of december   our fleet included  teu  an increase of from december  the increase in fleet size relative to the fourth quarter of was mainly due to the delivery of a large number of containers purchased in the first nine months of these deliveries proved to be timely since they allowed us to capitalize on the strong leasing demand for dry containers that we experienced early in the second quarter and late in the third quarter 
container deliveries were lower in the fourth quarter since we ordered fewer cont ainers in the third quarter due to price uncertainty and our expectation for reduced dry container demand after the end of the summer peak season 

table of contents the following table sets forth our average equipment fleet utilization for the periods indicated below

utilization is computed by dividing our total units on lease by the total units in our fleet which includes leased units  new and used units available for lease and units available for sale 
our average utilization was in the year ended december   an increase of from the year ended december  our utilization increased steadily throughout  and our ending utilization increased from as of december  to as of december  at the beginning of  the utilization of our dry and refrigerated containers was relatively low  reflecting an over building of containers in and a resulting slow market for container leasing 
utilization for our dry containers began to improve in the second quarter of as a shortage of new containers developed in asia due to stronger than expected cargo demand and production delays at several container manufacturing facilities 
dry container leasing demand moderated over the summer before increasing at the end of the third quarter 
our dry container utilization remained high throughout the fourth quarter despite the end of the summer peak season due to strong cargo volumes and the completion of a number of lease extension transactions which reduced the number of containers that our customers were able to return 
utilization for our refrigerated containers remained low for most of before improving during the fourth quarter 
since our refrigerated containers represent only of our containers on a teu basis  the performance of our refrigerated containers does not heavily influence our overall utilization 
however  refrigerated containers are much more expensive than our other container types and represent nearly of our revenue earning assets and nearly of our leasing revenue  and the utilization of our refrigerated container fleet has a significant impact on our overall financial performance 
utilization for our refrigerated containers remained low for most of due to the weak leasing market we experienced during the winter season 
the winter season is typically our peak leasing season for refrigerated containers due to demand from northern hemisphere consumers for fresh fruits and vegetables during the winter months  and the winter leasing market was weak partially due to an increase in new container buying by our customers 
after the weak winter season  our refrigerated container utilization remained low for the second and third quarters  mostly reflecting the typical softness of the summer months 
however  leasing demand increased sharply at the beginning of the winter peak season and the utilization of our refrigerated containers increased during the fourth quarter 
utilization for our special containers increased steadily during reflecting strong leasing demand for special containers throughout the year 
average lease rates for our dry container product line in december decreased by approximately compared to december despite the high new container prices that prevailed during the latter part of the decrease in average dry container leasing rates was primarily caused by several large lease extension transactions completed during the second and third quarters of the profitability of our shipping line customers came under pressure in due to a large increase in vessel capacity and decreasing freight rates  and our customers were actively seeking ways to reduce operating expenses 
in several cases  we responded to our customers requests for lease rate reductions by renewing or extending lease agreem ents early in return for lease rate savings  and in we completed lease extension transactions that cover more than of the dry containers and nearly of the refrigerated containers in our fleet 
while these lease extension transactions reduced our revenue in  we expect they will have a positive impact on the net present value of our lease portfolio  particularly for our older containers  since they extend the revenue earning life of the containers 
the higher price of new containers was also not heavily reflected in our average lease rates 
table of contents since a large portion of the containers we supplied to our customers in were placed on leases negotiated during the first quarter when container prices and market leasing rates were low 
new dry container prices were highly volatile in container prices were very low at the beginning of the year  then increased roughly in the second quarter 
container prices began to decrease at the end of the third quarter  although they strengthened at the end of the year to finish above  for a foot dry container 
our average lease rates for refrigerated containers in december decreased by approximately compared to december mainly due to a large lease extension transaction completed at the beginning of the third quarter 
average lease rates for special containers in increased by approximately as compared to the percentage of our units on finance leases increased to as of december   compared to at the beginning of the year 
finance lease revenue increased to million in as compared to million in the prior year 
however  the increase in the portion of our units on finance leases during resulted in a reduction in our overall leasing revenue compared to the level we would have achieved if the equipment was placed on operating leases 
under a finance lease  we recognize only interest income as revenue while the principle component of the lease payment reduces the net finance lease receivable on the balance sheet 
under an operating lease  we recognize the entire monthly billing as revenue and re duce the net book value of the underlying equipment through depreciation expense 
during  we recognized a gain of million on the sale of our used containers 
our disposal results improved throughout the year after beginning slowly in the first quarter 
in the first quarter  we recorded a loss of million on the sale of used equipment due to a low volume of disposals and price pressure resulting from the decrease in new container prices at the end of selling prices and volumes improved in the second quarter of due to an increase in container demand and an increase in the price of new containers  and disposal volumes and prices remained at a high level for the rest of the year 
our gains on sale were also helped in the third and fourth quarters by a finance lease transaction for a porti on of our older containers and gains resulting from an unusually high number of units reported lost by our customers 
due to the strong disposal volumes we achieved in the latter part of the year  the portion of our container fleet identified as for sale decreased from as of december  to as of december  our direct operating expenses decreased by million in as compared to mainly due to lower positioning and repair costs 
our operating expenses remain at historically low levels due to the high utilization of our container fleet  the large portion of our units on long term and finance leases and the large portion of our returned units that are sale age 
typically we incur reduced repair and positioning expenses when returned equipment is sold rather than re leased 
our ownership expenses  principally depreciation and interest expense decreased by million in as compared to the decrease in depreciation expense in resulted from the increase in the portion of our equipment covered by finance leases as well as the termination of depreciation charges for equipment that reached the end of its estimated depreciable life at the end of  but remain in our fleet 
the significant reduction in interest expense in compared to the level we experienced in was due to the benefit of lower interest rates from our securitization program  as well as the large reduction in the amount of outstanding debt that we achieved as a result of our initial public offering in the fourth quarter of last year 
we made improvements in our debt financing structure in on april   we successfully completed the placement of our million series floating rate secured notes the abs term notes 
the net proceeds from this offering  together with cash on hand  were used to repay all principal and interest that was owed under the asset securitization facility 
simultaneously with the closing of the abs term note offering  we also completed the placement of our million series floating rate secured notes the abs warehouse facility 
the abs warehouse facility has a two year revolving period in which we can meet our new equipment procurement funding requirements 
these two transactions have positively impacted our operating 
table of contents performance by reducing the borrowing spread on million of our previously outstanding indebtedness while also allowing us to finance our growth at significantly reduced rates 
we also successfully renegotiated our senior secured credit facility to reduce the borrowing spread by and reduce our commitment from million to million 
dividends on august   our board of directors approved and declared a per share quarterly cash dividend on our issued and outstanding common stock  which was paid on september  to shareholders of record at the close of business on september  on november   our board of directors approved and declared a per share quarterly cash dividend on our issued and outstanding common stock  which was paid on december  to shareholders of record at the close of business on november  on december   our board of directors approved and declared a per share quarterly cash dividend on our issued and outstanding common stock  which will be payable on march  to shareholders of record at the close of business on february  treasury stock we repurchased  of our common shares in the open market during at a total cost of approximately million

total leasing revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
the decrease primarily resulted from lower per diem rates for dry and refrigerated containers and lower 
table of contents utilization for refrigerated containers 
while our finance lease revenue increased by million  the increase in the portion of our units on finance leases resulted in a reduction in our overall leasing revenue compared to the amount we would have recognized if the units were placed on operating leases 
under a finance lease  we only recognize interest income as revenue while the principal component of the lease payment reduces the net finance lease receivable on the balance sheet 
under an operating lease we recognize the entire monthly billing as revenue  and reduce the net book value of the underlying equipment through depreciation expense 
equipment trading activities 
equipment trading revenue represents the proceeds on the sale of equipment purchased for resale 
equipment trading expenses represents the cost of equipment sold as well as related selling costs

the net equipment trading margin decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in  third party selling margins were supported by increasing used container sale prices for most of the year  which generally increased the value of our trading inventory during the period the containers were held 
in  revenues decreased primarily due to lower selling prices  while expenses remained stable 
direct operating expenses

direct operating expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
during the year ended december   positioning costs decreased by million resulting from fewer units moved  and repairs decreased by million due to a decrease in the number of units repaired 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in storage and handling costs of million due to lower utilization and higher volume of units picked up and dropped off 
additionally  other operating expenses increased by million primarily due to higher equipment inspection and survey costs 
administrative expenses 
administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
this decrease was mainly due to a stock compensation charge of million associated with stock options issued to certain members of management that fully vested upon completion of the ipo 
this decrease was partially offset by costs incurred for sarbanes oxley compliance activities in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease was primarily due to certain equipment becoming fully depreciated in the fourth quarter of in addition  a larger portion of our fleet was placed on finance leases in  and units on finance leases are not subject to depreciation

table of contents investor as part of our managed equipment program 
in addition  results in were supported by very strong selling prices for used containers 
write off of deferred financing costs 
write off of deferred financing costs was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the current year write off is the result of the refinancing of the company s asset securitization facility in april the prior year write offs were the result of refinancing our senior secured credit facility in august  when we wrote off million of unamortized financing costs that were previously deferred and the repayment of the senior unsecured credit agreement in october  when we wrote off million of unamortized financing costs that were previously deferred 
interest and debt expense 
interest and debt expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million

unrealized loss gain on interest rate swaps 
unrealized loss on interest rate swaps was million for the year ended december   compared to unrealized gain of million for the year ended december  the net fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was approximately million at december   as compared to million at december   with the decrease in fair value due to a decrease in interest rates

amounts include actual and estimated interest for floating rate debt based on december  rates and the net effect of the interest rate swaps 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such entities which are often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
we are  therefore  not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates are based on historical experience and currently available information 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following paragraphs summarize our critical accounting policies 
additional accounting policies are discussed in the notes to our historical financial statements contained elsewhere in this form k 
revenue recognition operating leases with customers we enter into long term leases and service leases with ocean carriers  principally as lessor in operating leases  for marine cargo equipment 
long term leases provide our customers with specified equipment for a specified term 
our leasing revenues are based upon the number of equipment units leased  the applicable per diem rate and the length of the lease 
long term leases typically range for a period of three to eight years 
revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the respective lease 
advanced billings are deferred and recognized in the period earned 
service leases 
table of contents do not specify the exact number of equipment units to be leased or the term that each unit will remain on hire but allow the lessee to pick up and drop off units at various locations specified in the lease agreement 
under a service lease  rental revenue is based on the number of equipment units on hire for a given period 
revenue for customers where collection is not reasonably assured is deferred and recognized when the amounts are received 
also  in accordance with eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  we recognize billings to customers for damages incurred and certain other pass through costs as leasing revenue as it is earned based on the terms of the contractual agreements with the customer 
finance leases with customers we enter into finance leases as lessor for some of the equipment in our fleet 
the net investment in finance leases represents the receivables due from lessees  net of unearned income 
unearned income is recognized on a level yield basis over the lease term and is recorded as leasing revenue 
finance leases are usually long term in nature  typically ranging for a period of five to ten years and typically include a bargain purchase option to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term 
equipment trading revenue and expense equipment trading revenue represents the proceeds on the sale of equipment purchased for resale 
the related expenses represent the cost of equipment sold as well as other selling costs that are recognized as incurred and are reflected as equipment trading expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
management fee income we manage equipment which is owned by third parties and we earn management fees based on the income earned by the leasing and sales of such equipment 
amounts we collect as agent on behalf of third parties that own such equipment are not included in revenue and costs paid for managed equipment are not included in expense 
other revenues other revenues include fee income for third party positioning of equipment 
direct operating expenses direct operating expenses are directly related to our equipment under and available for lease 
these expenses primarily consist of our costs to repair and maintain the equipment  to reposition the equipment  to store the equipment when it is not on lease  and a provision for equipment lost or not expected to be returned 
these costs are recognized when incurred 
in limited situations  certain positioning costs may be capitalized 
leasing equipment leasing equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated to an estimated residual value on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life 
we will continue to review our depreciation policies on a regular basis to determine whether changes have taken place that would suggest that a change in our depreciation policies  useful lives of our equipment or the assigned residual values is warranted 
in addition  periodically a determination is made  if indicators of impairment are present  as to whether the carrying value of our fleet exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
the estimated useful lives for our leasing equipment ranges from to years from the date of manufacture  for both the successor and predecessor companies 
estimated useful lives have been based on independent appraisals and will be adjusted if necessary based on actual experience 
costs incurred to place new equipment into service  including costs to transport the equipment to its initial on hire location  are capitalized 
we charge repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the lives of the assets as incurred and include these costs in direct operating expenses 

table of contents an allowance is provided through direct operating expenses based on the net book value of a percentage of the units on lease to certain customers that are considered to be non performing which we believe we will not ultimately recover 
the percentage is developed based on historical experience 
equipment held for sale in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 equipment held for sale is carried at the lower of its fair value  based on current transactions  less costs to sell or carrying value  depreciation on such assets is halted and disposals generally occur within ninety days 
subsequent changes to the asset s fair value  either increases or decreases  are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the equipment held for sale  however  any such adjustments would not exceed the equipment s carrying value at the time it was initially classified as held for sale 
initial write downs of assets held for sale are recorded as an impairment charge and are included in net loss gain on sale of leasing equipment 
realized gains and losses resulting from the sale of equipment held for sale are recorded as a net gain loss on sale of leasing equipment 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is updated on a regular basis and is based upon a review of the collectibility of our receivables 
this review considers the risk profile of the customer  credit quality indicators such as the level of past due amounts and economic conditions 
an account is considered past due when a payment has not been received in accordance with the contractual terms 
accounts are generally charged off after an analysis is completed which indicates that collection of the full principal balance is in doubt 
changes in economic conditions or other events may necessitate additions or deductions to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to provide for losses inherent in our receivables  and requires the application of estimates and judgments as to the outcome of collection efforts and the realization of collateral  among other things 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to provide for credit losses inherent in our existing receivables 
however  actual losses could exceed the amounts provided for in certain periods 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  sfas no 

under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between our financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangibles we evaluate our goodwill balance for possible impairment annually  in the fourth quarter of each year 
a review of goodwill may also be initiated if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired 
in performing this evaluation management may consider many factors including projected future operating results and cash flows  economic trends and other market place data 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
under sfas no 
 there is now a common definition of fair value to be used throughout gaap 
the new 
table of contents standard will make the measurement of fair value more consistent and comparable and improve disclosures about those measures 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
during the first fiscal year beginning after november  the company is currently evaluating sfas no 
 and does not believe it will have any impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of fin effective january  management does not expect any significant impact to its consolidated results of operations and financial position 
this estimate is subject to change as management finalizes its analysis

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in results of our operations and cash flows 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency  interest rate  and credit risks 
foreign currency exchange rate risk although we have significant foreign based operations  the us dollar is the operating currency for the majority of our leases both customers obligations and company obligations  and most of our revenues and expenses in fiscal years and were denominated in us dollars 
as a result  foreign currency fluctuations did not materially impact our financial results in those periods 
interest rate risk we enter into interest rate swap contracts to fix the interest rates on a portion of our debt 
we assess and manage the external and internal risk associated with these derivative instruments in accordance with our overall operating goals 
external risk is defined as those risks outside of our direct control  including counterparty credit risk  liquidity risk  systemic risk and legal risk 
internal risk relates to those operational risks within the management oversight structure and includes actions taken in contravention of our policy 
the primary external risk of our interest rate swap contracts is counterparty credit exposure  which is defined as the ability of a counterparty to perform its financial obligations under a derivative contract 
all derivative agreements are with major money center financial institutions rated investment grade by nationally recognized rating agencies  with our counterparties rated a or better 
credit exposures are measured based on the market value of outstanding derivative instruments 
both current exposures and potential exposures are calculated for each derivative contract to monitor counterparty credit exposure 

table of contents as of december   the company had in place interest rate swap contracts to fix the floating interest rates on a portion of the borrowings under its debt facilities as summarized below

interest rate swap is euro denominated and based on month euribor  and has been converted to us dollars using the exchange rate at december  changes in the fair value on these interest rate swap contracts will be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains or losses on interest rate swaps 
as a result of our variable rate indebtedness  our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates 
however  we utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage the market risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates 
if market interest rates for our variable rate indebtedness averaged basis points more than the weighted average interest rate actually paid during  our interest expense  after considering the effects of our interest rate swap agreements  would have increased  and income before incomes taxes would have decreased  by million for the year ended december  these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowings and interest rate swap ag reements
