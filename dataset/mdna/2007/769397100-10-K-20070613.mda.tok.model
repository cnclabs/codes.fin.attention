item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto contained in item of this form k and the other sections contained in this form k 
critical accounting policies the company has established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified three policies  that due to judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements 
these policies relate to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of the mortgage servicing rights msr s and the impairment of investments 
these policies and the judgments  estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail in subsequent sections of management s discussions and analysis contained herein and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
in particular  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  describes generally the company s accounting policies and note  mortgage servicing rights provides details used in valuing the company s msr s and the effect of changes to certain assumptions 
management believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time 
however  given the sensitivity of the company s consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies  the use of other judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in the company s results of operations or financial condition 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for probable loan losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is provided based upon management s continuing analysis of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  current economic conditions  and detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured 
the detailed analysis includes techniques to estimate the fair value of loan collateral and the existence of potential alternative sources of repayment 
the appropriate allowance level is estimated based upon factors and trends identified by management at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
mortgage servicing rights the company stratifies its msr s based on the predominant characteristics of the underlying financial assets including coupon interest rate and contractual maturity of the mortgage 
an estimated fair value of msr s is determined quarterly using a discounted cash flow model 
the model estimates the present value of the future net cash flows of the servicing portfolio based on various factors  such as servicing costs  servicing income  expected prepayments speeds  discount rate  loan maturity and interest rate 
the effect of changes in market interest rates on estimated rates of loan prepayments represents the predominant risk characteristic underlying the msr s portfolio 
the company s methodology for estimating the fair value of msr s is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions 
for example  the determination of fair value uses anticipated prepayment speeds 
actual prepayment experience may differ and any difference may have a material effect on the fair value 
thus  any measurement of msr s fair value is limited by the conditions existing and assumptions made as of the date made 
those assumptions may not be appropriate if they are applied to a different time 
future expected net cash flows from servicing a loan in the servicing portfolio would not be realized if the loan were paid off earlier than anticipated 
moreover  since most loans within the servicing portfolio do not contain penalty provisions for early payoff  the company will not receive a corresponding economic benefit if the loan pays off earlier than expected 
msr s are the discounted present value of the future net cash flows projected from the servicing portfolio 
accordingly  prepayment risk subjects the company s msr s to impairment 
msr s impairment is recorded in the amount that the estimated fair value is less than the msr s carrying value on a strata by strata basis 
investment valuation the company s determination of impairment for various types of investments accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
is predicated on the notion of other than temporary 
the key indicator that an investment may be impaired is that the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value 
each reporting period  the company reviews those investments where the fair value is less than carrying value 
the review includes determining whether certain indicators indicated the fair value of the investment has been negatively impacted 
these indicators include deteriorating financial condition  regulatory  economic or technological changes  downgrade by a rating agency and length of time the fair value has been less than carrying value 
if any indicators of impairment are present  management determines the fair value of the investment and compares this to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment  the investment is considered impaired and a determination must be made as to whether the impairment is other than temporary 
securities held to maturity are carried at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts  which are recognized in interest income using the interest method 
if the cost basis of these securities is determined to be other than temporary impaired  the amount of the impairment is charged to operations 
securities available for sale are carried at fair value 
premiums and discounts are amortized using the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity 
unrealized holding gains and losses  or valuation allowances established for net unrealized losses  are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of income taxes  unless the security is deemed other than temporary impaired 
if the security is determined to be other than temporary impaired  the amount of the impairment is charged to operations 
the company s underlying principle in determining whether impairment is other than temporary is an impairment shall be deemed other than temporary unless positive evidence indicating that an investment s carrying value is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs negative evidence to the contrary 
evidence that is objectively determinable and verifiable is given greater weight than evidence that is subjective and or not verifiable 
evidence based on future events will generally be less objective as it is based on future expectations and therefore is generally less verifiable or not verifiable at all 
factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary include  a the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost  b the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and c the company s intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time 
in situations in which the security s fair value is below amortized cost but it continues to be probable that all contractual terms of the security will be satisfied  and that the decline is solely attributable to changes in interest rates not because of increased credit risk  and the company asserts that it has positive intent and ability to hold that security to maturity  no other than temporary impairment is recognized 
operating strategy in the fiscal year ended march   the company began to implement a growth strategy to broaden its products and services from those of a traditional thrift to those more closely related to commercial banking 
the growth strategy included four elements geographic and product expansion  loan portfolio diversification  development of relationship banking and maintenance of asset quality 
the april acquisition of apb added three branches in oregon portland  aumsville and wood village 
fiscal year expansion also included opening in vancouver the riverview center an operations center and the tech center branch 
the riverview center is a  square foot office building  over employees from accounting  audit  data processing  human resources  information technology  loan origination  loan servicing  marketing and operations are located here 
the tech center is a full service branch with the convenience of two drive up teller windows  drive up atm and safe deposit boxes 
during fiscal year the company opened a new full service branch and commercial lending center gateway branch in portland  oregon 
the number of automated teller machines increased from six at march  to at march  so that each branch location now is serviced by at least one automated teller machine 
the company s growing commercial customer base has enjoyed new products and the improvements in existing products 
these new products include business checking  internet banking and new loan products 
retail customers have benefited from expanded choices ranging from additional automated teller machines  consumer lending products  checking accounts  debit cards  hour account information service and internet banking 
fiscal marked the th anniversary since the bank opened its doors in the historical emphasis has been on residential real estate lending  however  the company began diversifying its loan portfolio through the expansion of commercial loans in at march   commercial and construction loans as a percentage of the loan portfolio were  which has increased to of total loans at the end of fiscal year commercial lending including commercial real estate has higher credit risk  wider interest margins and shorter loan terms than residential lending which can increase the loan portfolio s profitability 
the company s relationship banking has been enhanced by the addition of riverview asset management corp  a trust company directed by experienced trust officers  through expanded loan products serviced by experienced commercial and consumer lending officers  and an expanded branch network led by experienced branch managers 
development of relationship banking has been the key to the company s growth 
the fair market value of assets under management in riverview asset management corp 
has increased from million at march   to million at march  net interest income the company s profitability depends primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the income it receives on interest earning assets and its cost of funds  which consists of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is also affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
when interest earning assets equal or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
the level of non interest income and expenses also affects the company s profitability 
non interest income includes deposit service fees  income associated with the origination and sale of mortgage loans  brokering loans  loan servicing fees  income from real estate owned  net gains and losses on sales of interest earning assets  bank owned life insurance income and asset management fee income 
non interest expenses include compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  deposit insurance premiums  data servicing expenses and other operating costs 
the company s results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government legislation and regulation  and monetary and fiscal policies 
comparison of financial condition at march  and at march   the company had total assets of million compared with million at march  the increase in total assets was primarily as a result of the increase in the balance of loans outstanding 
loans receivable  net  was million at march   compared to million at march   a increase 
the million increase reflects increases in all loan categories except other installment 
the national and local economy both are experiencing slower growth and this has reduced the demand for the bank s loans particularly during the fourth quarter of fiscal year in the first quarter of fiscal year the bank has implemented a strategy to increase the amount of resources available to attract more loans 
a substantial portion of the company s loan portfolio is secured by real estate  either as primary or secondary collateral located in its primary market areas 
cash  including interest earning accounts  totaled million at march   compared to million at march   as a result of the company s increase in total loans 
investment securities available for sale were million at march   compared to million at march  the decrease was attributable to maturities and scheduled cash flows 
mortgage backed securities held to maturity was million at march   compared to million at march  the decrease is attributable to maturities and scheduled cash flows 
mortgage backed securities available for sale were million at march   compared to million at march  the million decrease was a result of pay downs 
deposit accounts totaled million at march  compared to million at march  the increase in deposits is a result of increase in money market and now accounts 
checking accounts and money market accounts total average outstanding balance increased to million at march   compared to million at march  transaction accounts represented and of average total outstanding balance of deposits at march  and march   respectively 
the increase in money market deposits resulted from making available an existing money market product to all the bank s branches whereas prior only a select few branches offered this money market product 
fhlb advances decreased to million at march  as compared to million at march  the decrease reflects the growth in deposits 
shareholders equity increased million to million at march  from million at march  the increase was primarily the result of million total comprehensive income   earned esop shares and  received from the exercise of stock options and partially offset by million cash dividends paid to shareholders 
comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and net income 
net income was million  or per diluted earning share for the year ended march   compared to million  or per diluted share for the year ended march  the increase resulted from an increase in interest income and non interest income partially offset by increases in interest expense and non interest expense 
net interest income 
net interest income for fiscal year was million  representing a million  or a increase  from million in fiscal year this improvement reflected a increase in the average balance of interest earning assets to million  which was offset by a increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities an increase in all deposit categories except savings accounts  to million 
the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal which indicates that the interest earning asset growth is being funded more by interest bearing liabilities as compared to capital and non interest bearing demand deposits 
interest income 
interest income was million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to million  for the fiscal year ended march  increased interest income is the result of the increase in the average balance of interest earning assets and the increased yield on interest earning assets 
average interest bearing assets increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the yield on interest earning assets was for fiscal year compared to for fiscal the increased yield is primarily the result of the higher yields on loans  investment securities and other interest earning assets reflecting the increasing interest rate environment 
the increased interest income is the result of the increase in the average balance of interest earning assets and the increase in the yield on interest earning assets 
interest expense 
interest expense for the fiscal year ended march  totaled million  a million or increase from million for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in interest expense is the result of higher rates of interest paid on deposits and borrowings that occurred during fiscal years and the weighted average interest rate of total deposits increased from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  the weighted average interest rate of fhlb borrowings increased from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  the mix of deposits has changed as the interest rates on deposit accounts have increased 
there is an increased demand for higher yielding money market accounts which is reflected in the growth of total average money market accounts in fiscal year to million compared to million in fiscal year growth in loans in fiscal year was supported by the increased average total fhlb seattle borrowings of million for the fiscal year compared to million for the fiscal year provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses for fiscal year was million  compared to million for the same period in the prior year 
management analyzes the probable loss factors that drive the loan loss reserve on a quarterly basis 
these probable loss factors contemplate historical loss rates  adjusted for qualitative factors that are included in our analysis 
such factors include the relative strength of the local economy  concentrations in certain categories  such as commercial real estate and construction loans  the impact of an increasing interest rate environment along with other factors 
as part of that ongoing process  the company has continued to refine its reserving methodologies with regard to larger and or high risk loans that we consider to be non homogeneous  such as commercial  speculative  and commercial construction loans 
these refinements  which primarily included the improved methodology of calculating required allowance for loan losses based on loan purpose  have improved the determination of the required allowance for loan losses 
during the fiscal year ended march   management evaluated known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio and changes were made in the estimation  assumptions and allocation of the allowance for loan losses to reflect the changing housing market 
the national and local economy housing market is experiencing a slow down in housing sales which has impacted land developers and housing contractors ability to sell their products 
the estimated loan loss rate was increased by to for the loans consisting of land and lots for development  speculative construction loans and raw land loans 
such changes resulted in approximately  of increased provision for the fiscal year ended march  the stable loan loss provision for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the prior year was due to a combination of increased loan loss rates offset by the decreased loan charge offs  smaller loan growth experienced during the year ended march  as well as the refinement in determining the required allowance for loan loss based on loan purpose 
net recoveries for the year ended march  were  compared to net charge offs of  for the same period of last year 
annualized net recoveries to average net loans for the year ended march  was compared to annualized net charge offs of for the same period in the prior year 
non accrual loans continued to decrease from  at march  to  at march  the allowance for loan losses was million at march  compared to million at march  the quality of the loan portfolio continues to be very stable  as the classified substandard loan balances have increased just  and non accrual loans decreased by  at march  compared to march  the ratio of allowance for credit losses and loan commitments to total net loans at march  increased to from at march  with such increase reflecting the changing loan balance  mix of the company s loan portfolio and the additional risk of these loans as described above 
non interest income 
non interest income increased  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the same period in primarily as a result of a  increase in asset management fees 
the increase in asset management fees reflects the increase in assets under management by riverview asset management corp 
from million at march  to million at march  the  decrease in fees and service charges reflects the  decrease in credit card fees resulting from the sale of the credit card portfolio in the second quarter of fiscal the decrease in credit card fees was partially offset by increases in fees earned on deposit accounts and broker loan fees 
the increase in loan servicing income for fiscal year includes the  decrease in servicing amortization as the servicing portfolio has decreased 
mortgage brokered loan production decreased from million during the year ended march  to million during the year ended march  mortgage broker fees included in fees and service charges totaled million for the year ended march  compared to million for the previous year 
mortgage broker commission compensation expense was million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  non interest expense 
non interest expense increased  million  or  to million for fiscal year ended march  compared to million for fiscal year ended march  the principal component of the increase in the company s non interest expense was salaries and employee benefits 
for the year ended march   salaries and employee benefits  which includes mortgage broker commission compensation  was million  a increase over the prior year total of million 
salaries increased as the number of full time equivalent employees increased to at march  from at march   which was primarily the result of the expansion related to increased staffing in branches and operations 
one measure of a bank s ability to contain non interest expense is the efficiency ratio  which is calculated by dividing total non interest expense less intangible asset amortization by the sum of net interest income plus non interest income less intangible asset amortization  lower of cost or market adjustments and securities impairment charge 
the company s efficiency ratio excluding intangible asset amortization  lower of cost or market adjustments and securities impairment charge was in fiscal compared to in fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal year  the current esop expiration date was extended from december  to december  this extension resulted in the third quarter reduction of esop expense of  reflecting the release of  esop shares to the esop participants at december  the acquisition of apb and the related acquisition of million in deposit accounts created a  core deposit intangible cdi representing the excess of cost over fair market value of the acquired deposits 
the cdi is being amortized over a ten year life using an accelerated method 
the amortization expense was  for fiscal  compared to  in fiscal the acquisition of today s bancorp and the related acquisition of million in deposit accounts created an  cdi 
the cdi is being amortized over a ten year life using an accelerated amortization method 
the amortization expense was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million for the year ended march  compared to million for the year ended march  the primary reason the tax provision is higher in the current year compared to the prior year is a result of the higher income in the current year 
the effective tax rate for fiscal year was compared to for fiscal the primary reason for the increase in the effective tax rate was the entry into a new tax jurisdiction including the state of oregon and multnomah county in oregon 
reference is made to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k  for further discussion of the company s income taxes 
comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and net income 
net income was million  or per diluted earning share for the year ended march   compared to million  or per diluted share for the year ended march  net interest income 
net interest income for fiscal year was million  representing a million  or a increase  from million in fiscal year this improvement reflected a increase in the average balance of interest earning assets primarily as a result of increases in the average balance of mortgage and non mortgage loans due primarily to the apb acquisition  partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of mortgage backed and investment securities and daily interest bearing assets to million  which was offset by a increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities an increase in all deposit categories reflecting deposits assumed as part of the apb acquisition and a million increase in average fhlb borrowings to million 
the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal which indicates that the interest earning asset growth is being funded more by interest bearing liabilities as compared to capital and non interest bearing demand deposits 
interest income 
interest income was million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to million  for the fiscal year ended increased interest income is the result of the increase in the average balance of interest earning assets and the increased yield on interest earning assets 
average interest bearing assets increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the yield on interest earning assets was for fiscal year compared to for fiscal the increased yield isprimarily the result of the higher yields on loans  investment securities and other interest earning assets reflecting the increasing interest rate environment 
the increased interest income is the result of the increase in the average balance of interest earning assets and the increase in the yield on interest earning assets 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended march  totaled million  a million increase from million for the year ended march  the increase in interest expense is the result of higher rates of interest that occurred during fiscal years and the weighted average interest rate of total deposits increased from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  the weighted average interest rate of fhlb borrowings decreased from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses for fiscal year was million  compared to  for the same period in the prior year 
for this time period the loan receivable balance increased million to million at march  from million at march  excluding the impact of the american pacific bank acquisition  organic loan growth during the fiscal year was million  consisting primarily of commercial and construction loans 
management analyzes the probable loss factors that drive the loan loss reserve on a quarterly basis 
these probable loss factors contemplate historical loss rates  adjusted for qualitative factors that are included in the company s analysis 
such factors include the relative strength of the local economy  concentrations in certain categories  such as commercial real estate and construction loans  the impact of an increasing interest rate environment  as well as the overall impact of integrating apb s lending business with ours  along with other factors 
as part of that ongoing process  we have continued to refine the company s reserving methodologies with regard to larger and or high risk loans that we consider to be nonhomogeneous  such as commercial  speculative  and commercial construction loans 
such loans have continued to be an increasing part of the company s loan portfolio in recent quarters  which tends to result in an increased loan loss requirement 
for example  as a percentage of total loans  the company s other real estate mortgage loans increased from to and construction loans from to at march  as compared to march  based on the company s continuing analysis of these loans  we increased certain loss factors assigned to some of these loan categories during the current fiscal year 
for example  the estimated loan loss rate for land and lots for development was increased by to  commercial real estate loans was increased by to  commercial construction loans was increased by to  speculative construction loans was increased by to  multi family loans was increased by to and raw land and lots was increased by to to cover the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
such changes resulted in approximately  of increased provision for the fiscal year of the increased loan loss provision during the fiscal year was due to this combination of loan growth  as well as the higher percentage of loans falling into higher risk categories 
net charge offs to average net loans was for fiscal year as compared to for prior year 
non accrual loans continued to decrease from  at march  to  at march  the allowance for loan losses was million at march  compared to million at march  the quality of the loan portfolio continues to be very good  as the criticized classified loan balances have increased just  and non accrual loans decreased by  at march  compared to march  net charge offs for the twelve months ended march  were  compared to  for the same period of last year 
the ratio of allowance for credit losses and loan commitments to total net loans at march  increased to from at march  with such increase reflecting the changing mix of the company s loan portfolio and the additional risk of these loans as described above 
management believes that its allowance for loan losses as of march  was adequate to absorb the known and inherent risks of loss in the loan portfolio at that date 
while management believes the estimates and assumptions used in its determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable  there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future  or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the determination of the amount of the bank s allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators  as part of the routine examination process  which may result in the establishment of additional reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the same period in primarily as a result of a million increase in fees and service charges  an increase of  in asset management fees and the non recurring  gain on sale of the credit card portfolio acquired in the apb acquisition 
the million increase in fees and service charges was primarily a result of the  or growth in mortgage broker fees and the acquisition of apb in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase in loan servicing income for fiscal year reflects the  decrease in servicing amortization as the servicing portfolio has decreased 
for the year ended march   fees and service charges increased million  or  when compared to the year ended march  the increase in the number of mortgage brokers from to in fiscal year combined with the increasing mortgage interest rates experienced in fiscal increased the volume of mortgage refinance activity as compared to fiscal the increased mortgage refinance activity resulted in increased mortgage broker activity 
the reduced gains on sale of loans held for sale reflected the mortgage broker activity having a higher proportion of brokered loans versus portfolio loans 
mortgage brokered loan production increased from million in to million in mortgage broker fees included in fees and service charges totaled million for the year ended march  compared to million for the previous year 
mortgage broker commission compensation expense was million for the fiscal ended march  compared to million for the fiscal ended march  asset management services income increased million reflecting the increase in assets under management for the fiscal year compared to million for the fiscal year riverview asset management corp 
had million in total assets under management at march  compared to million at march  non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year one measure of a bank s ability to contain non interest expense is the efficiency ratio  which is calculated by dividing total non interest expense less intangible asset amortization by the sum of net interest income plus non interest income less intangible asset amortization  lower of cost or market adjustments and securities impairment charge 
the company s efficiency ratio excluding intangible asset amortization  lower of cost or market adjustments and securities impairment charge was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the principal component of the increase in the company s non interest expense is salaries and employee benefits 
for the year ended march   salaries and employee benefits  which includes mortgage broker commission compensation  was million  a increase over the prior year total of million 
salaries increased as the number of full time equivalent employees increased to at march  from at march   which was primarily the result of the expansion related to increased staffing in branches and operations 
the acquisition of apb and the related acquisition of million in deposit accounts created a  core deposit intangible cdi representing the excess of cost over fair market value of the acquired deposits 
the cdi is being amortized over a ten year life using an accelerated method 
the amortization expense was  for fiscal  compared to none in fiscal the acquisition of today s bancorp and the related acquisition of million in deposit accounts created an  cdi

the amortization expense was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the acquisition of the hazel dell and longview branches from the resolution trust corporation in fiscal see item properties  and the related acquisition of million in customer deposits created a million core deposit intangible asset  representing the excess of fair value of deposits over the acquired cost 
cdi was  at march  and was fully amortized during the fiscal year the amortization expense of cdi was  for the fiscal year provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million for the year ended march  compared to million for the year ended march  the primary reason the tax provision is higher in the current year compared to the prior year is a result of the higher income in the current year

the company has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in market interest rates by attempting to manage the difference between asset and liability maturities and interest rates 
the principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity increases by retaining portfolio loans with interest rates subject to periodic adjustment to market conditions and selling fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans with terms to maturity of more than years 
the company relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds 
management believes retail deposits reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a stable source of funds 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  the company promotes transaction accounts and certificates of deposit with terms up to ten years 
the company has adopted a strategy that is designed to maintain or improve the interest rate sensitivity of assets relative to its liabilities 
the primary elements of this strategy involve the origination of adjustable rate loans or purchase of adjustable rate mortgage backed securities for its portfolio  increasing commercial  consumer loans that are adjustable rate and short term loans and residential construction loans as a portion of total net loans receivable because of their generally shorter terms and higher yields than other one to four family residential mortgage loans  matching asset and liability maturities  investing in short term securities  and the origination of fixed rate loans for sale in the secondary market and the retention of the related loan servicing rights 
the strategy for liabilities has been to shorten the maturities for both deposits and borrowings 
this approach has remained consistent throughout the past year  as the company has experienced a change in the mix of loans  deposits and fhlb advances 
at march   adjustable rate loans and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities constituted million  or  of the company s total combined loans and securities portfolio 
this compares to adjustable rate loans and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities at march  that totaled million  or  of the company s total combined loan and securities portfolio 
although the company has sought to originate adjustable rate loans  the ability to originate and purchase such loans depends to a great extent on market interest rates and borrowers preferences 
particularly in lower interest rate environments  borrowers often prefer to obtain fixed rate loans 
the company s mortgage servicing activities provide additional protection from interest rate risk 
the company retains servicing rights on all mortgage loans sold 
as market interest rates rise  the fixed rate loans held in portfolio diminish in value 
however  the value of the servicing portfolio tends to rise as market interest rates increase because borrowers tend not to prepay the underlying mortgages  thus providing an interest rate risk hedge versus the fixed rate loan portfolio 
the mortgage loan servicing portfolio totaled million at march   including million of purchased mortgage servicing 
the purchase of loan servicing replaced loan servicing balances extinguished through prepayment of the underlying loans 
the average balance of the servicing portfolio was million and produced loan servicing income of  for the year ended march  see item business lending activities mortgage loan servicing 
consumer loans  such as home equity line of credit and installment  commercial loans and construction loans typically have shorter terms and higher yields than permanent residential mortgage loans  and accordingly reduce the company s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates

a measure of the company s exposure to differential changes in interest rates between assets and liabilities is provided by the test required by ots thrift bulletin no 
a  interest rate risk management 
this test measures the impact on net interest income and on net portfolio value of an immediate change in interest rates in basis point increments 
using data compiled by the ots  the company receives a report that measures interest rate risk by modeling the change in net portfolio value npv over a variety of interest rate scenarios 
this procedure for measuring interest rate risk was developed by the ots to replace the gap analysis the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice within a specific time period 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
the following table provides the estimated impacts of immediate changes in interest rates at the specified levels based on the latest ots report dated december  at december  net portfolio value net portfolio value as a percent of present value of assets change dollar dollar percent in rates amount change change npv ratio change dollars in thousands bp   bp bp  bp bp  bp bp  bp   bp bp   bp for example  the above table illustrates that an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates at december  would increase the company s npv by approximately  or  at that date 
at december   an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates would have increased the company s npv by approximately million  or  at that date 
the million increase in the npv to million at december  from million at december  is the result of the impact of more adjustable loan balances in the loan portfolio at december  as compared to december  the company s balance sheet continues to be to a degree asset sensitive in its balance between interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
in the current inverted flat interest rate environment there continues to be pressure on the net interest margin 
in a sustained rising interest rate environment the asset yields are expected to closely match rising funding costs 
a sustained falling interest rate environment would negatively impact net interest rate margins 
certain assumptions used by the ots in assessing the interest rate risk of savings associations within its region were used in preparing the preceding table 
these assumptions relate to interest rates  loan prepayment rates  deposit decay rates and the market values of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios  among others 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
furthermore  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of cash flows is its operations as a lender  which generates interest income on loans 
this is supplemented by fee income  service charges  and interest on investment securities  and reduced by payment of interest expense and non interest expenses 
after payment of expenses  the company has significant positive cash flow from operating activities 
the company s investing activities typically use cash  primarily for loan originations 
for the year ended march  additional cash flows were provided by the company s financing activities as a result of a significant increase in deposit accounts 
for the year ended march  the increase in deposit accounts reflects the acquisition of apb million in deposits 
the company s primary source of funds are customer deposits  proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans  the sale of loans  maturing securities and fhlb advances 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the company must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to fund loan originations and deposit withdrawals  satisfy other financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities 
the company generally maintains sufficient cash and short term investments to meet short term liquidity needs 
at march   cash totaled million  or  of total assets 
the bank has a of total assets line of credit with the fhlb of seattle to the extent the bank provides qualifying collateral and holds sufficient fhlb stock 
at march  the bank had million of outstanding advances from the fhlb of seattle under an available credit facility of million  limited to available collateral 
liquidity management is both a short and long term responsibility of the company s management 
the company adjusts its investments in liquid assets based upon management s assessment of i expected loan demand  ii projected loan sales  iii expected deposit flows  iv yields available on interest bearing deposits and v its asset liability management program objectives 
excess liquidity is invested generally in interest bearing overnight deposits and other short term government and agency obligations 
if the company requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  it has additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb and collateral for borrowing at the federal reserve bank discount window

the bank s primary sources of funds are deposits  fhlb borrowings  proceeds from the principal and interest payments on loans and securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows  prepayment of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the increase in interest rates during the fiscal year ended march  has created an interest rate environment that caused the demand for fixed rate one to four family loans and repayment of existing one to four family mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities to be less than in the prior year 
the company s business plan emphasizes the sale of fixed rate mortgages as part of its interest rate risk strategy 
the decrease in the cash flows from operating activities of loans sold to million for the fiscal compared to million for fiscal reflects this strategy under the changing interest rate environment 
the bank has experienced growth in deposit accounts that is attributable to organic growth through operations 
the information contained in item  business deposit activities and other sources of funds deposit flow reflects this net increase in cash flows from deposits of million for fiscal as compared to a million increase in net cash flows for the same period in the prior year which included million of deposits acquired in the apb acquisition

effect of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services

the bank has entered into employment contracts with certain key employees  which provide for contingent payment subject to future events 
off balance sheet arrangements the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments generally include commitments to originate mortgage  commercial and consumer loans 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the company s maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the borrower is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
commitments to extend credit are conditional  and are honored for up to days subject to the company s usual terms and conditions 
collateral is not required to support commitments 
at march   the company had commitments to extend credit of million  compared to million at march  the million decrease in commitments to extend credit has been experienced in all loan categories 
these decreases reflect the changes in the us economy and are not due to local economic changes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative aspects of market risk 
the company does not maintain a trading account for any class of financial instrument nor does it engage in hedging activities or purchase high risk derivative instruments 
furthermore  the company is not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk

qualitative aspects of market risk 
the company s principal financial objective is to achieve long term profitability while limiting its exposure to fluctuating market interest rates 
the company intends to reduce risk where appropriate but accept a degree of risk when warranted by economic circumstances 
the company has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in market interest rates by attempting to manage the mismatch between asset and liability maturities and interest rates 
the principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the company s interest earning assets 
interest rate sensitivity will increase by retaining portfolio loans with interest rates subject to periodic adjustment to market conditions and selling fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans with terms of more than years 
interest rates on residential one to four family mortgage loan applications are typically locked during the application stage for periods ranging from to days  the most typical period being days 
these loans are locked with the fhlmc under a best efforts delivery program 
the company makes every effort to deliver these loans before their rate locks expire 
this arrangement requires the company to deliver the loans to the fhlmc within ten days of funding 
delays in funding the loans can require a lock extension 
the cost of a lock extension at times is borne by the borrower and at times by the company 
these lock extension costs paid by the company are not expected to have a material impact to operations 
this activity is managed daily 
consumer and commercial loans are originated and held in portfolio as the short term nature of these portfolio loans match durations more closely with the short term nature of retail deposits such as interest checking  money market accounts and savings accounts 
the company relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds 
management believes retail deposits reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a more stable source of funds 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  the company promotes transaction accounts and certificates of deposit with longer terms to maturity 
except for immediate short term cash needs  and depending on the current interest rate environment  fhlb advances will have maturities of long or short term
