item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and the financial condition of our business during each of the fiscal years in the three year period ended december  overview we are a leading independent manufacturer and distributor of replacement parts for motor vehicles in the automotive aftermarket industry 
we are organized into two major operating segments  each of which focuses on a specific segment of replacement parts 
our engine management segment manufactures ignition and emission parts  on board computers  ignition wires  battery cables and fuel system parts 
our temperature control segment manufactures and remanufactures air conditioning compressors  and other air conditioning and heating parts 
we sell our products primarily in the united states  canada and latin america 
we also sell our products in europe through our european segment 
as part of our efforts to grow our business  as well as to achieve increased production and distribution efficiencies  in june we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the operating liabilities of dana corporation s engine management group dem 
under the terms of the acquisition  we paid dana corporation million in cash  issued an unsecured promissory note of million  and issued  shares of our common stock valued at million 
including transaction costs  our total purchase price was approximately million 
in december  we entered into a repurchase and prepayment agreement with dana  in which we repurchased the  shares of our common stock at a repurchase price of per share or an aggregate approximate repurchase price of million and prepaid at a discount the million unsecured promissory note plus accrued and unpaid interest for an aggregate approximate amount of million 
we recognized the discount of million as a gain on the repayment of the note as well as the unrecognized deferred interest expense thereon of million as income in in connection with the dem acquisition  we reviewed our operations and implemented integration plans to restructure the operations of dem 
at the time  we announced that we would close seven dem facilities  which has subsequently occurred 
as part of the integration and restructuring plans  we accrued an initial restructuring liability of approximately million at june  such amounts were recognized as liabilities assumed in the acquisition and included in the allocation of the cost to acquire dem 
accordingly  such amounts resulted in additional goodwill being recorded in connection with the acquisition 
subsequent to the acquisition  our estimate of the restructuring liability was updated and revised downward at various points in time  with a cumulative reduction to goodwill of million as of december  as of december   the remaining restructuring accrual was million 
we expect to pay most of the remaining amount in and of the initial restructuring accrual  approximately million related to work force reductions and represented employee termination benefits 
the accrual amount primarily provides for severance costs relating to the involuntary termination of employees  individually employed throughout dem s facilities across a broad range of functions  including managerial  professional  clerical  manufacturing and factory positions 
during the years ended december  and  termination benefits of million and million  respectively  have been charged to the restructuring accrual 
as of december   the reserve balance for workforce reductions was million 
the initial restructuring accrual also included approximately million consisting of the net present value of costs associated with exiting certain activities  primarily related to lease and contract termination costs  which will not have future benefits 
specifically  our plans were to consolidate certain of dem operations into our existing plants 
at december   we had a sublease commitment for one facility with dana through however  on march   dana filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
pursuant to a court ruling in connection with dana s chapter bankruptcy proceedings  effective march   we were released from  and no longer have any obligations with respect to  such lease commitment for the facility 
we have accounted for the termination of such lease commitment as a reduction of million in our restructuring accrual  with a corresponding reduction to goodwill established on the acquisition of dem 
in addition to the above reduction  exit costs of million were paid as of december   leaving the exit reserve balance for exit costs at million as of december  for additional information about our business  strategy and competitive environment  see item  business 
seasonality 
historically  our operating results have fluctuated by quarter  with the greatest sales occurring in the second and third quarters of the year and revenues generally being recognized at the time of shipment 
it is in these quarters that demand for our products is typically the highest  specifically in the temperature control segment of our business 
in addition to this seasonality  the demand for our temperature control products during the second and third quarters of the year may vary significantly with the summer weather and customer inventories 
for example  a cool summer may lessen the demand for our temperature control products  while a hot summer may increase such demand 
as a result of this seasonality and variability in demand of our temperature control products  our working capital requirements peak near the end of the second quarter  as the inventory build up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales have yet to be received 
during this period  our working capital requirements are typically funded by borrowing from our revolving credit facility 
the seasonality of our business offers significant operational challenges in our manufacturing and distribution functions 
to limit these challenges and to provide a rapid turnaround time of customer orders  we traditionally offer a pre season selling program  known as our spring promotion  in which customers are offered longer payment terms 
inventory management 
we face inventory management issues as a result of warranty and overstock returns 
many of our products carry a warranty ranging from a day limited warranty to a lifetime limited warranty  which generally covers defects in materials or workmanship and failure to meet industry published specifications 
in addition to warranty returns  we also permit our customers to return products to us within customer specific limits which are generally limited to a specified percentage of their annual purchases from us in the event that they have overstocked their inventories 
the company accrues for overstock returns as a percentage of sales  after giving consideration to recent returns history 
in addition  the seasonality of our temperature control segment requires that we increase our inventory during the winter season in preparation of the summer selling season and customers purchasing such inventory have the right to make returns 
in order to better control warranty and overstock return levels  we tightened the rules for authorized warranty returns  placed further restrictions on the amounts customers can return and instituted a program so that our management can better estimate potential future product returns 
in addition  with respect to our air conditioning compressors  our most significant customer product warranty returns  we established procedures whereby a warranty will be voided if a customer does not provide acceptable proof that complete ac system repair was performed 
discounts  allowances and incentives 
in connection with our sales activities  we offer a variety of usual customer discounts  allowances and incentives 
first  we offer cash discounts for paying invoices in accordance with the specified discounted terms of the invoice 
second  we offer pricing discounts based on volume and different product lines purchased from us 
these discounts are principally in the form of off invoice discounts and are immediately deducted from sales at the time of sale 
for those customers that choose to receive a payment on a quarterly basis instead of off invoice  we accrue for such payments as the related sales are made and reduce sales accordingly 
finally  rebates and discounts are provided to customers as advertising and sales force allowances  and allowances for warranty and overstock returns are also provided 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
we account for these discounts and allowances as a reduction to revenues  and record them when sales are recorded 
comparison of fiscal years and sales 
consolidated net sales for were million  a decrease of million or  compared to million in the net sales decrease was primarily due to our temperature control net sales decreasing by million or due to reduced demand resulting from a cooler summer than the prior year and competition from low cost foreign imports 
engine management net sales also decreased by million or mainly due to higher than average customer returns 
partially offsetting the decrease  net sales in europe increased million 
gross margins 
gross margins  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  increased by percentage points to in from in mainly driven by engine management margin improvements of percentage points 
the margin increase in our engine management segment reflected a combination of price increases and improved procurement and manufacturing costs 
temperature control and europe margin percentages remained stable due to improved production and procurement costs offsetting the effect of inflation 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million to million or of consolidated net sales in  compared to million or of consolidated net sales in the increase in sg a expenses was driven mainly by increases in marketing and general and administrative expenses  partially offset by a reduction of million in draft expenses as we terminated our accounts receivable draft program in the fourth quarter of and a reduction in distribution costs as a result of lower sales 
the increase in marketing expenses is due to an increase in promotion spending and temporary overlapping costs as we transitioned from an outsourced to an internal returns processing center 
the increase in general administrative expenses was mainly due to our ongoing efforts to fully integrate our operations into a common enterprise resource planning system 
restructuring expenses 
restructuring expenses  which include restructuring and integration expenses  decreased to million for  compared to million in the expenses related mostly to severance costs related to the move of our european and puerto rican production operations and the divestiture of a production unit of our temperature control segment 
expenses in were primarily for a non cash asset impairment charge of million in our temperature control business related to a strategic decision to outsource products previously manufactured  while the remainder was mostly related to the dem restructuring  which has since been substantially completed 
operating income 
operating income increased by million to million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily due to higher gross profit from engine management s point improvement in gross profit percentage  lower integration expenses and the elimination of the accounts receivable draft program fees  partially offset by higher sg a expenses 
other income  net 
other income  net decreased million in compared to  due to a million loss incurred on the sale of a majority portion of our european temperature control business  partially offset by higher foreign exchange gains 
a benefit in was from a discount of million on a debt reduction not repeated in interest expense 
interest expense increased by million for compared to due to higher average borrowings and higher borrowing costs 
the increase in average borrowings is due to the termination of our accounts receivable draft program in the fourth quarter of  as well as the funding of the repurchase of our common stock held by dana for million at that time 
income tax provision 
the income tax provision was million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to higher pre tax earnings and a higher effective rate for which was 
we had an increase in our on going tax rate primarily due to the january  expiration of section of the internal revenue code with regard to our puerto rico operations which are taxed at the us statutory rate starting in this increase was offset in by the one time impact of our puerto rico deferred tax assets becoming recoverable at the higher us tax rate 
our taxes were also higher as a result of recording a valuation allowance for the capital loss on disposition of our european temperature control business which is not expected to be recoverable in the future 
deferred tax assets of million  net of a valuation allowance of million and net of deferred tax liabilities of million  were million as of december  we have concluded that our current level of valuation allowance of million continues to be appropriate  as discussed in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the tax expense of million in on losses of million was mostly due to the recording of discrete items  namely with regards to a reduced statutory rate applicable to opening deferred tax assets and a larger increase to the tax valuation allowance 
income loss from discontinued operation 
income loss from discontinued operation  net of tax  reflects legal expenses associated with our asbestos related liability and adjustments thereto based on the information contained in the actuarial study and all other available information considered by us 
we recorded million as income and million as a loss  both net of tax  from discontinued operation for and  respectively 
the income for includes a million pre tax adjustment to reduce our indemnity liability in line with our most recent actuarial valuation report  partially offset by legal fees incurred in litigation  whereas the loss for reflects only legal expenses 
as discussed more fully in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  we are responsible for certain future liabilities relating to alleged exposure to asbestos containing products 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
during  cash provided by operations amounted to million  compared to cash used in operations of million in the year over year improvement of million is primarily attributable to a lower increase in accounts receivable of million and increased net earnings 
the greater increase in accounts receivable in was due to the end of the accounts receivable draft program in compared to when our major accounts were under the draft program 
the lower increase in accounts receivable in reflects a stabilized situation with no draft program in place 
partially offsetting these improvements was a slight increase in inventory compared to a decrease of million in  driven by our need to provide a bridge of inventory as we undergo a rationalization of our production facilities 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in the same period of the decrease of million was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of a majority portion of our european temperature control business in financing activities 
cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in the change is primarily due to repayments made on our line of credit in due to an improvement in cash provided by operating activities and a decrease in our bank overdraft balances 
the increase to our line of credit was driven by the settlement of the note held by dana and the repurchase of the common stock held by dana  which note and common stock were originally issued to dana in connection with the dem acquisition 
we are parties to an agreement with general electric capital corporation  as agent  and a syndicate of lenders for a secured revolving credit facility 
the term of the credit agreement is through and provides for a line of credit up to million 
availability under our revolving credit facility is based on a formula of eligible accounts receivable  eligible inventory and eligible fixed assets 
after taking into account outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility  there was an additional million available for us to borrow pursuant to the formula at december  our credit agreement also permits dividends and distributions by us provided specific conditions are met 
direct borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at the prime rate plus the applicable margin as defined in the credit agreement or  at our option  the libor rate plus the applicable margin as defined in the credit agreement 
borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of our assets  including accounts receivable  inventory and fixed assets  and those of certain of our subsidiaries 
the terms of our revolving credit facility provide for  among other provisions  financial covenants requiring us  on a consolidated basis to maintain specified levels of fixed charge coverage at the end of each fiscal quarter rolling twelve months through  and to limit capital expenditure levels for each fiscal year through the terms of our revolving credit facility also provide  among other things  for the prohibition of accepting drafts under our customer draft programs after november  in december  our canadian subsidiary entered into a credit agreement with ge canada finance holding company  for itself and as agent for the lenders  and gecc capital markets  inc  as lead arranger and book runner 
the credit agreement provides for  among other things  a million term loan  which term loan is guaranteed and secured by us and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries and which term loan is coterminous with the term of our revolving credit facility 
the million term loan is part of the million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
in addition  in order to facilitate the aggregate financing of the dem acquisition in june  we completed a public equity offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
we also issued to dana corporation  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million and an unsecured subordinated promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of approximately million due december  the promissory note had an interest rate of per annum for the first year  with such interest rate increasing by one half of a percentage point on each anniversary of the date of issuance 
accrued and unpaid interest was due quarterly under the promissory note 
in december  we entered into an agreement with dana  in which we repurchased the  shares of our common stock at a repurchase price of per share or an aggregate approximate repurchase price of million and prepaid at a discount the million unsecured promissory note plus accrued and unpaid interest for an aggregate approximate amount of million 
in june  we borrowed million under a mortgage loan agreement 
the loan is payable in equal monthly installments 
the loan bears interest at a fixed rate of maturing in july the mortgage loan is secured by the related building and property 
our profitability and working capital requirements are seasonal due to the sales mix of temperature control products 
our working capital requirements usually peak near the end of the second quarter  as the inventory build up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales begin to be received 
these increased working capital requirements are funded by borrowings from our lines of credit 
in and the first quarter of  we also received the benefit from accelerating accounts receivable collections from customer draft programs 
however  in the second quarter of we reduced the early monetizing of these accounts receivable under the draft program 
an amendment to our revolving credit facility in november prohibits us from accepting drafts under our customer draft programs after november  we anticipate that our present sources of funds will continue to be adequate to meet our near term needs 
in october  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million that matured in october under this agreement  we received a floating rate based on the libor interest rate  and paid a fixed rate of on the notional amount of million 
we have not entered into a new swap agreement to replace this agreement 
in july  we issued convertible debentures  payable semi annually  in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the debentures carry an interest rate of  payable semi annually 
the debentures are convertible into  shares of our common stock  and mature on july  the proceeds from the sale of the debentures were used to prepay an senior note  reduce short term bank borrowings and repurchase a portion of our common stock 
as of december   we have board authorization to repurchase additional shares at a maximum cost of million 
during  we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock

critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
you should be aware that preparation of our consolidated annual and quarterly financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we can give no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue primarily from sales of replacement parts for motor vehicles from both our engine management and temperature control segments 
we recognize revenues when products are shipped and title has been transferred to a customer  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
for some of our sales of remanufactured products  we also charge our customers a deposit for the return of a used core component which we can use in our future remanufacturing activities 
such deposit is not recognized as revenue but rather carried as a core liability 
the liability is extinguished when a core is actually returned to us 
we estimate and record provisions for cash discounts  quantity rebates  sales returns and warranties in the period the sale is recorded  based upon our prior experience and current trends 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in estimating sales returns and allowances relating to revenue recognized in any accounting period 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out basis 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost  the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined at the reporting unit level and are based upon the inventory at that location taken as a whole 
these estimates are based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
we also evaluate inventories on a regular basis to identify inventory on hand that may be obsolete or in excess of current and future projected market demand 
for inventory deemed to be obsolete  we provide a reserve on the full value of the inventory 
inventory that is in excess of current and projected use is reduced by an allowance to a level that approximates our estimate of future demand 
we utilize cores used parts in our remanufacturing processes for air conditioning compressors 
the production of air conditioning compressors involves the rebuilding of used cores  which we acquire generally either in outright purchases or from returns pursuant to an exchange program with customers 
under such exchange programs  we reduce our inventory  through a charge to cost of sales  when we sell a finished good compressor  and put back to inventory at standard cost through a credit to cost of sales the used core exchanged at the time it is eventually received from the customer 
sales returns and other allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts 
management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
at december   the allowance for sales returns was million 
similarly  management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts and for discounts was million 
new customer acquisition costs 
new customer acquisition costs refer to arrangements pursuant to which we incur change over costs to induce a new customer to switch from a competitor s brand 
in addition  change over costs include the costs related to removing the new customer s inventory and replacing it with standard motor products inventory commonly referred to as a stocklift 
new customer acquisition costs are recorded as a reduction to revenue when incurred 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be recovered  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or recovery  respectively  within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we had a valuation allowance of million  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets 
the assessment of the adequacy of our valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or we adjust these estimates in future periods for current trends or expected changes in our estimating assumptions  we may need to modify the level of valuation allowance which could materially impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review  include the following a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  b significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and c significant negative industry or economic trends 
with respect to goodwill  if necessary  we test for potential impairment in the fourth quarter of each year as part of our annual budgeting process 
we review the fair values of each of our reporting units using the discounted cash flows method and market multiples 
in the event our planning assumptions were modified resulting in impairment to our assets  we would be required to include an expense in our statement of operations  which could materially impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
retirement and post retirement medical benefits 
each year  we calculate the costs of providing retiree benefits under the provisions of sfas  employers accounting for pensions  and sfas  employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions 
the key assumptions used in making these calculations are disclosed in notes and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the most significant of these assumptions are the eligibility criteria of participants  the discount rate used to value the future obligation  expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates 
we select discount rates commensurate with current market interest rates on high quality  fixed rate debt securities 
the expected return on assets is based on our current review of the long term returns on assets held by the plans  which is influenced by historical averages 
the medical cost trend rate is based on our actual medical claims and future projections of medical cost trends 
under fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  the company has concluded that its post retirement plan is actuarially equivalent to the medicare part d benefit and accordingly recognizes subsidies from the federal government in the measurement of the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation under sfas  employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions 
in addition  in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions  in september we recognized a curtailment gain of million for our post retirement plan related to changes made to our plan  namely reducing the number of participants eligible for our plan by making all active participants hired after no longer eligible 
asbestos reserve 
we are responsible for certain future liabilities relating to alleged exposure to asbestos containing products 
in accordance with our accounting policy  our most recent actuarial study estimated a liability for settlement payments  excluding legal costs  ranging from million to million 
based on the information contained in the actuarial study and all other available information considered by us  we concluded that no amount within the range of settlement payments was more likely than any other and  therefore  recorded the low end of the range as the liability associated with future settlement payments through in our consolidated financial statements  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
legal costs  which are expensed as incurred and reported in loss from discontinued operation  are estimated to range from million to million during the same period 
we plan to perform an annual actuarial analysis during the third quarter of each year for the foreseeable future 
based on this analysis and all other available information  we will continue to reassess the recorded liability and  if deemed necessary  record an adjustment to the reserve  which will be reflected as a loss or gain from discontinued operation 
other loss reserves 
we have numerous other loss exposures  such as environmental claims  product liability and litigation 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment of risk exposure and ultimate liability 
we estimate losses using consistent and appropriate methods  however  changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded liabilities for loss 
recently issued accounting pronouncements share based payment effective january   the company adopted the provisions and accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires that stock based employee compensation be recorded as a charge to earnings 
we have adopted sfas r using a modified prospective application  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
under this application  we are required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we applied accounting principles board opinions apb no 
and related interpretations to account for our stock plans resulting in the use of the intrinsic value to value the stock 
under apb  we were not required to recognize compensation expense for the cost of stock options 
in accordance with the adoption of sfas r  we recorded stock based compensation expense for the cost of incentive stock options  restricted stock and performance based stock granted under our stock plans 
stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  was   net of tax or per basic and diluted share 
the adoption of sfas r did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operation or cash flows

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
only tax positions meeting the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of this interpretation 
fin also provides guidance on accounting for derecognition  interest and penalties  and classification and disclosure of matters related to uncertainty in income taxes 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and  as a result  is effective for our company beginning january  fin will require adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings or other components of shareholders equity in the statement of financial position for the cumulative effect of the difference in the net amount of assets and liabilities for all open tax positions at the effective date

this statement also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position  with limited exceptions 
the company adopted the recognition and related disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 prospectively  on december  the adoption of sfas resulted in an increase to total assets of million  an increase to total liabilities of million  and a decrease to shareholders equity of million 
the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after december   or for the company s year ending december  the company is presently evaluating the impact of the measurement date change  which is not expected to be material

quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements 
sab requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both an income statement rollover and balance sheet iron curtain approach and evaluate whether either approach results in a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
if prior year errors that had been previously considered immaterial now are considered material based on either approach  no restatement is required so long as management properly applied its previous approach and all relevant facts and circumstances were considered 
if prior years are not restated  the cumulative effect adjustment is recorded in opening accumulated earnings deficit as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending on or after november   which for the company is the year ending december  there was no impact of adopting sab to our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  primarily related to foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
these exposures are actively monitored by management 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs  revenues and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than one of our subsidiary s functional currency 
similarly  we are exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of our financing 
it is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
exchange rate risk we have exchange rate exposure primarily with respect to the canadian dollar  the british pound  the euro  the japanese yen and the hong kong dollar 
as of december   our monetary assets and liabilities which are subject to this exposure are immaterial  therefore the potential immediate loss to us that would result from a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows 
this sensitivity analysis assumes an unfavorable fluctuation in both of the exchange rates affecting both of the foreign currencies in which the indebtedness and the financial instruments described above are denominated and does not take into account the offsetting effect of such a change on our foreign currency denominated revenues 
interest rate risk we manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt in our debt portfolio 
to manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate changes  we have in the past entered into interest rate swap agreements 
in october  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million that matured in october if  at any time  the swap was determined to be ineffective  in whole or in part  due to changes in the interest rate swap agreement  the fair value of the portion of the interest rate swap determined to be ineffective would have been recognized as gain or loss in the statement of operations for the applicable period 
the hedge was effective throughout the time of the swap 
at december   we had approximately million in loans and financing outstanding  of which approximately million bear interest at fixed interest rates and approximately million bear interest at variable rates of interest 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments 
our percentage of variable rate debt to total debt was and at december  and  respectively 
depending upon the level of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our excess cash  the effect of a hypothetical  instantaneous and unfavorable change of basis points in the interest rate may have approximately million negative impact on our earnings or cash flows
