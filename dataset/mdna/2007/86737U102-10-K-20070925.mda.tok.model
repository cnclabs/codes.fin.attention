corporate business strategy since  our business strategy has focused on the acquisition and operation of community hospitals in the united states 
on february   sunlink purchased five community hospitals  leasehold rights for a sixth existing hospital and the related businesses of all six hospitals for approximately  in october  we acquired two additional hospitals through our acquisition of healthmont  inc in june  we sold our mountainside medical center  a bed hospital located in jasper  ga for approximately  through our subsidiaries  we currently operate a total of seven community hospitals in four states 
currently six of the hospitals are owned and one is leased 
our primary operational strategy is to improve the profitability of our hospitals by reducing out migration of patients  recruiting physicians  expanding services and implementing and maintaining effective cost controls 
our efforts are focused on internal growth 
however  we actively seek to supplement internal growth through acquisitions 
our acquisition strategy is to selectively acquire community hospitals with net revenues of approximately  or more which are the sole or primary hospital in market areas with a population of greater than  or a principal healthcare provider with substantial market share in communities with a population of  to  we believe all of our seven existing hospitals meet at least one of these two market area criteria 
the company considers recent prices paid by others for certain hospital acquisitions to be higher than we would seek to pay but believes there may be opportunities for acquisitions of hospitals in the future due to  among other things  negative trends in certain government reimbursement programs and other factors 
from time to time we may consider hospitals for disposition if we determine their operating results or potential growth no longer meet our strategic objectives 
sunlink announced in december that its board of directors had retained a financial advisor for the purpose of evaluating the company s strategic alternatives  which alternatives could include a sale of the company or a merger  acquisition or other transactions 
in december  sunlink announced that its board of directors had determined to focus the company s strategic efforts on continued improvement in its existing hospital portfolio and pursuing additional hospital acquisitions 
sunlink also announced that discussions with a company about a potential acquisition of sunlink had been terminated 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been made could have a material impact on our consolidated statement of earnings or financial condition 
the table of critical accounting estimates that follows is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies that require estimates 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  as discussed in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june   the estimates discussed below involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the table that follows presents information about our critical accounting estimates  as well as the effects of hypothetical changes in the material assumptions used to develop each estimate balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item dollar amounts in thousands  except per share assumption approach used dollar amounts in thousands  except per share sensitivity analysis dollar amounts in thousands  except per share receivables net and provision for bad debts receivables net primarily consists of amounts due from third party payors and patients from providing healthcare services to hospital facility patients 
our ability to collect outstanding receivables is critical to our results of operations and cash flows 
to provide for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
the primary uncertainty lies with accounts for which patients are responsible  which we refer to as patient responsibility accounts 
these accounts include both amounts payable by uninsured patients and co payments and deductibles payable by insured patients 
our allowance for doubtful accounts  included in our balance sheets as of june was as follows  and our provision for bad debts  included in our results of operations  was as follows  and the largest component of bad debts in our patient accounts receivable relates to accounts for which patients are responsible  which we refer to as patient responsibility accounts 
these accounts include both amounts payable by uninsured patients and co payments and deductibles payable by insured patients 
in general  we attempt to collect deductibles  co payments and self pay accounts prior to the time of service for non emergency care 
if we do not collect these patient responsibility accounts prior to the delivery of care  the accounts are handled through our billing and collections processes 
we attempt to verify each patient s insurance coverage as early as possible before a scheduled non emergency admission or procedure  including with respect to eligibility  benefits and authorization pre certification requirements  in order to notify patients of the estimated amounts for which they will be responsible 
we attempt to verify insurance coverage within a reasonable amount of time for all emergency room visits and non emergency urgent admissions in compliance with the emergency medical treatment and active labor act 
in general  we utilize the following steps in collecting accounts receivable if possible  cash collection of all or a portion of deductibles  co payments and self pay accounts prior to or at the time a significant increase in our provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenues would lower our earnings 
this would adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and potentially our future access to capital 
if net revenues during fiscal were changed by  our after tax income from continuing operations would change by approximately or diluted earnings per share of 
this is only one example of reasonably possible sensitivity scenarios 
the process of determining the allowance requires us to estimate uncollectible patient accounts that are highly uncertain and requires a high degree of judgment 
it is impacted by  among other things  changes in regional economic conditions  business office operations  payor mix and trends in private and federal or state governmental healthcare coverage 
balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item dollar amounts in thousands  except per share assumption approach used dollar amounts in thousands  except per share sensitivity analysis dollar amounts in thousands  except per share receivables net and provisions for bad debts continued service is provided  billing and follow up with third party payors  collection calls  utilization of collection agencies  sue to collect if the patient has the means to pay and chooses not to pay  and if collection efforts are unsuccessful  write off the accounts 
our policy is to write off accounts after all collection efforts have failed  which is typically no longer than days after the date of discharge of the patient 
patient responsibility accounts represent the majority of our write offs 
all of our hospitals retain third party collection agencies for billing and collection of delinquent accounts 
at most of our hospitals  more than one collection agency is used to promote competition and improved performance 
the selection of collection agencies and the timing of referral of an account to a collection agency vary among hospitals 
generally  we do not write off accounts prior to utilizing the services of a collection agency 
once collection efforts have proven unsuccessful  an account is written off from our patient accounting system against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we determine the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts utilizing a number of analytical tools and benchmarks 
no single statistic or measurement alone determines the adequacy of the allowance 
we monitor the revenue trends by payor classification on a quarter by quarter basis along with the composition of our accounts receivable agings 
this review is balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item dollar amounts in thousands  except per share assumption approach used dollar amounts in thousands  except per share sensitivity analysis dollar amounts in thousands  except per share focused primarily on trends in self pay revenues  accounts receivable  co payment receivables and historic payment patterns 
in addition  we analyze other factors such assays revenue in accounts receivable and we review admissions and charges by physicians  primarily focusing on recently recruited physicians 
days outstanding payor class total medicare commercial medicaid self pay total the above table shows net patient accounts receivable aged from patient billing date and are grouped by classification of verified insurance coverage 
the receivables are net of contractual allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts 
contractual allowances and the allowance for doubtful accounts are calculated by payor class and are not calculated by the aging from the patient billing date  therefore  these allowances have been allocated within the aging of the various payor classes based upon gross patient receivable amounts 
revenue recognition net patient service revenues we recognize revenues in the period in which services are provided 
patient receivables primarily consist of amounts due from third party payors and patients 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by governmental programs  such as medicare and medicaid  and other third party payors  such as hmos  ppos and other private insurers  are determined pursuant to contracts or established government rates and are generally less than our established billing rates 
accordingly  our gross revenues and patient receivables are reduced to net amounts receivable pursuant to such contracts or government payment revenues are recorded at estimated amounts due from patients  third party payors and others for healthcare services provided net of contractual discounts pursuant to contract or government payment rates 
estimates for contractual allowances are calculated using computerized and manual processes depending on the type of payor involved 
in certain hospitals  the contractual allowances are calculated by a computerized system based on payment terms for each payor 
in other hospitals  the contractual allowances are estimated manually using historical collections for balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item dollar amounts in thousands  except per share assumption approach used dollar amounts in thousands  except per share sensitivity analysis dollar amounts in thousands  except per share revenue recognition net patient service revenues continued rates through an allowance for contractual discounts 
approximately of our revenues during relate to discounted charges 
the sources of these revenues were as follows as a percentage of total revenues medicare  medicaid  and commercial insurance each type of payor 
for all hospitals  certain manual estimates are used in calculating contractual allowances based on historical collections from payors that are not significant or have not entered into a contract with us 
all contractual adjustments regardless of type of payor or method of calculation are reviewed and compared to actual experience on a periodic basis 
accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from third party payors and patients 
amounts we receive for the treatment of patients covered by hmos  ppos and other private insurers are generally less than our established billing rates 
we include contractual allowances as a reduction to revenues in our financial statements based on payor specific identification and payor specific factors for rate increases and denials 
governmental payors governmental payors the majority of services performed on medicare and medicaid patients are reimbursed at predetermined reimbursement rates 
the differences between the established billing rates ie  gross charges and the predetermined reimbursement rates are recorded as contractual discounts and deducted from gross charges 
under this prospective reimbursement system  there is no adjustment or settlement of the difference between the actual cost to provide the service and the predetermined reimbursement rates 
because the laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to change  the estimates of contractual discounts we record could change by material amounts 
adjustments related to final settlements for revenues retrospectively increased our revenues by the following amounts  and balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item dollar amounts in thousands  except per share assumption approach used dollar amounts in thousands  except per share sensitivity analysis dollar amounts in thousands  except per share revenue recognition net patient service revenues continued discounts for retrospectively cost based revenues  which were more prevalent in periods before  are estimated based on historical and current factors and are adjusted in future periods when settlements of filed cost reports are received 
final settlements under these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third party intermediaries  which can take several years to resolve completely 
commercial insurance commercial insurance for most managed care plans  contractual allowances estimated at the time of service are adjusted to actual contractual allowances as cash is received and claims are reconciled 
we evaluate the following criteria in developing the estimated contractual allowance percentages historical contractual allowance trends based on actual claims paid by managed care payors  review of contractual allowance information reflecting current contract terms  consideration and analysis of changes in payor mix reimbursement levels  and other issues that may impact contractual allowances 
if our overall estimated contractual discount percentage on all of our commercial revenues during were changed by  our after tax income from continuing operations would change by approximately this is only one example of reasonably possible sensitivity scenarios 
the process of determining the allowance requires us to estimate the amount expected to be received and requires a high degree of judgment 
it is impacted by changes in managed care contracts and other related factors 
a significant increase in our estimate of contractual discounts would lower our earnings 
this would adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and future access to capital 
balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item dollar amounts in thousands  except per share assumption approach used dollar amounts in thousands  except per share sensitivity analysis dollar amounts in thousands  except per share goodwill and accounting for business combinations goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets including separately identified intangible assets of acquired companies 
our goodwill included in our consolidated balance sheets as of june  for the following years was as follows  and the goodwill resulted from the acquisition of healthmont  inc we follow the guidance in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and test goodwill for impairment using a fair value approach 
we are required to test for impairment at least annually  absent some triggering event that would accelerate an impairment assessment 
on an ongoing basis  absent any impairment indicators  we perform our goodwill impairment testing as of june of each year 
we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses 
these types of analyses require us to make assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows  industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
we performed our annual testing for goodwill impairment as of june  and using the methodology described here  and determined that no goodwill impairment existed 
if actual future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in the future 
the purchase price of acquisitions is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values and is subject to change during the twelve month period subsequent to the acquisition date 
we engage independent third party valuation firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the time of acquisition 
such valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including projections of future events and operating performance 
balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item dollar amounts in thousands  except per share assumption approach used dollar amounts in thousands  except per share sensitivity analysis dollar amounts in thousands  except per share fair value estimates are derived from independent appraisals  established market values of comparable assets  or internal calculations of estimated future net cash flows 
our estimate of future cash flows is based on assumptions and projections we believe to be currently reasonable and supportable 
our assumptions take into account revenue and expense growth rates  patient volumes  changes in payor mix  and changes in legislation and other payor payment patterns 
professional and general liability claims we are subject to potential medical malpractice lawsuits and other claims as part of providing healthcare services 
to mitigate a portion of this risk  we have maintained insurance for individual malpractice claims exceeding a self insured retention amount 
for the period february  to february   the self insured retention amount was per individual claim 
for the period february  to february   our self insured retention level was  on individual malpractice claims 
for the period march  to february   our self insured retention level was on individual malpractice claims 
for the period march  to february  and march  to february   our self insured retention level was or will be on individual malpractice claims 
each year  we obtain quotes from various malpractice insurers with respect to the cost of obtaining medical malpractice insurance coverage 
we compare these quotes to our most recent actuarially the reserve for professional and general liability claims is based upon independent actuarial calculations  which consider historical claims data  demographic considerations  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions in the determination of reserve estimates 
the reserve for professional and general liability claims reflects the current estimate of all outstanding losses  including incurred but not reported losses  based upon actuarial calculations as of the balance sheet date 
the loss estimates included in the actuarial calculations may change in the future based upon updated facts and circumstances 
we revise our reserve estimation process by obtaining independent actuarial calculations quarterly 
our estimated reserve for professional and general liability claims will be significantly affected if current and future claims differ from historical trends 
while we monitor reported actuarial calculations include a large number of variables that may significantly impact the estimate of ultimate losses recorded during a reporting period 
in determining loss estimates  professional judgment is used by each actuary by selecting factors that are considered appropriate by the actuary for our specific circumstances 
changes in assumptions used by our independent actuary with respect to demographics and geography  industry trends  development patterns and judgmental selection of other factors may impact our recorded reserve levels and our results of operations 
balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item dollar amounts in thousands  except per share assumption approach used dollar amounts in thousands  except per share sensitivity analysis dollar amounts in thousands  except per share professional and general liability claims continued determined estimates of losses at various self insured retention levels 
accordingly  changes in insurance costs affect the self insurance retention level we choose each year 
as insurance costs have increased in recent years  we have accepted a higher level of risk in self insured retention levels 
the reserve for professional and general liability claims included in our consolidated balance sheets as of june was as follows  and the total expense for professional and general liability coverage  included in our consolidated results of operations  was as follows  and claims closely and consider potential outcomes as estimated by our independent actuaries when determining our professional and general liability reserves  the complexity of the claims  the extended period of time to settle the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes complicates the estimation process 
in addition  certain states  including georgia  have passed varying forms of tort reform which may attempt to limit the number and types of claims and the amount of some medical malpractice awards 
if enacted limitations remain in place or if similar laws are passed in the states where our hospitals are located  our loss estimates could decrease 
conversely  liberalization of the number and type of claims and damage awards permitted under any such law applicable to our operations could cause our loss estimates to increase 
changes in our initial estimates of professional and general liability claims are non cash charges and accordingly  there would be no material impact currently on our liquidity or capital resources 
balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item dollar amounts in thousands  except per share assumption approach used dollar amounts in thousands  except per share sensitivity analysis dollar amounts in thousands  except per share accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets generally represent items that will result in a tax deduction in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not probable  a valuation allowance is established 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance  we must include an expense as part of the income tax provision in our results of operations 
our net deferred tax asset balance net of valuation allowance in our consolidated balance sheets as of june for the following years was as follows  and our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of june for the following years were as follows  and in addition  significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of certain tax related contingencies 
we establish accruals when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  it is probable that we have incurred a loss related to tax contingencies and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we adjust the accruals related to tax contingencies as part of our provision for income taxes in our results of operations based upon changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit  development of the first step in determining the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is identifying reporting jurisdictions where we have a history of tax and operating losses or are projected to have losses in future periods as a result of changes in operational performance 
we then determine if a valuation allowance should be established against the deferred tax assets for that reporting jurisdiction 
the second step is to determine the amount of the valuation allowance 
we will generally establish a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset deferred tax assets less deferred tax liabilities related to the jurisdiction identified in the first step of the analysis 
in certain cases  we may not reduce the valuation allowance by the amount of the deferred tax liabilities depending on the nature and timing of future taxable income attributable to deferred tax liabilities 
in assessing tax contingencies  we identify tax issues that we believe may be challenged upon examination by the taxing authorities 
we also assess the likelihood of sustaining tax benefits associated with tax planning strategies and reduce tax benefits based on management s judgment regarding such likelihood 
we compute the tax on each contingency 
we then determine the amount of loss  or reduction in tax benefits based upon the foregoing and reflect such amount as a component of the provision for income taxes in the reporting period 
our deferred tax assets exceeded our deferred tax liabilities by  as of june   excluding the impact of valuation allowances 
we generated federal taxable income in fiscal years  and therefore  we believe that the likelihood of our not realizing the federal tax benefit of our net deferred tax assets is remote 
the irs may propose adjustments for items we have failed to identify as tax contingencies 
if the irs were to propose and sustain assessments equal to of our taxable income for  we would incur approximately of additional tax payments for plus applicable penalties and interest

a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established an accrual  is audited and resolved 
during each reporting period  we assess the facts and circumstances related to recorded tax contingencies 
if tax contingencies are no longer deemed probable based upon new facts and circumstances  the contingency is reflected as a reduction of the provision for income taxes in the current period 
financial summary the results of continuing operations shown in the historical summary below are for our us community hospital operations  which is composed of five facilities acquired february  shl facilities and two healthmont facilities acquired october  healthmont facilities 
years ended june  net revenues cost of patient service revenues operating profit interest expense interest income loss on early repayment of debt earnings from continuing operations before income taxes admissions equivalent admissions surgeries revenue per equivalent admission equivalent admissions equivalent admissions is used by management and certain investors as a general approximation of combined inpatient and outpatient volume 
equivalent admissions are computed by multiplying admissions inpatient volume by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and gross outpatient revenues and dividing the result by gross inpatient revenues 
the equivalent admissions computation is intended to relate outpatient revenues to the volume measure admissions used to measure inpatient volume to result in a general approximation of combined inpatient and outpatient volume equivalent admissions 
results of operations all of our net revenues are from our us community hospital segment 
the operations of sunlink s former mountainside medical center which was operated during these periods is reported in discontinued operations for all periods discussed 
net revenue for the year ended june  were  with a total of  equivalent admissions and revenues per equivalent admission of  compared to net revenues of  a total of  equivalent admissions and revenues per equivalent admission of  for the year ended june  the increase in net revenues for the year ended june  was primarily from a increase in equivalent admissions and a increase in self pay net revenues 
net outpatient service revenues increased  a increase from last year to  and increased to of net revenues from last year

net revenues for the year ended june  were  with a total of  equivalent admissions and revenues per equivalent admission of  compared to net revenues of  a total of  equivalent admissions and revenues per equivalent admission of  for the year ended june  the increase in net revenues for the year ended june  was due to an increase in commercial insurance net revenues which increased in the year ended june  and an increase in revenue per equivalent admission resulting from price increases for most services at our hospitals 
net outpatient service revenues increased  a increase from the year ended june  to  and increased to of net revenues from from the year ended june  net revenues for the years ended june  and included  and  respectively  from state indigent care programs 
recruitment of new doctors and spending for capital improvements have contributed greatly to the increase in net revenues in the years ended june   and  respectively 
we added seven net new doctors during the year ended june   net new doctors during the year ended june   and six net new doctors during the year ended june  during the year ended june   sunlink expensed  on physician guarantees and recruiting expenses compared to  last year 
we also have expended approximately  for capital expenditures to upgrade services and facilities since july  we believe the upgraded services and facilities and the new doctors contributed to the increase in net revenues for the years ended june  and  respectively  compared to the prior years 
we continue to seek increased patient volume by attracting additional physicians to our hospitals  further upgrading the services offered by the hospitals and improving the hospitals physical facilities 
the following table sets forth the percentage of net patient revenues from various payors in the company s hospitals for the periods indicated years ended june  source medicare medicaid self pay commercial insurance other during the fiscal year ended june   we experienced a decrease in medicaid and commercial insurance and other as a percentage of net revenues and an increase in self pay revenues 
the changes were due primarily to increased patients without medical insurance  fewer patients qualifying for medicaid and increasing deductibles and co insurance required for insured patients 
medicare net revenues increased in the fiscal year ended june  but were unchanged as a percentage of total net revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year during the fiscal year ended june   we experienced a decrease in medicare as a percentage of net revenues and an increase in self pay and commercial insurance and other revenues 
in each case  the changes were due primarily to increased managed care patients and increased out patient revenues

other operating expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenues in the year ended june  compared to the prior year due to decreased insurance and physician recruiting expense 
the decrease in insurance expense resulted from lower insurance costs and lower actuarially determined liability for professional risks 
purchased services increased as a percentage of net revenues in the year ended june  compared to the prior year due to increased usage of outside services such as radiology  nuclear medicine and mri 
depreciation and amortization expense was   and  for the years ended june    and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal years and depreciation and amortization expense resulted from the  spent for new equipment for all hospitals and the renovation of one facility over the past two fiscal years 
interest expense was   and  for the years ended june   and   respectively 
the increase in fiscal years and interest expense resulted from higher outstanding debt amounts and interest rates on floating rate debt 
operating profit was   and  for the years ended june   and   respectively 
the decrease in operating profit in the year ended june  compared to the prior year was mainly due to significant increase in the bad debt provision and the increase in depreciation and amortization expense 
the increase in operating profit in the year ended june  compared to the prior year was mainly due to the increase in net revenues and lower professional liability risks 
in october  we repaid  from proceeds of a new  credit facility  mortgages totaling  due august  a term note with a principal amount of  due august and a revolving loan with  outstanding 
the early repayment resulted in a loss on early repayment of debt of this loss is composed of of unamortized prepaid debt costs related to the repaid debt instruments and a penalty related to the early repayment of the revolving loan

we had an estimated net operating loss carry forward for federal income tax purposes of approximately  at june  use of this net operating loss carry forward is subject to the limitations of the provisions of internal revenue code section as a result  not all of the net operating loss carry forward is available to offset federal taxable income in the current year 
we have provided a valuation allowance for  of our  gross deferred tax asset the majority of which is the net operating loss carry forward for federal income tax purposes as it is our assessment based upon the criteria identified in sfas no 
that it is currently more likely than not that only  of the gross deferred tax asset will be realized through future taxable earnings or implementation of tax planning strategies 
earnings from continuing operations were  per fully diluted share for the year ended june  compared to earnings from continuing operations of  per fully diluted share for the year ended june  and  per fully diluted share for the year ended june  earnings from continuing operations in fiscal decreased from fiscal due to decreased operating profit which resulted from higher provision for bad debts and depreciation and amortization expense and a higher effective income tax rate in fiscal earnings from continuing operations in fiscal decreased from fiscal due to a higher effective income tax rate in fiscal due to lower net operating tax loss carry forwards available in fiscal earnings from continuing operations in fiscal decreased from fiscal due to a higher effective income tax rate in fiscal due to lower net operating tax loss carry forwards available in fiscal loss from discontinued operations of for the year ended june  resulted from of losses after tax benefit from mountainside  primarily due to legal expenses and of after tax benefit losses resulting from domestic pension items

we understand that certain industry analysts and investors generally consider ebitda to be one measure of the liquidity of a company  and it is presented to assist analysts and investors in analyzing the ability of a company to generate cash  service debt and meet capital requirements 
we believe increased ebitda is an indicator of improved ability to service existing debt and to satisfy capital requirements 
ebitda  however  is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash liquidity 
because ebitda is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other corporations

sunlink expended   and  for capital expenditures at our hospitals included in continuing operations during the years ended june   and  respectively 
these capital expenditures were primarily for new and replacement equipment and the dahlonega projects 
we believe an attractive  up to date physical facility assists in recruiting quality staff and physicians  as well as attracting patients 
as of june   sunlink had approximately  in accounts payable for capital expenditures accepted prior to the quarter end 
the company has also begun a major renovation project at our dahlonega  georgia  facility which has an estimated cost of approximately  of which approximately  of cost has been paid or accrued to date and of which approximately  additional costs will be paid or accrued by the end of the current fiscal year 
except for the dahlonega  georgia major renovation  there are no other material future commitments for capital expenditures 
in august  the company received final approval of a certificate of need application with the state of georgia to build a replacement hospital in ellijay  georgia

the revolving line of credit and the sunlink term loan a were immediately available to the company as of october  the sunlink term loan b closed on november  the  sunlink term loan a and draws under the  sunlink term loan b are repayable based on a year amortization from the date of draw with final balloon payments due at the end of the five year maturity of the credit facility 
the total availability under all components of the credit facility is keyed to the level of sunlink s earnings  which would have provided for current total borrowing capacity at june  of approximately  debt outstanding under the facility as of the fiscal year end june  was the sunlink term loan a of  and  of the revolving line of credit 
sunlink may use the remaining funds from the initial draw and the funds available from the revolving line of credit for hospital capital projects and equipment purchases and for working capital needs 
the company began using the revolving line of credit during july borrowing under the  sunlink term loan b may be used  subject to satisfaction of certain covenants  to satisfy certain claims or obligations with respect to discontinued operations  to fund acquisitions or to reacquire the company s securities 
costs and fees related to execution of the credit facility were the credit facility is secured by a first priority security interest in all assets and properties  real and personal  of the company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries  including a pledge of all of the equity interests in such subsidiaries 
if sunlink or its applicable subsidiaries experience a material adverse change in their business  assets  financial condition  management or operations  or if the value of the collateral securing the sunlink credit facility decreases  we may be unable to draw on the credit facility 
we believe we have adequate financing and liquidity to support our current level of operations through the next twelve months 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from continuing operations and availability under the sunlink credit facility 
the total availability of credit under all components of the sunlink credit facility is keyed to the level of sunlink s earnings  which  based upon the company s estimates  would provide for current borrowing capacity of approximately  at june   of which  was outstanding under a term loan and  was outstanding on a revolver loan

discontinued operations krug international uk ltd 
krug uk  an inactive uk subsidiary of sunlink  entered into a guarantee the beldray lease guarantee at a time when it owned beldray limited  a uk manufacturing business 
the beldray lease guarantee covers beldray s obligations under a lease for a portion of beldray s manufacturing location 
in october  krug uk received correspondence from the landlord of such facility stating that the rent payment of  british pounds for the fourth quarter of had not been paid by beldray and requesting payment of such amount pursuant to the beldray lease guarantee 
in january  krug uk received further correspondence from the landlord demanding two quarterly rent payments totaling  british pounds under the beldray lease guarantee 
on january   the landlord filed a petition in the high court of justice chancery division to wind up krug uk under the provisions of the insolvency act of and krug uk was placed into involuntary liquidation by the high court in february after that date  the court appointed liquidator of krug uk made certain inquiries of sunlink regarding the activities of krug uk prior to the liquidation to which sunlink has responded 
on august   the liquidator of krug uk made an application in the birmingham county court in birmingham  england  in which the liquidator is seeking a declaration by the court that certain transactions in from krug uk to sunlink in connection with the purchase of certain preferred stock of another subsidiary of sunlink and the making of a loan to sunlink  and certain deductions to debt owed to sunlink by krug uk were improper because krug uk was then effectively insolvent and the approval of such transactions by the then directors of krug uk resulted in a breach of their fiduciary duties 
the liquidator seeks to have the court order the former directors or  in the alternative  the company  to account for  or reverse such transactions to the liquidator of krug uk 
a hearing on this application is set for october in connection with the allegations in the application of breach of fiduciary duty by the directors of krug uk in approving such transactions  sunlink has indemnification obligations to the former directors of krug uk 
sunlink denies any liability to krug uk other than to it in its status as a preferred stockholder and for the unpaid balance on the promissory note 
sunlink  through its united kingdom counsel  intends to vigorously defend against the liquidator s claims 
sunlink s non current liability reserves for discontinued operations at june   included a reserve for a portion of the beldray guarantee 
such reserve was based upon management s estimate  after consultation with its property consultants and legal counsel  of the cost to satisfy the beldray guarantee in light of krug uk s limited assets and before taking into account any other claims against krug uk 
the maximum potential obligation of krug uk for rent under the beldray guarantee is estimated to be approximately  as a result of this claim and the uk liquidation proceedings against krug uk  sunlink expects krug uk to be wound up in liquidation in the uk and has fully reserved for any assets of krug uk 
additional contingent obligations  other than with respect to our existing operations  include potential product liability claims for products manufactured and sold before the disposal of our discontinued industrial segment in fiscal and for guarantees of certain obligations of former subsidiaries 
we have provided an accrual at june  related to the beldray lease guarantee  as discussed above 
we are currently in the process of liquidating two dormant subsidiaries in germany and france 
based upon an evaluation of information currently available and consultation with legal counsel  management has not reserved any amounts for contingencies related to these liquidations 
sarbanes oxley section we incurred incremental costs related to compliance with sarbanes oxley during the years ended june  and we anticipate that these costs will increase and become significant in future periods

as a consequence  we anticipate incurring expenses in the range of in the fiscal year ending june   as well as diverting substantial time of the company s management and board of directors  to this task 
while we currently are planning for timely completion of such documentation  testing and evaluation  there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement the requirements of section of sarbanes oxley with adequate compliance by june  should we be unable to do so  we could be subjected to investigation by regulatory authorities  incur litigation costs and or suffer loss of our amex listing 
any such actions could adversely affect our financial results and or the market price of our common shares
