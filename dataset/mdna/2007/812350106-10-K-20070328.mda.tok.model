fiscal initiatives and accomplishments while holdings was formed as a direct result of the merger between kmart and sears  the company is an entirely new organization  with both a vision and mission that extend well beyond merely combining these two entities 
management of this new organization has developed vision and mission statements that describe the company holdings aspires to become

the company s mission is described by the following three simple  focused principles  against which every associate in the company is evaluated build customer relationships make more money improve every day in holdings senior management expended significant effort to disseminate holdings vision and mission throughout the organization in order to align all associates  from front line store managers and store associates serving customers directly to those associates supporting stores in corporate and administrative functions  on common goals and culture 
the company believes that the establishment of the proper culture  a culture where the vision and mission are shared across the entire organization  is a necessary first step for holdings to achieve prominence in the retail industry and become a great company 
the retail industry is highly competitive and as such holdings faces significant challenges to achieve prominence 
one significant challenge is the fact that the sales and profit productivity of many competitor stores exceeds that of holdings own stores 
therefore  the company believes the greatest near term value  and its greatest immediate challenge  comes from better utilizing holdings existing base of over  stores to deliver greater value to customers and ultimately holdings shareholders 
the company will strive to better leverage the significant scale it already has  as well as the company s brand strength and service offerings to improve holdings multi channel store  on line and catalog shopability and continue to give customers reasons to shop holdings more frequently 
while the company s mission principles build customer relationships  make more money and improve every day are simple in concept  they can be difficult to execute within the context of a highly competitive retail environment 
therefore  the company believes that it must improve its analytical capabilities and foster a discipline of continuous learning and fact based decision making in order to successfully execute these principles 
accordingly  in the company committed resources to improve the organization s overall analytical capabilities and implement a structured test  learn and deploy process to evaluate new initiatives 
the company believes that becoming a test and learn organization will allow it to better understand the needs of its existing and potential future customers and develop solutions to profitably meet those needs

with this nationwide rollout to kmart stores  the craftsman brand is now available at more than  locations in the united states and on sears 
com  enhanced product development and direct sourcing capabilities  accomplished through the major expansion of a manhattan based apparel design center  the purpose of which is to improve the quality  exclusivity and profitability of holdings apparel products 
this effort is part of a larger initiative at holdings to create a more vertical business model  in which holdings assumes a greater role in the development and design not merely the procurement of its apparel merchandise  improving the company s agility so that it can respond to and deliver merchandise that meets the needs of customers at a lower cost to the company 
holdings increased utilization of direct sourced merchandise from manufacturers has increased apparel gross margin rates  particularly at sears domestic  which had historically not utilized direct sourcing to the extent of its use at kmart  improved holdings on line capabilities and expertise by assembling management talent and building a team with relevant experience and knowledge to support the company s e commerce initiatives

based on positive customer response  the test program was expanded in fiscal  and currently approximately sears full line stores now feature the lands end store within a store concept 
at such locations  sears customers find increased square footage dedicated to lands end  including enhanced visual merchandising and an expanded product assortment for women  men  kids and home  all in one location 
additionally  the concept features a multi channel service area where customers can choose from the entire lands end assortment either online or by phone shopping for products that would otherwise not be available in the store  and remodeled approximately kmart stores to include sears brand products 
the company intends to continue its roll out of home appliances  including sears kenmore brand products  into both sears grand and kmart locations over the next several years as a means of expanding its points of distribution in response to competitor store growth

accordingly  to facilitate an understanding of the company s trends and on going performance  the company has presented pro forma results below for fiscal and fiscal in addition to the reported results for these years 
the pro forma results adjust the reported amounts for these two fiscal years to give effect to the merger as if it had occurred at the beginning of fiscal thus  the pro forma results include both kmart and sears results for the entire fiscal and fiscal periods 
a reconciliation of pro forma amounts to reported amounts has been included under the heading pro forma reconciliation

net income for fiscal  net income was billion compared with net income of million reported and million pro forma in fiscal net income for fiscal included an after tax charge of million reported and proforma for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting as described above 
the increase in net income for the year reflects increased operating income at both sears domestic and kmart  driven primarily by improved margin rate performance  most notably within apparel during the second half of fiscal  as well as improved expense management across all segments 
the favorable impact of these items more than offset the negative impact of sales declines in fiscal relative to pro forma sales levels for fiscal earnings per diluted share and significant items the table below sets forth earnings per share results for the company s most recent three fiscal years  reflected on both a reported and pro forma basis for fiscal and fiscal as explained above 
net income and earnings per diluted share results for all three fiscal years were impacted by certain significant items 
the magnitude of such items may vary significantly from period to period and  thereby  have a disproportionate effect on earnings for any given period  affecting the comparability of the company s financial performance 
accordingly  management considers the aggregate impact of these items  along with reported results  in reviewing and evaluating the company s financial performance 
the impact of these items on diluted earnings per share is shown in the following table reported pro forma earnings per diluted share less total return swap income income tax settlements visa mastercard settlement legal reserve aig annuity insurance co  et al 
v 
sears roebuck gain on sale of assets restructuring charges cumulative effect of change in accounting earnings per diluted share excluding the above items for fiscal  net income included the following significant items pre tax gains of million million after tax or per diluted share derived from the company s investment of a portion of its surplus cash see the interest and investment income section below for further details  a tax benefit of million per diluted share related to the resolution of certain income tax matters  a million pre tax gain million after tax or per diluted share recorded by the company for the aggregate amount received by holdings in june as part of the settlement of visa mastercard antitrust litigation  and  a pre tax charge of million million after tax or per diluted share related to an unfavorable verdict in connection with a pre merger legal matter concerning sears redemption of certain bonds in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this matter 
all three fiscal years were impacted by gains recorded on the sale of company assets 
these pre tax gains amounted to million million after tax or per diluted share in fiscal  million million after tax or per diluted share in fiscal  and million million after tax or per diluted share in fiscal the fiscal gain reflects kmart s completion of multiple sale and lease assignment transactions  including significant transactions with the home depot  inc home depot and sears 
the pro forma gain on sale of assets impact for fiscal  per diluted share as shown above  excludes the impact of gains recognized in fiscal for sales of properties to sears 
further details pertaining to these transactions are set forth in note of notes to consolidated financial statements

further details pertaining to these restructuring charges are set forth in note of notes to consolidated financial statements

further details pertaining to this cumulative effect charge are set forth in note of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 
total revenues and comparable store sales fiscal domestic comparable store sales were down in the aggregate  with sears domestic declining and kmart declining 
these declines are less than fiscal domestic comparable store sales declines of in the aggregate  and declines of and at sears domestic and kmart  respectively 
as was the case in fiscal  the current year declines primarily reflect the impact of increased competition and lower transaction volumes across most merchandise categories and formats 
in fiscal  notably larger declines within sears domestic s lawn and garden and home fashions businesses as further discussed below in the review of sears domestic s results  were partially offset by increased apparel and pharmacy sales at kmart  and increased women s apparel sales at sears domestic 
the fiscal sales increase within women s apparel at sears domestic was driven by stronger performance during the second half of the year  reflecting what the company believes are improved assortments in this category relative to last year 
in fiscal  sears domestic modified its apparel assortment to a more fashion forward offering  which was not successful and led to significant sales declines within sears domestic s apparel business during the second half of for the fourth quarter of fiscal  which includes the holiday selling season  domestic comparable store sales declined in the aggregate  with sears domestic and kmart recording comparable store sales declines of and  respectively 
fourth quarter comparable sales results largely reflect the same factors as noted above  however  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company experienced a sales decline in its home appliances business as a result of the slower us housing market and increased competition 
while the company believes that its efforts will make its products  brands and service offerings more responsive to the needs of customers and thereby improve the trend in domestic comparable store sales results during fiscal  the benefits derived from such efforts may be mitigated by the impact of continued market share pressure as competitors open additional locations and engage in heavy promotional activity 
the company expects these competitive trends to continue in the foreseeable future which may negatively affect both the company s sales performance and results of operations 
total revenues for fiscal were billion  as compared to revenues of billion reported and billion pro forma for fiscal the increase in fiscal revenues as compared to reported revenues in fiscal was primarily due to the inclusion of sears for the entire year in fiscal and  to a lesser degree  the inclusion of an additional week of sales in fiscal comprised of weeks as compared to fiscal comprised of weeks 
the company recorded a total of million in revenues during the rd week of fiscal fiscal revenues declined billion  or  to billion  as compared to fiscal pro forma revenues of billion 
the decline primarily reflects lower comparable store sales and the impact of kmart store closures  partially offset by the above noted additional week of sales recorded in the current year  and to a lesser degree  sales increases in sears domestic s home services business 
the company aims to pursue a course of disciplined revenue growth  whereby sales growth opportunities are analyzed to ensure that they provide sufficient possibility of improving the company s profitability and are consistent with the holdings mission of building long term customer relationships 
as noted above  in the near term  management believes the greatest overall benefit to holdings profitability will not come from increasing the company s store base  but rather primarily from better utilizing existing assets to deliver more value to customers 
gross margin rate gross margin as a percentage of merchandise sales and services revenue gross margin rate was in fiscal  as compared to reported and pro forma in fiscal the overall improvement in the company s gross margin rates during fiscal more than offset the unfavorable profit impact of the above noted revenue declines 
the company remained focused on the improvement of gross margins during fiscal  and gross margin rates improved across all business segments kmart  sears domestic and sears canada 
the overall improved gross margin rate primarily reflects improvements realized in the company s apparel businesses 
sears domestic was the largest contributor to the overall margin rate improvement  as gross margin rates at sears domestic improved across most full line store merchandise categories  with pronounced improvements in apparel 
kmart s margins improved  but to a lesser degree than at sears domestic 
the company believes the improved gross margin rate performance of its apparel business  and within women s apparel at sears domestic in particular  reflects the impact of having better product assortments in place relative to last year 
this improvement in assortments lowered apparel markdowns during the current year relative to prior year levels 
additional markdowns were taken in the latter half of to clear fashion apparel given poor customer response to sears domestic full line store apparel offerings last year 
additionally  apparel gross margins at both kmart and sears domestic benefited from fiscal efforts to procure products at a lower cost to the company including increased utilization of direct sourced merchandise  particularly at sears domestic  which had historically not utilized direct sourcing to the extent of its use at kmart 
also  sears domestic s home services and lands end businesses contributed to the overall improved gross margins for holdings during fiscal as was the case within other apparel businesses during fiscal  the improvement in lands end s gross margin reflects more extensive and effective use of direct sourced merchandise  as well as the favorable impact of pricing initiatives and stronger in season sales results 
selling and administrative expense rate selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues selling and administrative expense rate was in fiscal  as compared to reported and pro forma for fiscal the company remained focused on disciplined spending in fiscal  and the company s selling and administrative expense rate improved across all segments  with the most notable improvements made at sears canada 
the current year rate improvement primarily reflects improved expense management  particularly within payroll and benefits 
sears canada s improvement was due in part to the sale of sears canada s credit and financial products business in late fiscal  as well as improved expense management 
interest and investment income the company recorded interest and investment income of million in fiscal  as compared with million reported and million pro forma in fiscal the increased interest and investment income in fiscal was primarily due to total return swap income recognized in the current year 
during fiscal  the company entered into total return swaps and recognized million of investment income  consisting of realized gains of million and unrealized losses of million less million of interest cost 
these total return swaps are derivative contracts that synthetically replicate the economic return characteristics of one or more underlying marketable equity securities 
in exchange for receiving the return tied to the position underlying a total return swap  the company pays a floating rate of interest tied to libor on the notional amount of the contract 
changes in fair value of the total return swaps are recognized currently in earnings 
reduction in debt assumed as part of the merger debt levels were reduced by billion in fiscal this debt was primarily sears debt included in holdings consolidated balance sheet subsequent to the merger 
share repurchases the company repurchased approximately million of its common shares in fiscal at a total cost of approximately billion under the company s billion common share repurchase program described under the financing section below 
holdings consolidated results fiscal compared to fiscal as discussed above  the reported consolidated statement of income for fiscal includes sears results of operations only for the period subsequent to the merger  or from march  forward 
the company believes that presenting fiscal results on a pro forma basis  which includes sears results for the entire fiscal year  is important to an understanding and assessment of the company s results  trends and on going performance 
accordingly  the company has provided an analysis of operating results for fiscal as compared to fiscal results presented on both a reported and a pro forma basis 
fiscal revenues were billion as compared to billion reported and billion pro forma in fiscal as discussed above  the increase in fiscal revenues  as compared to reported revenues for fiscal  was primarily due to the inclusion of sears for the entire year in fiscal and  to a lesser degree  the inclusion of an additional week of sales in fiscal fiscal revenues declined billion  or  to billion  as compared to fiscal pro forma revenues of billion  as lower comparable store sales as discussed above and the impact of kmart store closures were partially offset by the above noted additional week of sales recorded in the current year  and to a lesser degree  sales increases in sears domestic s home services business 
the gross margin rate was in fiscal  as compared to reported and pro forma in fiscal gross margin rates improved across all business segments kmart  sears domestic and sears canada  with the increase primarily reflecting the above noted improvements being realized in the company s apparel businesses 
the selling and administrative expense rate was in fiscal  as compared to reported and pro forma for fiscal as noted above  the current year rate improvement primarily reflects improved expense management  with the most notable improvements made at sears canada due in part to the sale of sears canada s credit and financial products business in late fiscal  as well as improved expense management 
depreciation and amortization was billion for fiscal  as compared to billion reported and billion pro forma for fiscal the increased expense for fiscal  as compared to the reported expense for fiscal  was primarily attributable to the inclusion of sears for the entire year in fiscal gains on sales of assets were million in fiscal  as compared to million reported and million pro forma for fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to a million pre tax gain recognized in in connection with the sale of the company s former kmart headquarters in troy  michigan 
fiscal included a million gain on sale of business  which reflected a minority interest gain on the sale of sears canada s credit and financial services operations in november this gain had no impact on holdings net income as its entire impact was offset by increased minority interest expense 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail 
restructuring charges were million and million reported and proforma for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these charges included charges of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  for employee related termination costs associated with sears canada restructuring initiatives implemented during fiscal  including a workforce reduction of approximately  associates  as well as million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  at kmart for relocation assistance and employee termination related costs associated with holdings home office integration efforts 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail 
for fiscal  interest and investment income was million  as compared with million reported and million pro forma in fiscal as discussed above  the increased interest and investment income in fiscal was primarily due to total return swap income recognized in the current year 
other income is primarily comprised of bankruptcy related recoveries 
bankruptcy related recoveries decreased million in fiscal and represent amounts recovered from vendors who had received cash payment for pre petition obligations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail 
the impact of lower bankruptcy related recoveries in fiscal as compared with fiscal was partially offset by increased income recorded relative to foreign currency forward contracts for which hedge accounting was not applied 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
the effective tax rate increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  with the increase primarily attributable to the fact that the effective rate in fiscal benefited from the november sale of sears canada s credit and financial services business being taxed at a capital gains rate  lowering the effective tax rate for fiscal effective january   the company determined that it would be preferable to conform one of the accounting practices utilized by kmart to that of sears 
the company changed its method of accounting for certain indirect overhead costs from inventoriable costs to period expenses 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes  a change in accounting policy to conform the acquirer s policy to that of the acquired entity is treated as a change in accounting principle 
as a result of the accounting change  the company recorded a charge of million  net of taxes  in the first quarter of fiscal for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle 
the charge represents the amount of indirect costs reflected within inventory at the beginning of fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail 
fiscal compared to fiscal the consolidated statement of income for fiscal is not comparable to that for fiscal because fiscal does not include the results of sears 
additionally  holdings consolidated statement of income for fiscal is not representative of the company s on going operations as it only includes sears results of operations for the period subsequent to the merger  or from march  forward 
for these reasons  the company believes that an understanding of its reported results  trends and on going performance is not complete without presenting results on a pro forma basis 
accordingly  the company has provided an analysis of operating results for fiscal as compared to fiscal on both a reported and a pro forma basis 
total revenues were billion reported and billion pro forma for fiscal  as compared to total revenues of billion reported and billion pro forma for fiscal the increase in reported revenues was attributable to the addition of sears revenues of billion in fiscal  partially offset by a decline in kmart s revenues of billion  or  due to a reduction in the total number of kmart stores in operation and a comparable store sales decline of as discussed below 
the decline in pro forma revenues was primarily attributable to total revenue declines of and at sears domestic and kmart  respectively  partially offset by a revenue increase at sears canada  primarily due to the impact of favorable exchange rates 
total fiscal revenues also benefited from million of sales being recorded during the first quarter of fiscal as a result of three additional days being included in the fiscal period due to the company s change from a wednesday to a saturday month end 
domestic comparable store sales were down in the aggregate for fiscal  with sears domestic comparable store sales declining and kmart comparable store sales declining 
kmart s fiscal comparable store sales decline was primarily due to lower transaction volumes across most businesses 
apparel sales at kmart increased in fiscal on a comparable store basis  but this improvement was more than offset by sales declines in both home goods and the food and drug business 
the sharper decline in sears domestic s fiscal comparable store sales relative to kmart was due mainly to efforts initiated at sears in to improve gross margins by reducing reliance on certain promotional events 
disappointing performance within sears apparel business during was also a factor in the decline of sears comparable store sales during fiscal gross margin was reported and pro forma for fiscal  as compared to reported and pro forma for fiscal the increase in reported gross margin was primarily attributable to the addition of sears  which had a higher overall gross margin rate than kmart  in fiscal the increase in pro forma margin in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily attributable to improvement in sears domestic s gross margin rate  mainly as a result of improved inventory management and the utilization of more targeted clearance and promotional markdowns versus historical reliance on storewide events 
the selling and administrative expense rate was reported and pro forma for fiscal  as compared to reported and pro forma for fiscal the increase in the reported selling and administrative expense rate was primarily attributable to the addition of sears  which had a higher cost structure than kmart  in fiscal on a pro forma basis  selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained unchanged between fiscal and fiscal while selling and administrative expenses decreased by million in fiscal  primarily as a function of reduced payroll expenditures and cost saving initiatives  the selling and administrative expense rate was unchanged compared to fiscal  as the impact of these reductions was offset by lower expense leverage given lower overall sales  as well as increases at sears canada in both associate stock based compensation expense and marketing expense 
depreciation and amortization was million reported for fiscal  as compared to million reported for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the addition of sears  which accounted for million of the reported combined expense in fiscal the company realized gains on sales of assets of million reported and million pro forma for fiscal  as compared to million reported and million pro forma for fiscal during fiscal  the company entered into multiple agreements with home depot to sell four properties and assign leased properties for an aggregate purchase price of million  resulting in a total gain on sale of million 
also during fiscal  kmart sold four owned properties  assigned leased properties and leased one owned store to sears for a total purchase price of approximately million  resulting in a gain of million 
this gain on transactions with sears was excluded from the fiscal pro forma gain on sale of assets amount of million 
additionally  the company sold certain other real and personal property  resulting in net gains of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
included within the fiscal gains were million related to the sale of owned  or assignment of leased  properties  million related to the sale of the company s trinidad subsidiary and its associated property  million related to the sale of corporate airplanes and million from sales of other real and personal property 
restructuring charges were million reported and pro forma for fiscal as compared to million reported and million pro forma for fiscal the fiscal charges included a million charge for employee related termination costs associated with the above noted sears canada restructuring initiatives implemented during fiscal  as well as million at kmart for relocation assistance and employee termination related costs associated with holdings home office integration efforts 
the million charge recorded in fiscal reflected a charge recorded by sears in fiscal as part of a productivity initiative at that entity 
fiscal included a million gain on sale of business  which reflected a minority interest gain on the sale of sears canada s credit and financial services operations in november as discussed above 
interest and investment income was million reported and million pro forma in fiscal  as compared to million reported and million pro forma for fiscal the increase in reported interest and investment income was primarily attributable to the addition of sears  which accounted for million of the combined interest and investment income in fiscal interest expense was million reported and million pro forma in fiscal  as compared to million reported and million pro forma for fiscal the increase in reported interest expense was a result of the inclusion of sears debt in fiscal  which accounted for million of the combined interest expense in fiscal  as well as additional interest expense incurred upon the conversion of kmart s subordinated convertible notes  as further described in the uses and sources of liquidity section below 
the decline in pro forma interest expense was due primarily to lower average borrowings 
other income is primarily comprised of bankruptcy related recoveries 
bankruptcy related recoveries decreased million in fiscal and represented amounts recognized from vendors who had received cash payment for pre petition obligations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail 
the reported effective tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  with the decrease primarily attributable to the november sale of sears canada s credit and financial service business being taxed at a capital gains rate  lowering the effective tax rate for fiscal the pro forma effective tax rate increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  with the lower fiscal effective rate attributable to the inclusion of sears 
as noted above  effective january   the company changed its method of accounting for certain indirect overhead costs from inventoriable costs to period expenses and as a result recorded a charge of million  net of taxes  in the first quarter of fiscal for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail 
business segment results holdings has integrated many kmart and sears store support functions to more efficiently serve both formats  however  for purposes of reviewing operating performance and making asset allocation decisions  senior management has continued to utilize principally the reporting structures that existed independently for sears and kmart prior to the merger 
as a result  the following discussion of the company s business segments is organized into three segments kmart  sears domestic and sears canada 
kmart kmart results and key statistics were as follows millions  except for number of stores merchandise sales and services cost of sales  buying and occupancy gross margin dollars gross margin rate selling and administrative selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues depreciation and amortization gain on sales of assets restructuring charges total costs and expenses operating income number of stores comparable store sales and total sales decreased and  respectively  during fiscal the decline in kmart comparable store sales during fiscal compares to a decline in comparable store sales recorded for fiscal similar to the prior year  the current year decline in comparable store sales reflects the continued impact of increased competition and lower transaction volumes recorded across most businesses 
comparable store apparel sales increased for a second year during fiscal  but as was the case in fiscal  this improvement was more than offset by comparable store sales declines across most other kmart merchandise categories 
total sales in fiscal benefited from million in sales recorded during the rd week of the week fiscal year  partially offset by the fact that million of sales were recorded during the first quarter of fiscal as a result of three additional days being included in fiscal due to the company s change from a wednesday to a saturday month end last year 
however  the net favorable impact on fiscal sales derived from these items approximately was more than offset by the negative impact of a reduction in the total number of kmart stores in operation during fiscal  as compared to fiscal store closures and conversions accounted for an approximate decline in total kmart sales for fiscal  as fiscal total sales benefited from sales generated at stores subsequently closed in fiscal  as well as partial year sales recorded in stores closed during fiscal a net total of kmart stores were closed during fiscal  including kmart stores converted to a sears essentials grand format 
the remaining balance of the decline in total sales for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to the above noted decline in comparable store sales 
the decline in total sales for fiscal as compared with fiscal was due to the above noted fiscal decline in comparable store sales  as well as the impact of kmart store closures and conversions that occurred during a total of kmart stores were closed in fiscal  including kmart stores converted to a sears essentials grand format 
store closures and conversions accounted for a decline in total kmart sales for fiscal the gross margin rate was in fiscal  as compared to for fiscal this improvement reflects better margin management across a number of businesses  most notably within apparel  where an increased use of direct sourced merchandise obtained at a lower cost to the company  as well as enhanced profitability of promotional activity improved gross margin 
the gross margin rate was in fiscal  as compared to for fiscal  with the decline primarily attributable to lower expense leverage relative to buying and occupancy costs given lower sales levels in fiscal as compared to fiscal  as well as increased utilities and transportation expense stemming from higher energy price levels prevalent during fiscal the selling and administrative expense rate was for fiscal  as compared to for fiscal fiscal selling and administrative expenses included a million gain  representing kmart s portion of the settlement in the visa mastercard antitrust litigation 
this gain accounted for approximately basis points of the improvement in the selling and administrative expense rate 
the remaining basis point improvement reflects lower costs across a number of expense categories  most notably store payroll and benefit costs which were reduced in fiscal as a result of store payroll efficiency initiatives 
the selling and administrative expense rate was for fiscal  as compared to for fiscal  and improved primarily as a function of lower payroll and benefit costs due largely to reduced performance based incentive expense 
kmart recorded million and million in gains on sales of assets during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  with the increase for fiscal primarily attributable to a million pre tax gain recognized in fiscal in connection with the company s sale of kmart s former corporate headquarters in troy  michigan 
kmart recorded million in gains on sales of assets during fiscal attributable to gains on multiple agreements as discussed in the above review of consolidated results for fiscal kmart recorded restructuring charges of million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the charges were for relocation assistance and employee termination related costs incurred in connection with holdings home office integration efforts initiated in fiscal operating income for fiscal increased compared to fiscal  primarily as a function of improved expense management  as well as lower restructuring charges  as noted above 
the favorable impact on operating income derived from these factors  as well as the million gain recorded on the settlement of the visa mastercard antitrust litigation and the increased gains on assets sales  was partially offset by a decline in total gross margin dollars  as a result of lower overall sales levels  and  to a lesser degree  increased depreciation and amortization expense 
operating income for fiscal decreased compared to fiscal primarily due to million less in gains on the sale of assets realized in fiscal and  to a lesser degree  a decline in sales and gross margin dollars  and restructuring charges of million recorded in fiscal  offset by lower selling and administrative expense 
sears domestic as noted above  the consolidated statement of income for holdings includes sears domestic s results only for the period subsequent to march  for fiscal  and does not include sears domestic s results for fiscal the company believes that an understanding of its reported results and its ongoing financial performance is not complete without presenting sears domestic s results of operations on a pro forma basis for fiscal and fiscal accordingly  in addition to providing the reported results for fiscal and fiscal  the presentation below also provides the results of operations on a pro forma basis for both fiscal and fiscal sears domestic results and key statistics were as follows reported pro forma millions  except for number of stores merchandise sales and services cost of sales  buying and occupancy gross margin dollars gross margin rate selling and administrative selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues depreciation and amortization loss gain on sales of assets restructuring charges total costs and expenses operating income number of full line stores specialty stores total domestic sears stores fiscal includes full line store and sears essentials grand stores  fiscal includes full line store and sears essentials grand stores  fiscal includes full line stores and sears grand stores the discussion below pertains to pro forma information in the table above for purposes of reviewing results for fiscal and fiscal these pro forma results have been prepared assuming the merger occurred at the beginning of fiscal merchandise sales and services revenues declined billion  or  to billion for fiscal  as compared to total revenues of billion for fiscal the decline was due primarily to an aggregate decrease in comparable store sales  partially offset by an increase in the total number of full line stores in operation  as a number of kmart locations have been converted to the sears essentials grand format during the past months  increased sales within home services  and the fact that fiscal revenues benefited from million in sales recorded during the rd week of the week fiscal year 
the decline in comparable store sales during fiscal was recorded across most categories and formats  with more pronounced declines in both the lawn and garden and home fashions categories  partially offset by sales increases within women s apparel 
the sales increase in women s apparel reflects what the company believes are improved assortments in this business relative to last year  as noted in the above discussion of consolidated results 
sales within the lawn and garden category were weaker throughout fiscal  reflecting overall poor weather conditions prevalent during the majority of the summer selling season  the unfavorable impact of certain economic conditions  such as higher energy costs  on consumer demand for higher ticket discretionary purchases  and the absence of catastrophic weather events in the united states in the fall of  which drove sales of generators  chainsaws and other related power equipment during the fall of in regards to home fashions  the company believes sales declines in fiscal reflect the impact of a poorly executed launch of new product lines within this category during the second quarter of fiscal while  the negative trend in comparable store sales within home fashions decelerated somewhat during the fourth quarter  the company believes the poor launch continues to have a negative carryover impact on overall customer traffic within this category 
also of note  the rate of comparable store sales declines within home appliances at sears domestic accelerated somewhat during the fourth quarter of fiscal  reflecting what the company believes was the impact of both a slow housing market and increased competition 
the decline in sears domestic comparable store sales during fiscal compares to an decline in comparable store sales recorded for fiscal the decline in sears domestic comparable store sales during fiscal primarily reflected efforts initiated in fiscal to improve gross margin rates by reducing reliance on certain promotional events and  to a lesser extent  the above noted poor customer response to full line store fashion offerings 
gross margin rates improved for a second year at sears domestic  reaching for fiscal  as compared to and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the basis point improvement in gross margin rate realized during fiscal was due primarily to improved apparel margins as described above in the discussion of consolidated results 
also  the home services and lands end businesses contributed to the overall improved gross margins during fiscal as was the case within other apparel businesses during fiscal  the improvement in lands end s gross margin reflects more extensive and effective use of direct sourced merchandise  as well as the favorable impact of pricing initiatives and stronger in season sales results 
the basis point improvement in sears domestic s gross margin rate recorded during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily attributable to improved inventory management and the utilization of more targeted clearance and promotional markdowns versus historical reliance on storewide events 
the margin benefit derived in fiscal from better inventory management was partially offset by lower expense leverage relative to occupancy costs in that year due to lower sales levels and higher utilities and energy costs 
the selling and administrative expense rate was for fiscal  as compared to and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
as was the case in fiscal  the expense rate for fiscal was largely unchanged from prior year  as expense reductions across a number of categories were offset by lower expense leverage given lower sales levels 
the expense reduction in fiscal included  most notably  reductions in both marketing and payroll and benefits  which accounted for approximately basis points and basis points of improvement in the overall rate  respectively  however  the benefit derived from these and other reductions was offset by lower expense leverage 
sears domestic s selling and administrative expense for fiscal included the favorable impact of a million gain recorded in connection with settlement of visa mastercard antitrust litigation this year  and also benefited from the fact that fiscal expenses included million of merger related costs  however  the favorable impact derived from these items was more than offset by the recognition of a million accrual in the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with a pre merger legal matter concerning sears redemption of certain bonds in as discussed above 
depreciation and amortization expense was million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the higher level of depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal was due primarily to higher capital expenditure levels  as compared with fiscal and fiscal  and additional depreciation recognized during fiscal in connection with shortening the estimated remaining useful lives of certain information technology assets that were sold to an outside it service provider during that year 
operating income for fiscal increased compared to fiscal  primarily as a function of increased gross margin dollars  as well as lower selling and administrative costs 
operating income for fiscal increased compared to fiscal for the same reasons  as well as a result of lower depreciation and amortization expense  and due to the fact that fiscal was unfavorably impacted by a million charge recorded as part of a productivity initiative 
sears canada sears canada  a consolidated  owned subsidiary of sears  conducts retail and credit operations 
in november  sears canada completed the sale of its credit and financial services operations 
as noted above  the consolidated statement of income for holdings includes sears canada s results only for the period subsequent to the merger  or from march  through december  for fiscal  and does not include sears canada s results for fiscal the company believes that an understanding of its reported results and its ongoing financial performance is not complete without presenting sears canada s results on a pro forma basis for fiscal and fiscal accordingly  in addition to providing the reported results for fiscal and fiscal  the presentation below also provides the results of operations on a pro forma basis for both fiscal and fiscal in addition  as noted above  the results of operations for sears canada are reported to holdings on a one month lag 
sears canada results and key statistics were as follows reported pro forma millions  except for number of stores merchandise sales and services credit and financial products revenues total revenues cost of sales  buying and occupancy gross margin dollars gross margin rate selling and administrative selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues depreciation and amortization gain on sales of assets gain on sale of business restructuring charges total costs and expenses operating income number of full line stores specialty stores total sears canada stores the discussion below pertains to pro forma information in the table above  which compares sears canada s results for fiscal with sears canada s results for fiscal and fiscal these pro forma results have been prepared assuming the merger occurred at the beginning of fiscal total revenues increased to billion in fiscal  as compared to revenues of billion in fiscal the increase was due primarily to the impact of favorable exchange rates  as the canadian dollar strengthened during fiscal relative to fiscal excluding the impact of exchange rates  total revenues declined versus fiscal  primarily reflecting the impact of the sale of sears canada s credit and financial services operations in november the revenue stream from sears canada s credit and financial services operations was replaced in part by performance payments received pursuant to the strategic alliance with jpmorgan chase 
the performance payments are classified within merchandise sales and services and  along with the impact of favorable exchange rates  largely account for the increase in merchandise sales and services revenues as compared to fiscal sears canada comparable store sales declined during fiscal  as increased sales in major appliances and footwear were more than offset by declines across most other merchandise categories 
total fiscal revenues increased to billion  as compared to revenues of billion in fiscal  primarily as a result of favorable exchange rates 
excluding the impact of exchange rates  revenues in fiscal were flat versus fiscal the gross margin rate for fiscal as compared to fiscal increased primarily due to the combined effect of improved inventory management and less inventory shrinkage  as well as the favorable impact of a stronger canadian dollar on the cost of imported merchandise 
these same factors primarily account for the improved gross margin rate recorded in fiscal as compared to fiscal the selling and administrative expense rate declined for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the sale of sears canada s credit and financial services operations  the positive impact of productivity initiatives initiated at sears canada in late fiscal  and a reduction in marketing costs 
the selling and administrative expense rate for fiscal increased as compared to fiscal primarily due to increased associate stock based compensation and  to a lesser extent  increased marketing costs 
the stock based compensation increase accounted for approximately basis points of the total increase in the selling and administrative expense rate in fiscal and resulted mainly from an increase in sears canada s share price subsequent to its announcement of a definitive agreement to sell substantially all assets and liabilities of its credit and financial services operations  as well as changes in sears canada s associate stock plan to provide for early vesting of unvested options and allow associates to take cash payments in lieu of shares 
restructuring charges of million and million were recognized during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  in connection with the above noted productivity initiatives 
operating income was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal fiscal operating income included a gain on sale of business totaling million recorded to reflect the above noted minority interest gain on the sale of sears canada s credit and financial services business in november excluding this gain  operating income increased million in fiscal  as the impact of a decline in revenues resulting from the sale of sears canada s credit and financial services operations was more than offset by increased gross margin dollars and lower expenses  including million less in restructuring expenses 
operating income increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the above noted million gain on sale of business 
excluding this gain  operating income declined million in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to million in restructuring charges recorded in fiscal and higher selling and administrative expenses  partially offset by increased gross margin

lampert  subject to various limitations that have been or may be from time to time adopted by the board of directors and or finance committee of the board of directors 
the company  from time to time  invests its surplus cash in various securities and financial instruments  including total return swaps  which are derivative instruments that synthetically replicate the economic return characteristics of one or more underlying marketable equity securities 
in exchange for receiving the return tied to the position underlying a total return swap  the company pays a floating rate of interest tied to libor on the notional amount of the contract 
under the terms of the transactions with the respective counterparties  the company is required to post cash collateral of up to percent of the notional amount of the underlying total return swap position  plus the amount of any unrealized losses on the positions

the company bases its estimates on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  evaluation of trends and other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company continually evaluates the information used to make these estimates as its business and the economic environment change 
although the use of estimates is pervasive throughout the financial statements  the company considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or different estimates that could have been selected would have a material effect on the company s financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in the financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and the considerations used in estimating amounts  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of its board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to the selection of these estimates 
the following is a summary of the company s most critical estimates 
valuation of inventory the company s inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market determined primarily using the retail inventory method rim 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry 
to determine inventory cost under rim  inventory at its retail selling value is segregated into groupings of merchandise having similar characteristics  which are then converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors for each grouping of merchandise 
cost factors represent the average cost to retail ratio for each merchandise group based upon the fiscal year purchasing activity for each store location 
accordingly  a significant assumption under the retail method is that inventory in each group is similar in terms of its cost to retail relationship and has similar turnover rates 
management monitors the content of merchandise in these groupings to prevent distortions that would have a material effect on inventory valuation 
rim inherently requires management judgment and certain estimates that may significantly affect the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margin 
among others  two significant estimates used in inventory valuation are the level and timing of permanent markdowns clearance markdowns used to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory and shrinkage 
amounts are charged to cost of sales  buying and occupancy at the time the retail value of inventory is reduced through the use of permanent markdowns 
factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise  fashion trends and weather conditions 
in addition  inventory is also evaluated against corporate pre determined historical markdown cadences 
when a decision is made to permanently markdown merchandise  the resulting gross margin reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded 
the timing of the decision  particularly surrounding the balance sheet date  can have a significant effect on the results of operations 
shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the date of the last physical inventory to the end of the fiscal year 
physical inventories are taken at least annually for all stores on a staggered basis throughout the year and inventory records are adjusted accordingly 
the shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory  in combination with historical experience  is used as the standard for the shrinkage accrual following the physical inventory 
self insurance reserves the company uses a combination of third party insurance and or self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation  asbestos and environmental  automobile  warranty  product and general liability claims 
general liability costs relate primarily to litigation that arises from store operations 
self insurance reserves include actuarial estimates of both claims filed carried at their expected ultimate settlement value and claims incurred but not yet reported 
the company s estimated claim amounts are discounted using a rate with a duration that approximates the duration of the company s self insurance reserve portfolio 
the company s liability reflected on the consolidated balance sheets represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
in estimating this liability  the company utilizes loss development factors based on company specific data to project the future development of incurred losses 
loss estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims settlements and reported claims 
these projections are subject to a high degree of variability based upon future inflation rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
although the company does not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from its estimates  self insurance reserves could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from the historical trends and the actuarial assumptions 
defined benefit retirement plans the fundamental components of accounting for defined benefit retirement plans consist of the compensation cost of the benefits earned  the interest cost from deferring payment of those benefits into the future and the results of investing any assets set aside to fund the obligation 
such retirement benefits were earned by associates ratably over their service careers 
therefore  the amounts reported in the income statement for these retirement plans have historically followed the same pattern 
accordingly  changes in the obligations or the value of assets to fund them have been recognized systematically and gradually over the associate s estimated period of service 
the largest drivers of experience losses in recent years have been the discount rate used to determine the present value of the obligation and the actual return on pension assets 
the company recognizes the changes by amortizing experience gains losses in excess of the corridor into expense over the associate service period and by recognizing the difference between actual and expected asset returns over a five year period 
the sears domestic pension plans had no unrecognized experience gain or loss as of the date of the merger 
effective january   kmart s pension plans were frozen  and associates no longer earn additional benefits under the plans 
therefore  there are no assumptions related to future compensation costs relating to the kmart pension plans 
during the first quarter of  holdings announced that the sears domestic pension plan would be frozen effective january  accordingly  domestic associates have earned no additional benefits subsequent to december  benefits earned through december  will be paid out to eligible participants following retirement 
holdings actuarial valuations utilize key assumptions including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset investment returns  in determining these assumptions 
actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  changes in investment strategies and higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company recognized a reversal of approximately billion of its pre merger deferred income tax valuation allowance as a result of the merger and the combined tax attributes resulting from it 
sfas no 
requires that this reversal be included in the company s purchase accounting adjustments as a reduction to goodwill attributable to the merger 
given the company s current and forecasted levels of profitability  as well as its ability to realize the deferred tax assets through tax strategies if necessary  management believes that a significant portion of the deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized 
the remaining consolidated valuation allowance as of february  is million and relates to the uncertainty around the realization of certain state deferred tax assets all of which are attributable to sears 
the company will continue to assess the likelihood of realization of these state deferred tax assets and will reduce the valuation allowance on such assets in the future if it becomes more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be utilized 
the tax balances and income tax expense recognized by the company are based on management s interpretation of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions 
income tax expense also reflects the company s best estimates and assumptions regarding  among other things  the level of future taxable income  interpretation of the tax laws  and tax planning 
future changes in tax laws  changes in projected levels of taxable income  tax planning  and adoption and implementation of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin could affect the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company 
domestic and foreign tax authorities periodically audit the company s income tax returns 
these audits include questions regarding its tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating  the exposures associated with its various tax filing positions  the company records reserves for probable losses 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which the company has established a reserve  is audited and fully resolved 
management s estimates as of the date of the financial statements reflect its best judgment giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future  as additional facts become known or as circumstances change  or upon adoption of fin in the first quarter of fiscal new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified the consensus reached on emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
the eitf reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or a net basis is an accounting policy decision that requires disclosure 
eitf is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after december  the adoption of eitf will not have any effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company s revenues are reported net of sales taxes 
in july  the fasb issued fin this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording within the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in addition  fin provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest  penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure related to uncertain tax positions 
the provisions of fin are effective as of the beginning of the company s fiscal year 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of fin  during the first quarter of  on its financial statements and operating results 
the company currently estimates that the adoption of fin will not have any material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company s evaluation of the impact of fin is continuing  however  and is subject to revision when the company completes its analysis

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company faces market risk exposure in the form of interest rate risk  foreign currency risk and equity price risk 
these market risks arise from the company s derivative financial instruments and debt obligations 
interest rate risk the company manages interest rate risk through the use of fixed and variable rate funding and interest rate derivatives 
as of february   the company had interest rate derivatives with a notional amount of million  nominal fair value and a weighted average remaining life of years 
all debt securities and interest rate derivative instruments are considered non trading 
as of february   of the company s debt portfolio was variable rate 
based on the size of this variable rate debt portfolio at february   which totaled approximately million  an immediate basis point change in interest rates would have affected annual pretax funding costs by million 
these estimates do not take into account the effect on income resulting from invested cash or the returns on assets being funded 
these estimates also assume that the variable rate funding portfolio remains constant for an annual period and that the interest rate change occurs at the beginning of the period 
foreign currency risk as of february   the company had a series of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding  totaling million canadian notional value and with a weighted average remaining life of years  designed to hedge the company s net investment in sears canada against adverse changes in exchange rates 
the aggregate fair value of the forward contracts as of february  was million 
a hypothetical adverse movement in the level of the canadian exchange rate relative to the us dollar as of february   with all other variables held constant  would have resulted in a loss in the fair value of the company s foreign currency forward contracts of approximately million as of february  equity price risk the company  from time to time  invests its surplus cash in various securities and financial instruments  including total return swaps  which are derivative contracts that synthetically replicate the economic return characteristics of one or more underlying marketable equity securities 
in exchange for receiving the return tied to the position underlying a total return swap  the company pays a floating rate of interest tied to libor on the notional amount of the contract 
the fair value of a total return swap is based on the quoted market price of the underlying position and changes in fair value of the total return swaps are recognized currently in earnings 
during fiscal  the company entered into total return swaps and recognized million of investment income  consisting of realized gains of million and unrealized losses of million less million of interest cost 
as of february   the total return swaps had an aggregate notional amount of million and a fair value of million 
these investments are highly concentrated and involve substantial risks 
accordingly  the company s financial position and quarterly and annual results of operations may be positively or negatively materially affected based on the timing  magnitude and performance of these investments 
based on the aggregate notional amount of such total return swaps as of february   million  an immediate hypothetical increase or decrease of in the market value underlying the total return swaps outstanding would cause the company s pre tax earnings to increase or decrease concurrently by million 
these estimates assume that the total return swap portfolio remains constant 
counterparties the company actively manages the risk of nonpayment by its derivative counterparties by limiting its exposure to individual counterparties based on credit ratings  value at risk and maturities 
the counterparties to these instruments are major financial institutions with credit ratings of single a or better 
in certain cases  counterparty risk is also managed through the use of collateral in the form of cash or us government securities
