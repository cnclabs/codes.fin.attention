table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we are a leading provider of loyalty and marketing solutions derived from transaction rich data 
we partner with our clients to develop unique insight into consumer behavior 
we use that insight to create and manage customized solutions that we believe enhance consumer experiences and enable our clients to build stronger  mutually beneficial relationships with their customers 
we focus on facilitating and managing interactions between our clients and their customers 
we operate in three business segments marketing services  credit services and transaction services 
marketing services 
the marketing service segment generates revenue from our coalition loyalty program  the air miles reward program  and from our targeted marketing services programs run by epsilon 
in our air miles reward program  we primarily collect fees from our clients based on the number of air miles reward miles issued and in limited circumstances the number of air miles reward miles redeemed 
all of the fees collected for air miles reward miles issued are deferred and recognized over time 
air miles reward miles issued and air miles reward miles redeemed are the two primary drivers of revenue for this segment  and as a result they are both indicators of the success of the program 
these two drivers are also important in the revenue recognition process 
air miles reward miles issued the number of air miles reward miles issued depends upon the buying activity of the collectors at our participating sponsors 
the fees collected from sponsors for the issuance of air miles reward miles represents future revenue and earnings for us 
the revenue related to the service element of the air miles reward miles is initially deferred and amortized over the period of time beginning with the issuance of the air miles reward miles and ending upon their expected redemption which is the estimated life of an air miles reward mile  or months 
air miles reward miles redeemed a majority of the revenue we recognize in this segment is derived from the redemptions of air miles reward miles by collectors 
redemptions also show that collectors are attaining the rewards that are offered through our programs 
the revenue related to the redemption element is deferred until the collector redeems the air miles reward miles or over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile in the case of air miles reward miles that we estimate will go unused by the collector base or breakage 
we currently estimate breakage to be one third of air miles reward miles issued 
there have been no changes to management s estimate of the life of a mile or breakage in the periods presented 
our air miles reward program tends not to be significantly impacted by economic swings as the majority of the sponsors are in non discretionary categories such as grocery  petroleum and financial institutions 
additionally  we target the sponsors most loyal customers  who are unlikely to change their spending patterns 
we are impacted by changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar 
the canadian dollar appreciated in  which benefited our operating results by approximately million 
beginning in late  with the acquisition of epsilon  we began an expansion of our marketing services in the united states 
in  we continued our expansion of the services we provide with the acquisition of doubleclick email solutions  which strengthens our presence in email communication solutions 
additionally  with the recent acquisitions of icom and cpc  epsilon has also begun to expand its data product and services offerings 
epsilon generates revenue in a number of ways that range from transaction counts for interactive services to hourly rates for our strategic consulting services 
we believe that working with our client s customer data and strategy gives us an advantage through our opportunity to develop long term relationships with our clients 

table of contents credit services 
the credit services segment primarily generates revenue from securitization income  servicing fees from our securitization trusts  and merchant discount fees 
private label credit sales and average managed receivables are the two primary drivers of revenue for this segment 
private label credit sales this represents the dollar value of private label credit card sales that occur at our clients point of sale terminals or through catalogs or web sites 
generally  we are paid a percentage of these sales  referred to as merchant discount  from the retailers that utilize our private label credit card program 
private label credit sales typically lead to higher portfolio balances as cardholders finance their purchases through our credit card banks 
average managed receivables this represents the average balance of outstanding receivables from our cardholders 
customers are assessed a finance charge based on their outstanding balance at the end of a billing cycle 
there are many factors that drive the outstanding balances such as payment rates  charge offs  recoveries and delinquencies 
management actively monitors all of these factors 
generally we securitize our receivables  which results in a sale for accounting purposes and effectively removes them from our balance sheet to one of the securitization trusts 
credit services is affected by increased outsourcing in targeted industry verticals 
the growing trend of outsourcing of private label credit card programs leads to increased accounts and balances to finance 
we focus our sales efforts on prime borrowers and do not target sub prime borrowers 
additionally  economic trends can impact this segment 
interest expense is a significant component of operating costs for the securitized trusts 
over the last three years we have experienced a historically low interest rate environment 
we have refinanced our recent bond maturities with instruments that lock in our effective interest rate for up to five year terms and in some cases entered into declining interest rate swaps 
interest rates in were slightly higher than rates in during the fourth quarter of  congress enacted bankruptcy legislation with a two fold impact 
first  an acceleration of bankruptcies occurred in late as the result of cardholders filing for protection under the previous bankruptcy legislation  which was more lenient 
second  under the new legislation it is more difficult for cardholders filing bankruptcy to dispose of their obligations 
the enactment of the bankruptcy laws had a positive impact in to our net charge off rate  which was approximately for as compared to for for  we expect that the net charge off rate will stabilize to approximately  with costs of funds to remain consistent with transaction services 
the transaction services segment primarily generates revenue based on the number of statements generated  customer calls handled and transactions processed 
statements generated are the primary driver of revenue for this segment and represents the majority of revenue 
statements generated this represents the number of statements generated for our credit card and utility clients 
the number of statements generated in any given period is a fairly reliable indicator of the number of active account holders during that period 
in addition to receiving payment for each statement generated  we also are paid for other services such as remittance processing  customer care and various marketing services 
transaction services primarily is affected by industry trends similar to credit services 
companies are increasingly outsourcing their non core processes such as customer information systems  billing and customer care 
we are impacted by this trend with our clients in utility services and processing services

discussion of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies that are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our judgments and estimates in determination of our financial condition and operating results 
estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and  accordingly  actual results could differ from these estimates  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
securitization of credit card receivables 
we utilize a securitization program to finance substantially all of the credit card receivables that we underwrite 
we use our off balance sheet securitization program to lower our cost of funds and more efficiently use capital 
in a securitization transaction  we sell credit card receivables originated by our credit services segment to a trust and retain servicing rights to those receivables  an equity interest in the trust  and an interest in the receivables 
our securitization trusts allow us to sell credit card receivables to the trusts on a daily basis 
the securitization trusts are deemed to be qualifying special purpose entities under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  and are appropriately not included in our consolidated financial statements 
our interest in the trusts is represented on our consolidated balance sheets as seller s interest our interest in the receivables and due from securitizations our retained interests and credit enhancement components 
the trusts issue bonds in the capital markets and notes in private transactions 
the proceeds from the debt are used to fund the receivables  while cash collected from cardholders is used to finance new receivables and repay borrowings and related borrowing costs 
the excess spread is remitted to us as securitization income 
our retained interest  often referred to as an interest only strip  is recorded at fair value 
the fair value of our interest only strip represents the present value of the anticipated cash flows we will receive over the estimated life of the receivables  or months 
this anticipated excess cash flow consists of the excess of finance charges and past due fees net of the sum of the return paid to bond holders  estimated contractual servicing fees and credit losses 
because there is not a highly liquid market for these assets  we estimated the fair value of the interest only strip primarily based upon discount  payment and default rates  which is the method we assume that another market participant would use to purchase the interest only strip 
the fair value of the interest only strip  and the corresponding gain or loss  will be impacted by the estimated excess spread over the next two or three quarters 
the excess spread is impacted primarily by finance and late fees collected  net charge offs and interest rates 

table of contents changes in the fair value of the interest only strip are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as additional gains related to new receivables originated and securitized or other comprehensive income related to mark to market changes 
in recording and accounting for interest only strips  we make assumptions about rates of payments and defaults that we believe reasonably reflect economic and other relevant conditions that affect fair value 
due to subsequent changes in economic and other relevant conditions  the actual rates of principal payments and defaults generally differ from our initial estimates  and these differences could sometimes be material 
if actual payment and default rates are higher than previously assumed  the value of the interest only strip could be impaired and the decline in the fair value recorded in earnings 
further sensitivity information is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we recognize the implicit forward contract to sell new receivables during a revolving period at its fair value at the time of sale 
the implicit forward contract is entered into at the market rate and thus  its initial measure is zero at inception 
in addition  we do not mark the forward contract to fair value in accounting periods following the securitization as management has concluded that the fair value of the implicit forward contract in subsequent periods is not material 
air miles reward program 
because management has determined that the earnings process is not complete at the time an air miles reward mile is issued  the recognition of revenue on all fees received based on issuance is deferred 
we allocate the proceeds from issuances of air miles reward miles into two components based on the relative fair value of the related element redemption element 
the redemption element is the larger of the two components 
for this component  we recognize revenue at the time an air miles reward mile is redeemed  or  for those air miles reward miles that we estimate will go unredeemed by the collector base  known as breakage  over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
service element 
for this component  which consists of marketing and administrative services provided to sponsors  we recognize revenue pro rata over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
under certain of our contracts  a portion of the proceeds is paid to us at the issuance of air miles reward miles and a portion is paid at the time of redemption 
under such contracts the proceeds received at issuance are initially deferred as service revenue and the revenue and earnings are recognized pro rata over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
the amount of revenue recognized in a period is subject to the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
based on our historical analysis  we make a determination as to average life of an air miles reward mile 
the estimated life of an air miles reward mile of months and breakage of one third has remained constant for all periods presented 
breakage and the life of an air miles reward mile is based on management s estimate after viewing and analyzing various historical trends including vintage analysis  current run rates and other pertinent analysis 
during and  we engaged a nationally recognized accounting firm to perform an independent analysis of our breakage assumptions 
their conclusion supports management s breakage estimate of one third 
the estimated life of an air miles reward mile and breakage is actively monitored by management and subject to external influences that may cause actual performance to differ from estimates 
we believe that the issuance and redemption of air miles reward miles is influenced by the nature and volume of sponsors  the type of rewards offered  the overall health of the canadian economy  the nature and extent of air miles promotional activity in the marketplace and the extent of competing loyalty programs 
these influences will primarily affect the average life of an air miles reward mile 
we do not believe that the estimated life will vary significantly over time  consistent with historical trends 
the shortening of the life of an air miles reward mile would accelerate the recognition of revenue and may affect the breakage rate 
as of december   we had million in deferred revenue related to the air miles reward program that will be recognized in the future 
further information is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted the provisions of  and account for stock based compensation in accordance with  statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
we elected the modified prospective method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized ratably over the requisite service period 
we currently use a binomial lattice option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock by using an implied volatility 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on a forward curve of risk free interest rates based on constant maturity rates provided by the us treasury 
we have not paid and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all share based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense  the future periods may differ from what we have recorded in the current period and could affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the sfas no 
r disclosures 
inter segment sales our transaction services segment performs card processing and servicing activities for cardholder accounts generated by our credit services segment 
for this  our transaction services segment receives a fee equal to its direct costs before corporate overhead plus a margin 
the margin is based on current estimated market rates for similar services 
this fee represents an operating cost to the credit services segment and corresponding revenue for our transaction services segment 
inter segment sales are eliminated upon consolidation 
revenues earned by our transaction services segment from servicing our credit services segment  and consequently paid by our credit services segment to our transaction services segment  are set forth opposite other eliminations in the tables presented in the annual comparisons in our results of operations 

table of contents use of non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure equal to net income  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  plus stock compensation expense  provision for income taxes  interest expense  net  fair value loss on interest rate derivative  other expenses  depreciation and other amortization and amortization of purchased intangibles 
operating ebitda is a non gaap financial measure equal to adjusted ebitda plus the change in deferred revenue plus the change in redemption settlement assets 
we have presented operating ebitda because we use the financial measure to monitor compliance with financial covenants in our credit facilities and our senior note agreements 
for the year ended december   senior debt to operating ebitda was x compared to a maximum ratio of x permitted in our credit facilities and in our senior note agreements 
operating ebitda to interest expense was x compared to a minimum ratio of x permitted in our credit facility and x permitted in our senior note agreements 
as discussed in more detail in the liquidity section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  our credit facility and cash flows from operations are the two main sources of funding for our acquisition strategy and for our future working capital needs and capital expenditures 
as of december   we had borrowings of million outstanding under our credit facility  million of aggregate principal amount outstanding under our senior notes and had million in unused borrowing capacity 
we were in compliance with our covenants at december   and we expect to be in compliance with these covenants during the year ending december  we use adjusted ebitda as an integral part of our internal reporting to measure the performance of our reportable segments and to evaluate the performance of our senior management 
adjusted ebitda is considered an important indicator of the operational strength of our businesses 
adjusted ebitda eliminates the uneven effect across all business segments of considerable amounts of non cash depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of certain intangible assets that were recognized in business combinations 
a limitation of this measure  however  is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our businesses 
management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets  the impact of related impairments  as well as asset sales through other financial measures  such as capital expenditures  investment spending and return on capital 
adjusted ebitda also eliminates the non cash effect of stock compensation expense 
stock compensation expense is not included in the measurement of segment adjusted ebitda provided to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocations 
therefore  we believe that adjusted ebitda provides useful information to our investors regarding our performance and overall results of operations 
adjusted ebitda and operating ebitda are not intended to be performance measures that should be regarded as an alternative to  or more meaningful than  either operating income or net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  adjusted ebitda and operating ebitda are not intended to represent funds available for dividends  reinvestment or other discretionary uses  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap

changes in redemption settlement assets is also affected by the timing of receipts and transfers of cash

transaction services revenue increased million  or  primarily due to new customers in utility services such as cobb energy 
in addition  merchant services and private label had small increases in revenue 
the slight decrease in the number of statements generated is primarily attributable to one private label client that experienced a significant reduction in private label credit sales  which resulted in a corresponding reduction in statements generated for private label clients and the loss of a client that ceased operations in the fourth quarter of due to bankruptcy 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses  excluding depreciation  amortization and stock compensation expense increased million  or  to  million for from million for total adjusted ebitda margin increased to for from for the increase in adjusted ebitda margin is due to increases in marketing services and credit services margins  partially offset by a decrease in transaction services

the 
table of contents decrease in adjusted ebitda margin was primarily the result of higher expenses associated with corporate overhead  private label credit card clients and lower than expected volume growth 
stock compensation expense 
stock compensation expense decreased million  or  to million for from million for the decrease is primarily related to a decline in the fair value of the restricted stock awards issued in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase is primarily due to an increase of million in amortization of purchased intangibles related to recent acquisitions and new depreciation on capital expenditures  offset by a decrease of million as a result of certain assets completing their depreciable lives in late and early operating income 
operating income increased million  or  to million for from million for operating income increased primarily from revenue gains and an increase in adjusted ebitda margins partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense

interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for from million for due to higher average balances under our credit facilities and certificates of deposit 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased million to million in from million in primarily due to an increase in taxable income 
the effective rate remained relatively flat  decreasing to in from in asset quality our delinquency and net charge off rates reflect  among other factors  the credit risk of our private label credit card receivables  the average age of our various private label credit card account portfolios  the success of our collection and recovery efforts  and general economic conditions 
the average age of our private label credit card portfolio affects the stability of delinquency and loss rates of the portfolio 
we continue to focus resources on refining our credit underwriting standards for new accounts and on collections and post charge off recovery efforts to minimize net losses 
an older private label credit card portfolio generally drives a more stable performance in the portfolio 
at december   of securitized accounts with balances and of securitized receivables were for accounts with origination dates greater than months old 
as of december   our allowance for doubtful accounts related to on balance sheet private label credit card receivables was million compared to million as of december  delinquencies 
a credit card account is contractually delinquent if we do not receive the minimum payment by the specified due date on the cardholder s statement 
it is our policy to continue to accrue interest and fee income on all credit card accounts  except in limited circumstances  until the account balance and all related interest and other fees are charged off or paid  beyond days delinquent 
when an account becomes delinquent  we print a message on the cardholder s billing statement requesting payment 
after an account becomes days past due  a proprietary collection scoring algorithm automatically scores the risk of the account rolling to a more delinquent status 
the collection system then recommends a collection strategy for the past due account based on the collection score and account balance and dictates the contact schedule and collections priority for the account 
our proprietary system will zero out a customer s credit limit when charging privileges are removed from the account 
if we are unable to make a collection after exhausting all in house efforts  we engage collection agencies and outside attorneys to continue those efforts 

table of contents the following table presents the delinquency trends of our managed credit card portfolio december  of december  of total total in thousands  except percentages receivables outstanding receivables balances contractually delinquent to days to days or more days total net charge offs 
net charge offs comprise the principal amount of losses from cardholders unwilling or unable to pay their account balances  as well as bankrupt and deceased cardholders  less current period recoveries 
the following table presents our net charge offs for the periods indicated on a managed basis 
average managed receivables represents the average balance of the cardholder receivables  excluding those for which we do not bear the risk of loss  at the beginning of each month in the year indicated 
year ended december  in thousands  except percentages average managed receivables net charge offs net charge offs as a percentage of average managed receivables we believe  consistent with our statistical models and other credit analyses  that our net charge off ratio will continue to fluctuate

we have historically generated cash flows from operations  although that amount may vary based on fluctuations in working capital and the timing of merchant settlement activity 
our operating cash flow is seasonal  with cash utilization peaking at the end of december due to increased activity in our credit services segment related to holiday retail sales 

table of contents year ended december  in thousands cash provided by operating activities before changes in credit card portfolio activity and merchant settlement activity net change in credit card portfolio activity net change in merchant settlement activity cash provided by operating activities net change in credit card portfolio activity represents the difference in portfolios purchased from new clients and their subsequent sale to our securitization trusts 
there is typically a several month lag between the purchase and sale of credit card portfolios 
merchant settlement activity is driven by the number of days of float at the end of the period 
for these purposes  float means the difference between the number of days we hold cash before remitting the cash to our merchants and the number of days the card associations hold cash before remitting the cash to us 
merchant settlement activity fluctuates significantly depending on the day in which the period ends 
we generated cash flow from operating activities before changes in credit card portfolio activity and merchant settlement activity of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period in or a increase 
the increase in operating cash flows before changes in credit card portfolio activity and merchant settlement activity is primarily related to our increased earnings 
we utilize our cash flow from operations for ongoing business operations  acquisitions and capital expenditures 
investing activities 
we utilized cash flow from investing activities of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period in significant components of investing activities are as follows acquisitions 
during the year ended december   cash used in investing activities included payments for acquired businesses totaling million compared to million in  net of cash acquired 
in we acquired four businesses  which included doubleclick email solutions  icom  big designs  and cpc associates  all of which complemented and expanded our marketing services business 
in we acquired atrana and epsilon interactive 
securitizations and receivables funding 
we generally fund all private label credit card receivables through a securitization program that provides us with both liquidity and lower borrowing costs 
as of december   we had over billion of securitized credit card receivables 
securitizations require credit enhancements in the form of cash  spread accounts and additional receivables 
the credit enhancement is funded through the use of certificates of deposit issued through our subsidiary  world financial network national bank 
net securitization and credit card receivable activity utilized million for the year ended december  compared to million in we intend to utilize our securitization program for the foreseeable future 
capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the prior year 
capital expenditures for increased in support of systems development work for new client implementations and contracts added during the year along with information technology infrastructure enhancements 
we anticipate that capital expenditures will continue to remain at approximately of annual revenues for the foreseeable future 
financing activities 
our cash flows provided by financing activities were million in compared to million provided by financing activities in our financing activities for relate to borrowings and repayments of debt in the normal course of business and related business acquisitions  an increase in the repayment of certificates of deposit as we utilized proceeds from our credit card portfolio activity to reduce the balance of our certificates of deposit and million for the repurchase of our common stock on the open market  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 

table of contents liquidity sources 
in addition to cash generated by operating activities  we have four main sources of liquidity our securitization program  certificates of deposit issued by world financial network national bank  our credit facilities and senior notes  and issuances of equity securities 
we believe that internally generated funds and existing sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet current and anticipated financing requirements during the next months 
securitization program and off balance sheet transactions 
since january  we have sold  sometimes through wfn credit company  llc and wfn funding company ii  llc  substantially all of the credit card receivables owned by our credit card bank  world financial network national bank  to the wfn trusts as part of our securitization program 
this securitization program is the primary vehicle through which we finance our private label credit card receivables 
the following table shows expected maturities for borrowing commitments of the wfn trusts under our securitization program by year thereafter total in thousands public notes private conduits total represents borrowing capacity  not outstanding borrowings 
as of december   the wfn trusts had over billion of securitized credit card receivables 
securitizations require credit enhancements in the form of cash  spread deposits and additional receivables 
the credit enhancement is principally based on the outstanding balances of the series issued by the wfn trusts and by the performance of the private label credit cards in the securitization trust 
during the period from november to january  the wfn trusts are required to maintain a credit enhancement level of between and of securitized credit card receivables 
certain of the wfn trusts are required to maintain a level of between and for the remainder of the year 
accordingly  at december  the wfn trusts typically have their highest balance of credit enhancement assets as a result of the increased balances during the holiday season 
we intend to utilize our securitization program for the foreseeable future 
if world financial network national bank were not able to regularly securitize the receivables it originates  our ability to grow or even maintain our credit services business would be materially impaired as we would be severely limited in our financing ability 
world financial network national bank s ability to effect securitization transactions is impacted by the following factors  some of which are beyond our control conditions in the securities markets in general and the asset backed securitization market in particular  conformity in the quality of credit card receivables to rating agency requirements and changes in those requirements  and our ability to fund required overcollateralizations or credit enhancements  which we routinely utilize in order to achieve better credit ratings to lower our borrowing costs 
we believe that the conditions to securitize private label credit card receivables are favorable for us 
we plan to continue using our securitization program as our primary financing vehicle 
once world financial network national bank securitizes receivables  the agreement governing the transaction contains covenants that address the receivables performance and the continued solvency of the retailer where the underlying sales were generated 
in the event one of those or other similar covenants is breached  an early amortization event could be declared  in which case the trustee for the securitization trust would retain world financial network national bank s interest in the related receivables  along with the excess interest income that would normally be paid to world financial network national bank  until such time as the securitization investors are fully repaid 
the occurrence of an early amortization event would significantly limit  or even negate  our ability to securitize additional receivables 

table of contents certificates of deposit 
we utilize certificates of deposit to finance the operating activities and fund the securitization enhancement requirements of our credit card bank subsidiaries  world financial network national bank and world financial capital bank

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our primary market risks include off balance sheet risk  interest rate risk  credit risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk and redemption reward risk 
off balance sheet risk 
we are subject to off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business  including commitments to extend credit and through our securitization program 
we sell substantially all of our credit card receivables to the wfn trusts  qualifying special purpose entities 
the trusts enter into interest rate swaps to reduce the interest rate sensitivity of the securitization transactions 
the securitization program involves elements of credit  market  interest rate  legal and operational risks in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet through our retained interests in the securitization and the interest only strips 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk affects us directly in our lending and borrowing activities 
our total interest incurred was approximately million for  which includes both on and off balance sheet transactions 
of this total  million of the interest expense for was attributable to on balance sheet indebtedness and the remainder to our securitized credit card receivables  which are financed off balance sheet 
to manage our risk from market interest rates  we actively monitor the interest rates and the interest sensitive components both on and off balance sheet to minimize the impact that changes in interest rates have on the fair value of assets  net income and cash flow 
to achieve this objective  we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates by matching asset and liability repricings and through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements 
in addition  we enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and treasury locks to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable debt 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for trading or other speculative purposes 
at december   we had billion of debt  including billion of off balance sheet debt from our securitization program 
as of december  fixed rate variable rate total in millions off balance sheet on balance sheet at december   our fixed rate off balance sheet debt was locked at a current effective interest rate of through interest rate swap agreements 
additionally  our variable rate off balance sheet debt has variable rate credit cards that are at least equal to that amount 
at december   our fixed rate on balance sheet debt was subject to fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 
the approach we use to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis which we believe best reflects the risk inherent in our business 
this approach calculates the impact on pretax income from an instantaneous and sustained increase in interest rates of 
in  a increase in interest rates would have resulted in an annual decrease to pretax income of approximately million 
conversely  a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase to pretax income 
our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of financial instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions 

table of contents credit risk 
we are exposed to credit risk relating to the credit card loans we make to our clients customers 
our credit risk relates to the risk that consumers using the private label credit cards that we issue will not repay their revolving credit card loan balances 
we have developed credit risk models designed to identify qualified consumers who fit our risk parameters 
to minimize our risk of loan write offs  we control approval rates of new accounts and related credit limits and follow strict collection practices 
we monitor the buying limits  as well as set pricing regarding fees and interest rates charged 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and the canadian dollar through our significant canadian operations 
we do not hedge any of our net investment exposure in our canadian subsidiary 
a increase in the canadian exchange rate would have resulted in an increase in pretax income of million 
conversely  a corresponding decrease in the exchange rate would result in a comparable decrease to pretax income 
redemption reward risk 
through our air miles reward program  we are exposed to potentially increasing reward costs associated primarily with travel rewards
