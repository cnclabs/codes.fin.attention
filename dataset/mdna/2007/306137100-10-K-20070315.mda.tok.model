item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements can be identified by the use of predictive  future tense or forward looking terminology  such as believes  anticipates  expects  estimates  plans  may  intends  will  or similar terms 
investors are cautioned that any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve significant risks and uncertainties  and that actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview we were pleased with our continued revenue growth in our revenues for the full year increased to million from million in this is a thirty four percent year over year increase in revenues 
this increase was driven by sales of our core products 
we reached our revenue target for the year even though revenues from certain areas in which we had anticipated seeing growth  such as iscsi and the smb soho market  were not significant contributors to our revenue 
we believe that our ability to grow our revenues by thirty four percent even without significant contributions from these areas shows the strength of our core products 
we believe we are on the right track and we anticipate further revenue growth in we had a net loss of million in due to a change in accounting rules  it is difficult to compare this result with results in prior years 
new accounting rules that went into effect for us in required us to include in our consolidated financial statements an expense for the grant date fair value of share based compensation for the first time 
this expense which relates to stock options and restricted stock we grant to employees as part of our incentive compensation plan totaled million in as it has been in the past  our focus will continue to be on managing our business with a view towards long term success and growth 
in  we continued to invest in research and development and other areas to build on our momentum  to design new products  and to enhance our existing products to position the company for future growth 
we will continue to invest in these areas in and we anticipate that our research and development and sales and marketing expenses will increase in to continue to create industry leading  cutting edge network storage solutions  we hired additional software development engineers and quality assurance engineers 
these software engineers design and test the software products that are or will be sold by our oem partners and resellers 
continuing to deliver new and enhanced products to meet the demands of the storage market is necessary if we are to remain competitive and to continue our growth 
we also increased our sales force and our technical support team 
an increased sales force should expand the market exposure for our products 
the expanded technical support team responds to questions and technical issues from end users of our products and from our resellers and oem partners 
providing top notch technical support to these groups enhances our ability to continue to make sales 
end users who are satisfied with our technical support are more likely to order additional products from us 
resellers and oem partners who are happy with our technical support  and whose end users are satisfied  will be more likely to recommend our current products and less likely to consider other providers for future products 
the key factors we look to for our future business prospects continue to be our sales pipeline  our ability to establish and expand relationships with key industry oems and resellers  sales by our oem partners  additional orders from resellers  growth in deferred revenue  re orders from existing customers  and the growth of the overall market for storage solutions 
gross margins are also a key factor in evidencing the scalability of our business 
our sales pipeline consists of inquiries from end users and resellers for possible purchases of our products 
our overall sales pipeline steadily increased for each quarter of compared with the same quarter in oem relationships continue to be important to us for two main reasons first  sales by our oem partners contribute to our revenues 
overall  product licenses to oems accounted for approximately forty two percent of our revenues in one oem customer accounted for twenty seven percent of our revenues 
we anticipate that oems will account for over forty percent of our revenues in we expect that at least one oem will account for at least ten percent of our revenues in accordingly  the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our business 
second  having our products selected by respected  established industry leaders signals to customers  resellers and other potential oem partners that our products are quality products that add value to their enterprise 
before licensing software  oem partners typically undertake broad reviews of many of the competing software solutions available 
the choice of our products by major industry participants validates both the design and the capabilities of the products and our product roadmaps 
in  we renewed and extended our oem agreement with emc corporation  to emc also launched a new range of products that incorporate our vtl technology 
in we also extended our strategic relationship with sun microsystems by entering into a joint development agreement 
sun s next generation open systems virtual tape solution will incorporate falconstor s vtl technology 
in  we entered into oem agreements with other companies  including companies in asia and companies focused on the smb market  as discussed below 
we also renewed or extended agreements with existing oem partners 
we will continue to seek additional oem opportunities in the future 
we do everything we can to assure that our products meet the needs of our oem partners and their customers 
however  we cannot control decisions by our oem partners to change their product or marketing mix in ways that impact sales of products licensed by the oems from us 
over our history  we have entered into oem agreements with two tier oem companies  and with another significant company in the computer  networking and communications products business  only to see those oem partners change their strategies and make significant reductions in their commitments to the products that incorporate our technology 
many enterprises look to value added resellers or solution providers to assist them in making their information technology purchases 
these resellers typically review an enterprise s needs and suggest a hardware  software  or combined hardware and software solution to fulfill the enterprise s requirements 
as service providers to companies  resellers reputations are dependent on satisfying their customers needs efficiently and effectively 
resellers have wide choices in fulfilling their customers needs 
if resellers determine that a product they have been providing to their customers is not functioning as promised  or is not providing adequate return on investment  or if the customers are not satisfied with the level of support they are receiving from the suppliers  the resellers will move quickly to offer different solutions to their customers 
additional sales by resellers are therefore an important indicator of our business prospects 
sales from our resellers in the united states fell below our expectations in increasing sales from resellers is an area of focus for us 
steps we have taken to increase sales from resellers include the addition of sales  marketing and support personnel focused on those accounts 
we also have instituted  and we will be instituting further  support  training and incentive programs intended to increase sales by our resellers 
in  we signed agreements with new resellers worldwide 
we also terminated relationships with resellers who we believed were not properly selling our products 
we will continue to enter into relationships with resellers and to discontinue relationships with resellers with whom we are not satisfied 
our deferred revenues consist primarily of amounts attributable to future support and maintenance of our products 
the level of deferred revenue is an important indicator of our success 
maintenance and support for our products is sold for fixed periods of time 
maintenance and support agreements are typically for one year  although some agreements are for terms in excess of one year 
if we do not deliver the support needed by end users of our products or by our oem partners and resellers  then they will not renew their maintenance and support agreements 
if end users stop using our products  they also will not renew their maintenance and support agreements 
an increase in deferred revenues thus indicates growth in our installed base and end user and oem satisfaction with our products and our maintenance and support services 
our deferred revenue increased to million as of december   compared with million as of december  we expect deferred revenue to continue to grow in the level of re orders from existing end users of our products is another measure of customer satisfaction 
information technology professionals will only order additional products and services for their companies if they determine that the products have reduced total cost of ownership and have provided a good return on investment 
re orders are thus an indication that our products are delivering as promised and that our support is meeting the end user s needs 
in  many end users ordered additional copies of our products  or additional products or ordered additional options 
if re orders decline  it would indicate that future sales might also decline 
as the percentage of our revenues from oems increases  our ability to gauge re orders decreases because our oem partners typically do not provide us with information identifying the end user for each order 
consolidation in the network storage market continued in the consolidation did not have a significant impact on our revenue 
the storage solutions market continues to grow 
in addition to growth based on demand for storage server consolidation and replication  there was growth in backup acceleration 
we expect each of these areas to continue growing in in the fourth quarter of  we announced the launch of our primevault disaster recovery  services 
these services are based on our ipstor and virtualtape library vtl software and provide a means for us to leverage our successes with those products to increase our customer base to include end users who do not have the resources either technical or financial to undertake a full implementation of our products 
initially  we intended to offer these services directly to end users and through resellers 
in  we modified our approach to primevault so that we would no longer be the primary provider of the services 
instead  we now license the primevault services to third parties for resale to end users 
payment to us is based on either a revenue share or a fee based on the amount of storage managed by the third party 
primevault services did not provide significant revenue in  but we anticipate an increase in revenue in in and the beginning of  we launched initiatives in the small medium business smb and small office home office soho markets 
in early  we signed an oem agreement with a leading computer  networking and communications products manufacturer to offer an entry level data storage and protection appliance  powered by a version of ipstor optimized to run on a system on chip soc platform ipstor express  targeting the smb soho market 
shortly after the launch of the product  the oem partner announce a major strategic review of its operations and decided to scale back its commitment to this product line 
as a result of this change in strategy  revenues from our smb soho product line were lower than expected and were not significant 
we continue to believe that these non enterprise markets are another growth area for storage software and in we signed agreements with oem companies  both in the united states and abroad  whose product lines target these markets 
while we expect revenue growth in from our smb soho products  it is too early to estimate whether revenues from these markets will be significant contributors to our revenues in another area of focus for us in  and one that will remain an area of focus in  was the china market 
in  we signed an agreement with hangzhou huawei com technology co 
ltd  a leading global manufacturer of ip network solutions  to expand our strategic partnership in ip network storage to include joint r d activities in china and a multi year  multi million dollar commitment 
in  we also signed an oem agreement with a chinese company that is a leader in telecommunications networks 
in early  we signed a joint development and research agreement with the computer network information center  chinese academy of sciences cnic  cas to establish a laboratory to develop data protection and remote disaster recovery solutions for the chinese government and enterprises with the goal of providing our primevault data protection services throughout china 
as we had anticipated  we saw the greatest increase in revenues from our virtualtape library software 
we expect this growth to continue  if not accelerate  in  as our oem partners introduce new products and as we introduce additional features and functionality for the product 
the continued decline in prices for disk storage  and the continuing need for rapid back up  disaster recovery and regulatory compliance  should contribute to this growth 
another important measure of our business is gross margin 
among other things  gross margin measures our ability to scale our business 
unlike manufacturers of hardware  our incremental cost for each additional unit of software licensed is a small percentage of the software license revenue 
thus  our gross margins tend to increase as our software license revenue increases 
we incur research and development expenses before the product is offered for licensing 
these expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for engineering and testing  but also include other items such as the cost of hardware and software used in development 
we also have expenses for software support  sales and marketing  and general and administrative functions 
our gross margins for were 
due to the change in accounting rules regarding share based compensation as discussed above  a direct comparison with our gross margins in is not meaningful 
the impact of the equity based compensation expense on gross margin in was equivalent to 
we believe that our gross margin in demonstrates that we were successful in our ability to scale our business 
we believe the change in accounting rules also makes any comparison of expenses in and not meaningful 
nonetheless  we are pleased with our ability to contain the increase of expenses in excluding share based compensation expense  our expenses grew at a lower rate than our revenues 
we will continue to invest in infrastructure and personnel to maintain and enhance our leading edge designs and to support our customers  but we will continue to do so in a controlled  cost effective manner 
one additional factor that we expect to continue to affect our revenues on a quarterly  but not annual  basis  is the seasonality of the information technology business 
historically  information technology spending has been higher in the fourth and second quarters of each calendar year  and somewhat slower in the other quarters  particularly the first quarter 
our quarterly results reflected this seasonality in  and we anticipate that our quarterly results for will show the effects of seasonality as well 
as discussed above  the new accounting rules relating to share based compensation expense had a negative impact on our earnings in both before the rules became effective  and during  we weighed the impact of the changes on our consolidated financial statements against the impact of discontinuing the grant of equity based compensation to our worldwide workforce 
we decided that we will continue to apply the criteria and the methodology we have used in the past to determine grants of stock options or other equity based compensation to our employees 
we believe that the opportunity to participate in the growth of our company is an important motivating factor for our current employees and a valuable recruiting tool for new employees 
for the management of our business and the review of our progress  we will continue to look to our results before share based compensation expense 
we will use these non gaap financial measures in making operating decisions because they measure the results of our day to day operations and because they provide a more consistent basis for evaluating and comparing our results across different periods 
our critical accounting policies are those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable allowances  accounting for share based compensation and deferred income taxes 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended 
software license revenue is recognized only when pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the fee is fixed and determinable  among other criteria 
an arrangement is evidenced by a signed customer contract for nonrefundable royalty advances received from oems or a customer purchase order or a royalty report summarizing software licenses resold by an oem  distributor or solution provider to an end user 
the software license fees are fixed and determinable as our standard payment terms generally range from to days  depending on regional billing practices 
when a customer licenses software together with the purchase of maintenance  we allocate a portion of the fee to maintenance for its fair value 
we review accounts receivable to determine which are doubtful of collection 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for uncollectible accounts and returns  we consider historical return rates  specific past due accounts  analysis of our accounts receivable aging  customer payment terms  historical collections  write offs and returns  changes in customer demand and relationships  concentrations of credit risk and customer credit worthiness 
historically  we have experienced a somewhat consistent level of write offs and returns as a percentage of revenue due to our customer relationships  contract provisions and credit assessments 
changes in the product return rates  credit worthiness of customers  general economic conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write offs  revenues and our general and administrative expenses 
with the adoption of sfas no 
r on january   the company is required to record the fair value of share based compensation awards as an expense 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  the company applies the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
while the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions  typically based on factual data derived from public sources  the expected stock price volatility and expected term assumptions require a greater level of judgment 
we estimate expected stock price volatility based primarily on a simple average historical volatility of the underlying stock over a period equal to the expected term of the option  but also consider whether other factors are present that indicate that exclusive reliance on historical volatility may not be a reliable indicator of expected volatility 
with regard to our estimate of expected term  as adequate information with respect to historical share option exercise experience is not available  we primarily consider the vesting term and original contractual term of the options granted 
consistent with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we regularly estimate our ability to recover deferred income taxes  and report such assets at the amount that is determined to be more likely than not recoverable 
this evaluation considers several factors  including an estimate of the likelihood of generating sufficient taxable income in future periods over which temporary differences reverse  the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities  past and projected taxable income  and available tax planning strategies 
as of december   based primarily upon our cumulative losses  a valuation allowance has been recorded against our deferred tax assets 
in the event that evidence becomes available in the future to indicate that our deferred taxes will likely be recoverable eg  taxable income generated in and projected for future periods  our estimate of the recoverability of deferred taxes may change  resulting in a reversal of all or a portion of such valuation allowance 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared with million for the year ended december  our operating expenses increased from million in to million in included in our operating expenses for the year ended december  was million of share based payment compensation expense related to the implementation of sfas no 
r beginning january  for the year ended december   there was insignificant share based payment compensation expense 
net loss for the year ended december  was million compared with net income of million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was mainly due to an increase in i demand for our network storage solution software ii maintenance revenue from new and existing customers and iii sales from our resellers and oem partners 
revenue contribution from our oem partners increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of our total revenue for the year ended december  revenue from resellers and distributors also increased in absolute dollars 
expenses increased in all aspects of our business to support our growth 
for the year ended december   we increased the number of employees and continued to invest in our infrastructure by purchasing additional computers and equipment 
we increased the number of employees from as of december  to as of december  included in our results for the year ended december  is a litigation settlement charge of million relating to a contingent purchase price dispute associated with an acquisition we made in revenues software license revenue software license revenue is comprised of software licenses sold through our oems  value added resellers and distributors to end users and  to a lesser extent  directly to end users 
these revenues are recognized when  among other requirements  we receive a customer purchase order or a royalty report summarizing software licenses sold and the software and permanent key codes are delivered to the customer 
we sometimes receive nonrefundable royalty advances and engineering fees from some of our oem partners 
these arrangements are evidenced by a signed customer contract  and the revenue is recognized when the software product master is delivered and accepted  and the engineering services  if any  have been performed 
software license revenue increased to million in from million in increased market acceptance and demand for our product and increased sales from our resellers and oem partners were the primary drivers of the increase in software license revenue 
revenue from our oem partners increased as a percentage of total revenue 
we expect our software license revenue to continue to grow and the percentage of future software license revenue derived from our oem partners to increase 
maintenance  software services and other revenue maintenance  software services and other revenues are comprised of software maintenance and technical support  professional services primarily related to the implementation of our software  engineering services  and sales of computer hardware 
revenue derived from maintenance and technical support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual maintenance term 
professional services revenue is recognized in the period that the related services are performed 
revenue from engineering services is primarily related to customizing software product masters for some of our oem partners 
revenue from engineering services is recognized in the period the services are completed 
in and  we had a limited number of transactions in which we purchased hardware and bundled this hardware with our software and sold the bundled solution to our customer 
a portion of the contractual fees is recognized as revenue when the hardware or software is delivered to the customer based on the relative fair value of the delivered element s 
maintenance  software services and other revenue increased to million in from million in the major factor behind the increase in maintenance  software services and other revenue was an increase in the number of maintenance and technical support contracts we sold 
as we are in business longer  and as we license more software  we expect these revenues will continue to increase 
the majority of our new customers purchase maintenance and support and most customers renew their maintenance and support after their initial contracts expire 
maintenance revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  software services and other revenue increased from million in to million in the increase in software services and other revenue was partially attributable to our hardware sales which increased from million in to million in this increase was the result of an increase in demand from our customers for bundled solutions 
growth in our professional services sales  which increased from million in to million in  also contributed to the increase in software services and other revenues 
this increase in professional services revenue was related to the increase in our software license customers who elected to purchase professional services 
we expect maintenance  software services and other revenues to continue to increase 
cost of revenues amortization of purchased and capitalized software to remain successful in the network storage solutions market  we must continually upgrade our software by enhancing the existing features of our products and by adding new features and products 
we often evaluate whether to develop these new offerings in house or whether we can achieve a greater return on investment by purchasing or licensing software from third parties 
based on our evaluations  we have purchased or licensed various software for resale since as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of purchased software licenses that are being amortized over three years 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of amortization related to these purchased software licenses 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of amortization related to these purchased software licenses 
we will continue to evaluate third party software licenses and may make additional purchases  which would result in an increase in amortization expense 
cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue cost of maintenance  software services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel costs  other costs associated with providing software implementations  technical support under maintenance contracts and training  and share based payment compensation expense associated with the implementation of sfas no 
r 
cost of maintenance  software services and other revenues also includes the cost of hardware that was resold 
cost of maintenance  software services and other revenues for the year ended december  increased by to million compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue was partially due to million of share based payment compensation expense 
there was no share based payment compensation expense included in cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue for the year ended december  additionally  cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue increased due to an increase in personnel 
as a result of our increased sales of maintenance and support contracts and professional services  we hired additional employees to provide technical support and to implement our software 
additionally  due to an increase in hardware sales  our associated hardware costs increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue will continue to grow in absolute dollars as our revenue increases 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million or of revenues compared with million or of revenues for the year ended december  gross margin remained consistent despite the inclusion of share based payment compensation expense in the cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue for the year ended december  share based payment compensation expense was equal to of revenue for the year ended december  software development costs software development costs consist primarily of personnel costs for product development personnel  share based payment compensation expense associated with the implementation of sfas no 
r  and costs associated with the development of new products  enhancements to existing products  quality assurance and testing 
software development costs increased to million in from million in the major contributing factor to the increase in software development costs was million of share based payment compensation expense 
there was no share based payment compensation expense included in software development costs for the year ended december  the increase is also due to an increase in employees required to enhance and test our core network storage software product  as well as to develop new innovative features and options 
in addition  we required additional employees to test and integrate our software with our oem partners products 
we intend to continue recruiting and hiring product development personnel to support our software development process 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing personnel costs  share based payment compensation expense associated with the implementation of sfas no 
r  travel  public relations expense  marketing literature and promotions  commissions  trade show expenses  and the costs associated with our foreign sales offices 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in selling and marketing expenses was partially due to million of share based payment compensation expense 
there was insignificant share based payment compensation expense included in selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december  in addition  we continued to hire new sales and sales support personnel and to expand our worldwide presence to accommodate our revenue growth 
as a result of the increase in revenue and interest in our software  our commission expense and travel expenses also increased 
we believe that to continue to grow sales  our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of general and administrative functions  share based payment compensation expense associated with the implementation of sfas no 
r  public company related costs  directors and officers insurance  legal and professional fees and other general corporate overhead costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the major contributing factor to the increase in general and administrative expenses was million of share based payment compensation expense 
there was no share based payment compensation expense included in general and administrative expense for the year ended december  additionally  as our revenue and number of employees increase  our legal and professional fees and other general corporate overheard costs have increased and are likely to continue to increase 
litigation settlement charge in january  we resolved claims brought against us by two former shareholders of ip metrics  inc ip metrics 
when we purchased ip metrics in july  part of the contractual consideration was payments to be made in and to the former ip metrics shareholders based on sales of ip metrics products and or payments to be made if certain events occurred 
we made payments to all four former shareholders in and two of the former shareholders alleged that they were entitled to additional payments based on the alleged occurrence of certain contingent events and they brought an action against us 
this action was resolved in january  without any admission of liability  by the payment of an additional million to the two former shareholders 
this amount was recorded as an operating expense as of december  all claims in the lawsuit have now been dismissed 
interest and other income we invest our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in government securities and other low risk investments 
interest and other income increased to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to a higher average cash balance and higher interest rates 
income taxes we did not record a tax benefit associated with our pre tax loss incurred for the year ended december   as we deemed that it was uncertain that the related deferred tax assets would be realized based on our cumulative losses incurred since inception and our limited period of profitability 
for the year ended december   our pre tax income was substantially offset by available net operating losses 
our income tax provision for and consists of taxes related to alternative minimum taxes  state income taxes  and taxes from our foreign subsidiaries 
in  in the event that we continue to generate taxable income and our forecasts indicate that it is more likely than not that we will recover a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  we will likely reverse a portion of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance

in  we made investments in our infrastructure to support our long term growth 
we increased the total number of employees in and made investments in property and equipment to support our growth 
as we continue to grow  we will continue to make investments in property and equipment and will need to continue to increase our headcount 
in the past  we have also used cash to purchase software licenses and to make acquisitions 
we will continue to evaluate potential software license purchases and acquisitions and if the right opportunity presents itself we may continue to use our cash for these purposes 
however  as of the date of this filing  we have no agreements  commitments or understandings with respect to any such acquisitions 
we currently do not have any debt and our only significant commitments are related to our office leases
