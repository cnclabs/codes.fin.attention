item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this report 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of therapeutic products for diseases such as diabetes and cancer 
we are currently in phase clinical trials in the united states  europe and latin america of our lead product  the technosphere insulin system  to study its safety and efficacy in the treatment of diabetes 
this dry powder therapy consists of our proprietary technosphere particles onto which insulin are loaded 
these loaded particles are then aerosolized and inhaled into the deep lung using our proprietary inhaler 
we believe that the combination of the performance characteristics  unique kinetics  convenience and ease of use of the technosphere insulin system may have the potential to change the way diabetes is treated 
we are developing additional applications for our proprietary technosphere platform technology by formulating other drugs for pulmonary delivery 
we are also developing therapies for the treatment of solid tumor cancers 
our other product candidates are in research and pre clinical development 
we are a development stage enterprise and have incurred significant losses since our inception in as of december   we have incurred a cumulative net loss of million 
to date  we have not generated any product revenues and have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities 
we do not anticipate sales of any product prior to regulatory approval and commercialization of our technosphere insulin system 
we currently do not have the required approvals to market any of our product candidates  and we may not receive such approvals 
we may not be profitable even if we succeed in commercializing any of our product candidates 
we expect to make substantial and increasing expenditures and to incur additional operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue the clinical development and commercialization of our technosphere insulin system for the treatment of diabetes  expand our manufacturing operations for our technosphere insulin system to meet our currently anticipated commercial production needs  expand our other research  discovery and development programs  expand our proprietary technosphere platform technology and develop additional applications for the pulmonary delivery of other drugs  and enter into sales and marketing collaborations with other companies  if available on commercially reasonable terms  or develop these capabilities ourselves 

table of contents our business is subject to significant risks  including but not limited to the risks inherent in our ongoing clinical trials and the regulatory approval process  the results of our research and development efforts  competition from other products and technologies and uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patent rights 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist mainly of costs associated with the clinical trials of our product candidates which have not yet received regulatory approval for marketing and for which no alternative future use has been identified 
this includes the salaries  benefits and stock based compensation of research and development personnel  laboratory supplies and materials  facility costs  costs for consultants and related contract research  licensing fees  and depreciation of laboratory equipment 
we track research and development costs by the type of cost incurred 
we partially offset research and development expenses with the recognition of estimated amounts receivable from the state of connecticut pursuant to a program under which we can exchange qualified research and development income tax credits for cash 
our research and development staff conducts our internal research and development activities  which include research  product development  clinical development  manufacturing and related activities 
this staff is located in our facilities in valencia  california  paramus  new jersey  and danbury  connecticut 
we expense the majority of research and development costs as we incur them 
clinical development timelines  likelihood of success and total costs vary widely 
we are focused primarily on advancing the technosphere insulin system through phase clinical trials and regulatory filings 
we plan to commercialize our lead product as a treatment for diabetes 
based on the results of preclinical studies  we plan to develop additional applications of our technosphere technology 
additionally  we anticipate that we will continue to determine which research and development projects to pursue  and how much funding to direct to each project  on an ongoing basis  in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate 
we cannot be certain when any revenues from the commercialization of our products will commence 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early stage of development of our product candidates other than the technosphere insulin system  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates for commercialization 
the costs required to complete the development of our technosphere insulin system will be largely dependent on the scope of our clinical trials  the cost and efficiency of our manufacturing process and discussions with the fda on its requirements 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses  particularly for the technosphere insulin system  will increase significantly with the continuation of existing clinical trials  the initiation of new trials  the resulting manufacturing costs associated with producing clinical trial materials  and the expansion  qualification and validation of our commercial manufacturing processes and facilities 
additionally  we expect non cash stock based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statement and sfas no 
r  effective as of january   to increase in the future 
see note summary of significant accounting policies stock based compensation in the notes to our financial statements 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and stock based compensation for administrative  finance  business development  human resources  legal and information systems support personnel 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include business insurance and professional services costs 
we expect general and administrative expenses other than non cash stock based compensation expense to increase slightly in the future as a result of increased headcount  public company compliance and establishment of investor relations and marketing programs 
we expect overall general and administrative expenses to increase significantly as a result of the adoption of sfas no

table of contents critical accounting policies we have based our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making estimates of expenses such as stock option expenses and judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the significant accounting policies that are critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in more detail below 
impairment of long lived assets assessing long lived assets for impairment requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets  a determination that the carrying value of such assets cannot be recovered through undiscounted cash flows  loss of legal ownership or title to the assets  or the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we believe our assets to be impaired  the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
any write downs would be treated as permanent reductions in the carrying amount of the asset and an operating loss would be recognized 
in addition  we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the useful lives of the assets 
if a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates  our reported results could materially change 
to date  we have had recurring operating losses  and the recoverability of our long lived assets is contingent upon executing our business plan 
if we are unable to execute our business plan  we may be required to write down the value of our long lived assets in future periods 
clinical trial expenses our clinical trial accrual process seeks to account for expenses resulting from our obligations under contract with vendors  consultants  and clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials 
the financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts 
our objective is to reflect the appropriate trial expenses in our financial statements by matching period expenses with period services and efforts expended 
we account for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial 
we determine accrual estimates through discussions with internal clinical personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of trials  or the services completed 
service provider status is then compared to the contractual obligated fee to be paid for such services 
during the course of a clinical trial  we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for a period would be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of the services are often judgmental 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

table of contents stock based compensation on january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

prior to january   the company accounted for employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and adopted the disclosure only alternative of sfas no 
sfas no 
r eliminated the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options which the company followed until december  further  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options and the compensatory elements of employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized in the income statement based upon the fair value of the awards at the grant date 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  the company selected the modified prospective transition method whereby unvested awards at the date of adoption  as well as awards that are granted  modified or settled after the date of adoption  will be measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
r 
measurement and attribution of compensation cost for awards unvested as of january  is based on the same estimate of the grant date or modification date fair value and the same attribution method straight line used previously under sfas no 
our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  reflect the impact of sfas no 
r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
if not for the adoption of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation expense under apb no 
would have been approximately million for the year ended december  the adoption of sfas no 
r in resulted in an increase in stock based compensation expense of million for a total of million of stock based compensation for the year ended december  accounting for income taxes we must make significant management judgments when determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we have established a valuation allowance of million against all of our net deferred tax asset balance  due to uncertainties related to our deferred tax assets as a result of our history of operating losses 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to change the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues during the year ended december   the company recognized million in revenue under a license agreement 
no revenues were recorded for the year ended december  we do not anticipate sales of any product prior to regulatory approval and commercialization of our technosphere insulin system 

table of contents research and development expenses the following table provides a comparison of the research and development expense categories for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  change change clinical manufacturing research research and development tax credit stock based compensation expense benefit research and development expenses the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to increased costs associated with the expanded clinical development of our technosphere insulin system and the continuation of other preclinical studies  increased salaries and related expenses driven by higher headcount  increases in consulting services and technology agreements  and increases in stock based compensation expense 
the increase in stock based compensation expense was due to the adoption of sfas r on january  and the stock based compensation benefit in resulting from the fluctuation of our stock price on the stock options that were repriced in november we anticipate that our research and development expenses associated with our technosphere insulin system  expanding our technosphere platform technology and the pursuit of cancer therapies will increase significantly in specifically  we anticipate increased expenses related to the continuation of existing and initiation of new clinical trials  and the resulting manufacturing costs associated with producing clinical trial materials 
the research and development tax credit recognized for the years ended december  and partially offsets our research and development expenses 
the state of connecticut provides an opportunity to exchange certain research and development income tax credit carryforwards for cash in exchange for forgoing the carryforward of the research and development credits 
estimated amounts receivable under the program are recorded as a reduction of research and development expenses

table of contents years ended december  and revenues no revenues were recorded for the years ended december  or research and development expenses the following table provides a comparison of the research and development expense categories for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  change change clinical manufacturing research research and development tax credit stock based compensation expense research and development expenses the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to ongoing expenses related to the clinical development of our technosphere insulin system 
the expansion of our phase clinical trial program for our technosphere insulin system and the continuation of other preclinical studies significantly increased our clinical research expenditures in this also resulted in increased technosphere insulin manufacturing costs to supply clinical trial materials 
we continue to expand our qualification and validation of our manufacturing system 
additionally  research activities related to toxicology studies for our technosphere insulin system  expanding our proprietary technosphere platform technology  developing additional applications for the pulmonary delivery of other drugs and the discovery and development of programs primarily focused on cancer therapies resulted in increased research expenditures 
the research and development tax credit recognized for the years ended december  and partially offsets our research and development expenses 
the state of connecticut provides an opportunity to exchange certain research and development income tax credit carryforwards for cash in exchange for forgoing the carryforward of the research and development credits 
estimated amounts receivable under the program are recorded as a reduction of research and development expenses 
during the years ended december  and  research and development expenses were offset by million and million  respectively  in connection with the program 
the three months ended september  was the first period in which we were able to recognize the benefit of these credits for financial reporting purposes and accordingly the million recognized in the year ended december  included amounts attributable to and prior years 
the decrease in stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily resulted from the effect of the decrease of our stock price from december  to december  a significant portion of the compensation expense is tied to the stock options that were repriced in november as the compensation cost for all repriced options was measured on a quarterly basis until the options expired or were exercised or canceled 

table of contents general and administrative expenses the following table provides a comparison of the general and administrative expense categories for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  change change salaries  employee related and other general expenses stock based compensation expense general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased as compared to the year ended december  increased administrative services resulted in increased headcount  compensation adjustments and other employee related expenses 
additionally  litigation  public company compliance including the sarbanes oxley act and our establishment of a marketing function in increased both professional fees and consulting expenses 
offsetting increases to general and administrative expenses for these periods was a decrease in stock based compensation expense resulting from the effect of the fluctuation of our stock price on the valuation of stock options that were repriced in november deemed dividends deemed dividend for represents the beneficial conversion charge to common stockholders related to the downward adjustment of the series b and c preferred stock conversion price 
all outstanding preferred stock automatically converted into common stock at the close of the initial public offering in the third quarter of  and no further deemed dividend has been or will be recognized 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and a loan agreement with our principal stockholder 
on november   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec for the issuance by us of up to million of our equity and debt securities from time to time in one or more transactions 
on december   we closed the sale of  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share and on december   closed the sale of an additional  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per shares pursuant to an over allotment option granted to the underwriters of the offering 
the resulting aggregate net proceeds to us from this common stock offering was approximately million after expenses 
on december   we also sold million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due  which included million aggregate principal amount of the notes sold to cover over allotments 
the resulting aggregate net proceeds to us from this note offering was approximately million after expenses 
during the year ended december   we used million of cash for our operations compared to using million for our operations in the year ended december  we had a net loss of million for the year ended december   of which million consisted of non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  and other stock based charges pursuant to a research agreement 
we expect our negative operating cash flow to continue at least until we obtain regulatory approval and achieve commercialization of our technosphere insulin system 
we used million of cash for investing activities during the year ended december   compared to using million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities was primarily from net purchases of marketable securities of million and million used to purchase machinery and equipment to expand our manufacturing operations and quality systems in support of our expansion of clinical trials for technosphere insulin system 
we expect to make significant purchases of equipment in the foreseeable future 
our financing activities provided cash of million for the year ended december  compared to million for cash from financing activities in was primarily from the equity and convertible note 
table of contents offerings in december and the exercise of stock options throughout the year 
for  cash from financing activities was primarily from the private placement in august as well as the exercise of stock options 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
although we believe our existing cash resources  including the net proceeds from the equity and convertible note offerings of december  and the million loan agreement with our principal stockholder  will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash requirements into the first quarter of  we will require significant additional financing in the future to fund our operations 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate expenditures for certain of our programs  including our technosphere insulin system development activities 
we intend to use our capital resources to continue the development of our technosphere insulin system and to develop additional applications for our proprietary technosphere platform technology 
in addition  portions of our capital resources will be devoted to expanding our other product development programs for the treatment of solid tumor cancers 
we anticipate that we will expend a portion of our capital to scale up our manufacturing capabilities in our danbury facilities 
we also intend to use our capital resources for general corporate purposes  which may include in licensing or acquiring additional technologies 
if we enter into a strategic business collaboration with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company  we would expect  as part of the transaction  to receive additional capital and reimbursements for a portion of the costs associated with the development  manufacture and commercialization of our technosphere insulin system 
in addition  we expect to pursue the sale of equity and or debt securities  or the establishment of other funding facilities 
issuances of debt or additional equity could impact the rights of our existing stockholders  dilute the ownership percentages of our existing stockholders and may impose restrictions on our operations 
these restrictions could include limitations on additional borrowing  specific restrictions on the use of our assets as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens  pay dividends  redeem our stock or make investments 
we also may seek to raise additional capital by pursuing opportunities for the licensing  sale or divestiture of certain intellectual property and other assets  including our technosphere technology platform 
there can be no assurance  however  that any strategic collaboration  sale of securities or sale or license of assets will be available to us on a timely basis or on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to raise additional capital  we may be required to enter into agreements with third parties to develop or commercialize products or technologies that we otherwise would have sought to develop independently  and any such agreements may not be on terms as commercially favorable to us 
however  we cannot provide assurances that our plans will not change or that changed circumstances will not result in the depletion of our capital resources more rapidly than we currently anticipate 
if planned operating results are not achieved or we are not successful in raising additional equity financing or entering a business collaboration  we may be required to reduce expenses through the delay  reduction or curtailment of our projects  including our technosphere insulin system development activities  or further reduction of costs for facilities and administration 
effects of inflation our assets are primarily monetary  consisting of cash and cash equivalents 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
we also believe that we have intangible assets in the value of our technology 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we have not capitalized the value of this intellectual property on our consolidated balance sheet 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our cash resources 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents commitments and contingencies our contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments 
accordingly  the table below excludes contractual obligations relating to milestone and royalty payments due to third parties  all of which are contingent upon certain future events 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information 
future payments relate to operating lease obligations including facility leases executed in march and november  the senior convertible notes  and open purchase commitments consisted of the following at december  in thousands payments due in less than or more contractual obligations one year years years years total open purchase order commitments senior convertible note obligations operating lease obligations total contractual obligations the amounts included in open purchase order commitments are subject to performance under the purchase order by the supplier of the goods or services and do not become our obligation until such performance is rendered 
the amount shown is principally for the purchase of materials for our clinical trials  the acquisition of manufacturing equipment and commitments related to our manufacturing plant expansion 
the senior convertible note obligation amounts include future interest payments at a fixed rate of and payment of the notes in full upon maturity in related party transactions for a description of our related party transactions see note certain relationships and related party transactions in the notes to our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions 
fin addresses the recognition and measurement of uncertain income tax positions using a more likely than not threshold and will also require enhanced disclosures in the financial statements 
the provisions of fin are effective for us beginning january  we are currently evaluating the impact of this interpretation on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 
on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not used derivative financial instruments 
however  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
our current policy is to maintain a highly liquid short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of us money market funds and government and investment grade corporate debt 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
our short term investments are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by ten percent from levels at december   we estimate that the fair value of our investment portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount
