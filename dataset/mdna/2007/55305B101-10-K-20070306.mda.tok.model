application of critical accounting estimates and policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates such estimates and judgments and makes adjustments as deemed necessary 
actual results could differ from these estimates using different estimates and assumptions  or if conditions are significantly different in the future 
listed below are those estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of a home is recognized when the closing has occurred  title has passed and an adequate initial and continuing investment by the homebuyer is received  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate sfas  or when the loan has been sold to a third party investor 
revenue for homes that close to the buyer having a deposit of or greater  home closings financed by third parties  and all home closings insured under fha or va government insured programs are recorded in the financial statements on the date of closing 
revenue related to all other home closings initially funded by our wholly owned subsidiary  m i financial corp 
m i financial  is recorded on the date that m i financial sells the loan to a third party investor  because the receivable from the third party investor is not subject to future subordination and the company has transferred to this investor the usual risks and rewards of ownership that is in substance a sale and does not have a substantial continuing involvement with the home  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas 
all associated homebuilding costs are charged to cost of sales in the period when the revenues from home closings are recognized 
homebuilding costs include land and land development costs  home construction costs including an estimate of the costs to complete construction  previously capitalized interest  real estate taxes and indirect costs  and estimated warranty costs 
all other costs are expensed as incurred 
sales incentives  including pricing discounts and financing costs paid by the company  are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the company s consolidated statement of income 
sales incentives in the form of options or upgrades are recorded in homebuilding costs in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of a vendor s products 
we recognize the majority of the revenue associated with our mortgage loan operations when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors 
we defer the application and origination fees  net of costs  and recognize them as revenue  along with the associated gains or losses on the sale of the loans and related servicing rights  when the loans are sold to third party investors in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans 
the revenue recognized is reduced by the fair value of the related guarantee provided to the investor 
the guarantee fair value is recognized in revenue when the company is released from its obligation under the guarantee 
generally  all of the financial services mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors within two weeks of origination 
we recognize financial services revenue associated with our title operations as homes are closed  closing services are rendered and title policies are issued  all of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed 
all of the underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies is transferred to third party insurers 
inventories 
we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating costs associated with land acquisition and development and home construction 
inventories are recorded at cost  unless events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the land may be impaired 
in addition to the costs of direct land acquisition  land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred and home construction costs  inventories include capitalized interest  real estate taxes and certain indirect costs incurred during land development and home construction 
such costs are charged to cost of sales simultaneously with revenue recognition  as discussed above 
when a home is closed  we typically have not yet paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home 
as homes close  we compare the home construction budget to actual recorded costs to date to estimate the additional costs to be incurred from our subcontractors related to the home 
we record a liability and a corresponding charge to cost of sales for the amount we estimate will ultimately be paid related to that home 
we monitor the accuracy of such estimate by comparing actual costs incurred in subsequent months to the estimate 
although actual costs to complete in the future could differ from the estimate  our method has historically produced consistently accurate estimates of actual costs to complete closed homes 
we assess inventories for recoverability in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in local or national economic conditions indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
for existing communities and raw land or land under development that management intends to use in homebuilding activities  the recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset based on the sale of a home 
if these assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
for land that meets the criteria of held for sale  the company records the land held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
in accordance with sfas  land held for sale criteria are as follows management  having the authority to approve the action  commits to a plan to sell the asset  the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets  an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset have been initiated  the sale of the asset is probable  and transfer of the asset is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale  within one year  the asset is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value  and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn 
in performing the impairment evaluation  management uses estimates of the future projected sales price and sales pace of each existing or planned community  along with the estimated land development and home construction costs of the community and a risk adjusted interest rate to discount future cash flows 
we have used a discount rate ranging from in our impairment analyses as of december  from a sensitivity standpoint  we have estimated that a hypothetical increase in the risk adjusted interest rate used to discount future cash flows would impact our impairment charge by approximately million 
we generally believe that we will see a gradual improvement in market conditions over the long term and these assumptions are incorporated into our projections as of december  because of the high degree of judgment involved in developing these assumptions  it is possible that the company may determine the land or community is not impaired in the current period  but due to the passage of time or use of different assumptions  impairment could exist 
consolidated inventory not owned 
we enter into land option agreements in the ordinary course of business in order to secure land for the construction of homes in the future 
pursuant to these land option agreements  we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future  usually at pre determined prices 
if the entity holding the land under option is a variable interest entity  the company s deposit including letters of credit represents a variable interest in the entity  and we must use our judgment to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of the entity 
factors considered in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary include the amount of the deposit in relation to the fair value of the land  expected timing of our purchase of the land and assumptions about projected cash flows 
we consider our accounting policies with respect to determining whether we are the primary beneficiary to be critical accounting policies due to the judgment required 
investment in unconsolidated limited liability companies 
we invest in entities that acquire and develop land for distribution or sale to us in connection with our homebuilding operations 
in our judgment  we have determined that these entities generally do not meet the criteria of variable interest entities because they have sufficient equity to finance their operations 
we must use our judgment to determine if we have substantive control over these entities 
if we were to determine that we have substantive control over an entity  we would be required to consolidate the entity 
factors considered in determining whether we have substantive control or exercise significant influence over an entity include risk and reward sharing  experience and financial condition of the other partners  voting rights  involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions and continuing involvement 
in the event an entity does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations  we would be required to use judgment to determine if we were the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity 
we consider our accounting policies with respect to determining whether we are the primary beneficiary or have substantive control or exercise significant influence over an entity to be critical accounting policies due to the judgment required 
based on the application of our accounting policies  these entities are accounted for by the equity method of accounting 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of investments in common stock  and sec staff accounting bulletin topic m  other than temporary impairment of certain investments in debt and equity securities  the company evaluates its investment in unconsolidated limited liability companies for potential impairment on a continuous basis 
if the fair value of the investment is less than the investment carrying value  and the company has determined that the decline in value is other than temporary  the company would write down the value of the investment to fair value 
the determination of whether an investment s fair value is less than the carrying value requires management to make certain assumptions regarding the amount and timing of future contributions to the limited liability company  the timing of distribution or sale of lots to the company from the limited liability company  the projected fair value of the lots at the time of distribution or sale to the company and the estimated proceeds from  and timing of  the sale of land or lots to third parties 
in addition to the assumptions management must make to determine if the investment s fair value is less than the carrying value  management must also use judgment in determining whether the impairment is other than temporary 
the factors management considers are the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the company  and the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the limited liability company for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
because of the high degree of judgment involved in developing these assumptions  it is possible that the company may determine the investment is not impaired in the current period  but due to passage of time or use of different assumptions  impairment could exist 
guarantees and indemnities 
guarantee and indemnity liabilities are established by charging the applicable income statement or balance sheet line  depending on the nature of the guarantee or indemnity  and crediting a liability 
m i financial provides a limited life guarantee on loans sold to certain third parties  and estimates its actual liability related to the guarantee  and any indemnities subsequently provided to the purchaser of the loans in lieu of loan repurchase  based on historical loss experience 
actual future costs associated with loans guaranteed or indemnified could differ materially from our current estimated amounts 
the company has also provided certain other guarantees and indemnifications in connection with the purchase and development of land  including environmental indemnifications  guarantees of the completion of land development  a loan maintenance and limited payment guaranty and minimum net worth guarantees of certain subsidiaries 
the company estimates these liabilities based on the estimated cost of insurance coverage or estimated cost of acquiring a bond in the amount of the exposure 
actual future costs associated with these guarantees and indemnifications could differ materially from our current estimated amounts 
warranty 
warranty accruals are established by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty accrual for each home closed 
the amounts charged are estimated by management to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs for materials and outside labor required under the company s warranty programs 
accruals for warranties under our two year limited warranty program and our year for homes closed prior to and year for homes closed during or after structural warranty program are established as a percentage of average sales price and on a per unit basis  respectively  and are based upon historical experience by geographic area and recent trends 
factors that are given consideration in determining the accruals include the historical range of amounts paid per average sales price on a home  type and mix of amenity packages added to the home  any warranty expenditures included in the above not considered to be normal and recurring  timing of payments  improvements in quality of construction expected to impact future warranty expenditures  actuarial estimates prepared by an independent third party  which considers both company and industry data  and conditions that may affect certain projects and require a different percentage of average sales price for those specific projects 
changes in estimates for pre existing warranties occur due to changes in the historical payment experience  and are also due to differences between the actual payment pattern experienced during the period and the historical payment pattern used in our evaluation of the warranty accrual balance at the end of each quarter 
actual future warranty costs could differ from our current estimated amount 
self insurance 
self insurance accruals are made for estimated liabilities associated with employee health care  ohio workers compensation and general liability insurance 
our self insurance limit for employee health care is  per claim per year for fiscal  with stop loss insurance covering amounts in excess of  up to  per claim per year 
our self insurance limit for workers compensation is  per claim with stop loss insurance covering all amounts in excess of this limit 
the accruals related to employee health care and workers compensation are based on historical experience and open cases 
our general liability claims are insured by a third party  the company generally has a million deductible per occurrence and million in the aggregate  with lower deductibles for certain types of claims 
the company records a general liability accrual for claims falling below the company s deductible 
the general liability accrual estimate is based on an actuarial evaluation of our past history of claims and other industry specific factors 
the company has recorded expenses totaling million  million and million  respectively  for all self insured and general liability claims during the years ended december   and because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated accrual amounts  actual future costs could differ from our current estimated amounts 
stock based compensation 
on january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires that companies measure and recognize compensation expense at an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments granted under compensation arrangements 
we calculate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions  which involve a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the expected dividend yield and the expected term of the option 
in addition  we also use judgment in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
derivative financial instruments 
to meet financing needs of our home buying customers  m i financial is party to interest rate lock commitments irlcs  which are extended to customers who have applied for a mortgage loan and meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria 
these irlcs are considered derivative financial instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
m i financial manages interest rate risk related to its irlcs and mortgage loans held for sale through the use of forward sales of mortgage backed securities fmbss  use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments and the occasional purchase of options on fmbss in accordance with company policy 
these fmbss  options on fmbss and irlcs covered by fmbss are considered non designated derivatives and  in accordance with sfas and related derivatives implementation group conclusions  are accounted for at fair value with gains or losses recorded in financial services revenue 
certain irlcs and mortgage loans held for sale are committed to third party investors through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments 
in accordance with sfas  the irlcs and related best efforts whole loan delivery commitments  which generally are highly effective from an economic standpoint  are considered non designated derivatives and are accounted for at fair value with gains or losses recorded in current earnings 
under the terms of these best efforts whole loan delivery commitments covering mortgage loans held for sale  the specific committed mortgage loans held for sale are identified and matched to specific delivery commitments on a loan by loan basis 
the delivery commitments are designated as fair value hedges of the mortgage loans held for sale  and both the delivery commitments and loans held for sale are recorded at fair value  with changes in fair value recorded in financial services revenue 
income taxes 
income taxes are calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance with respect to applicability to the company s operations 
no valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets because management believes the full amount of the net deferred tax asset will be realized in the future 
results of operations in conformity with sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas  the company s segment information is presented on the basis that the chief operating decision makers use in evaluating segment performance 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies included in note of the consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of  the company realigned the homebuilding operations from a single reportable homebuilding segment into a regional structure  with each region having a regional president 
the company s homebuilding regions are midwest  florida north  florida south and mid atlantic 
following the implementation of this new regional structure  the company s chief operating decision makers evaluate the company s performance in various ways  including our nine individual homebuilding operating segment s results and the results of the financial services operation  our four homebuilding regions  and consolidated financial results 
as a result of this evaluation  effective beginning the fourth quarter of we have determined our reportable segments in accordance with sfas as follows midwest homebuilding  florida homebuilding  mid atlantic homebuilding and financial services operations 
the homebuilding operating segments that are included within each reportable segment have similar operations and exhibit similar economic characteristics  and therefore meet the aggregation criteria in sfas we have also aggregated our florida north and florida south regions into a single florida homebuilding reportable segment in accordance with the aggregation criteria set forth in sfas our homebuilding operations include the acquisition and development of land  the sale and construction of single family attached and detached homes and the occasional sale of lots to third parties 
the homebuilding operating segments that comprise each of our reportable segments are as follows midwest florida mid atlantic columbus  ohio tampa  florida washington  dc cincinnati  ohio orlando  florida charlotte  north carolina indianapolis  indiana west palm beach  florida raleigh  north carolina as required by sfas  the company has restated its and segment information consistent with the current reportable segment structure 
this segment restatement has no effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flow for the periods presented 
the financial services operations include the origination and sale of mortgage loans and title and insurance agency services for purchasers of the company s homes 
eliminations consist of fees paid by the homebuilding operations relating to loan origination and title fees for its homebuyers that are included in financial services revenue  the homebuilding segment s housing costs include these fees paid to financial services 
highlights and trends for the year ended december  overview homebuilding is and has been a cyclical business 
since the adjustment period in the early s  the industry experienced years of strong results  as did our company experiencing consecutive years of record results through however  during  as has been well publicized  the homebuilding industry experienced a country wide softening of demand for new homes  which has ultimately resulted in an over supply of new and existing homes and a weakening of buyer sentiment 
in response to these conditions  some homebuilders offered significantly discounted prices in an attempt to continue to sell new homes at historical paces 
our company selectively discounted in  consistent with our philosophy to remain committed to quality over quantity and to balance our sales pace with our desire to preserve margin integrity 
although we believe long term fundamentals  which support home sales and demand  remain solid and the current negative conditions in most of our markets will moderate over time  we cannot predict the duration or severity of these conditions and to date have seen no meaningful signs of recovery 
in the meantime  we remain focused on our company s fundamentals premier locations  building a quality home and taking care of our customers  while at the same time continuing to execute a defensive operating strategy focused on strengthening our financial capabilities and positioning ourselves for the market s recovery 
specifically we have employed initiatives that emphasize our product  customer service and premier locations  improve affordability by constantly reviewing our sales prices  offering incentives and reducing costs of goods purchased from both vendors and subcontractors to maximize profits and cash flows  decrease our selling  general and administrative expense infrastructure to reflect local market business conditions  and reduce our land and lot inventory investment from current levels by significantly curtailing our land purchases  phasing and or delaying land development  and pursuing the sale of certain owned land 
we expect our operating strategy will generate positive operating cash flows in fiscal  lowering our investment levels  with a resulting reduction of approximately million in our outstanding debt 
however  because we cannot predict the duration or severity of current market conditions  we cannot provide any assurances 
key financial results for the year ended december   homes delivered decreased compared to  while the average sales price of homes delivered increased  from  to  total revenue increased million over  to approximately billion 
housing revenue increased million and revenue from the sale of land to outside parties increased million primarily as a result of lots sold to third parties in tampa  raleigh and columbus 
our financial services revenue declined million compared to the prior year due to fewer loan originations 
the decrease in loan originations was partly offset by higher loan amounts and a change in product mix 
we currently estimate homes delivered to be approximately  with region breakdown of in the midwest  in florida and in the mid atlantic region 
in addition  we currently estimate the deliveries to be approximately   and in the first  second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
income before income taxes for decreased million over  driven by the million of charges relating to the impairment of inventory and investments in unconsolidated llcs in certain of our markets 
also contributing to this decrease was an increase in general and administrative expenses of million  which was primarily due to million of separation costs related to departure of our chief operating officer in june and severance costs related to workforce reductions  primarily in the midwest  million increase in deposit write offs and other charges with respect to abandoned land transactions  our increased investment in land resulting in million higher expenses  expenses of million for equity based awards under sfas r  and an increase of million for professional and consulting fees 
selling expenses also increased by million or when compared to the year ended december  primarily due to a million increase in spending on models and sales offices due to our higher community count  million higher advertising and marketing costs relating our community count growth and promotions to stimulate sales in certain markets  an increase of million related to training and investments made in our design centers  and an increase of million relating to the inclusion in of shamrock homes selling expenses for a full year 
the above decreases impacting income before taxes were partially offset by the increase in revenue described above 
s new contracts of  were down compared to  in as a result of industry conditions described in the overview section above  all of our regions experienced reduced traffic levels  weaker demand  higher cancellation rates  an over supply of inventory and significant competitor discounting 
these current conditions resulted in an increase in our cancellation rate  which was for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in our fourth quarter cancellation rate reached an all time high of 
as a result of softened market conditions  we experienced a decrease in new contracts in our florida region and a decline in new contracts in our midwest region 
our mid atlantic region new contracts declined only due primarily to strong sales results in our charlotte market 
as mentioned above  in january  we lowered our sales prices in certain of our communities to be more competitive and believe this has led to our best sales month since march as a result of lower refinance volume for outside lenders and increased competition  during we expect to experience continued pressure on our mortgage company s capture rate  which was approximately during and during this could continue to negatively impact earnings 
we continue to focus on our investment in land 
during  we abandoned million of land and lot deposits and pre acquisition costs for transactions that we no longer intend to pursue due to market conditions 
we also have million of land held for sale at december  and are looking at additional parcels to sell to lower our investment in inventory 
our planned land purchases of million  the majority of which is in north carolina where market conditions remain solid  is less than our land purchases of million 
as discussed above  we are experiencing changes in market conditions that require us to constantly monitor the value of our inventories and investments in unconsolidated llcs in those markets in which we operate  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
during the year ended december   we recorded million of charges relating to the impairment of inventory and investment in unconsolidated llcs 
we generally believe that we will see a gradual improvement in market conditions over the long term 
during  we will continue to update our evaluation of the value of our inventories and investments for impairment  and could be required to record additional impairment charges which would negatively impact earnings should market conditions deteriorate further or results differ from management s assumptions 
our effective income tax rate for was  compared to for the reduction in rate reflects differences in the location of state taxable income  clarification of the amount of manufacturing credit available under the american jobs creation act of  and the change in the state of ohio income tax from one that is income based to one that is based on gross receipts  the recording of which is classified as general and administrative expense 
in s first quarter  we are required to adopt financial interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
we have not completed our evaluation of the impact of this interpretation  but do not expect it to have a material impact 
highlights and trends for the year ended december  homes delivered declined compared to  from  in to  in the decline in homes delivered was due to softness in our midwest markets  lower community counts going into and delays in our florida markets caused by weather  longer regulatory processes and shortages in certain materials and labor 
total revenue for increased over to billion 
housing revenue increased due to an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered  from  in to  in land revenue increased million  primarily as a result of lots sold to third parties in tampa  orlando  columbus and washington  dc during in addition  during  our homebuilding operations recognized million of revenue related to the change in home closings with low down payment loans that were not yet sold to a third party  whereas the impact to revenue for resulted in a million reduction in revenue 
our financial services revenue declined million compared to the prior year due to fewer loan originations and lower gains on the sale of loans to third parties resulting from the change in mix of loans sold 
income before income taxes for increased million and over  driven by the increase in revenue described above  partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage in compared to in  along with a increase in general and administrative expenses and a increase in interest expense 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to land related expenses associated with our growth and diversification activities  including real estate taxes  homeowner s association fees for active communities and additional personnel costs  totaling approximately million 
also in  we expensed certain deposits and costs totaling million on land transactions where the return potential had declined from the initial evaluation or certain contingencies were not satisfied 
additionally  the increase was due to the absence in of million of income relating to interest rate swaps that terminated in september partially offsetting these higher general and administrative costs was the absence in of million of expense recorded in s general and administrative expense relating to the redemption of our million senior notes 
the million increase in interest expense was the result of higher weighted average borrowings and a slightly higher weighted average interest rate  partially offset by an increase in interest capitalized due to an increase in land under development and backlog 
s new contracts of  were down compared to  in market conditions in the midwest  where our new contracts were down  along with certain weather and permitting related delays we experienced during in opening new communities  resulted in lower than anticipated new contracts 
our effective tax rate was for compared to for the reduction was primarily a result of the manufacturing credit established by the american jobs creation act 
the decrease is also due to a change in the state of ohio s tax laws  which phases out the ohio income tax and replaces it with a gross receipts tax  which is classified as general and administrative expense 
in addition  we had a favorable resolution of certain state related tax matters during year ended december  in thousands revenue midwest homebuilding florida homebuilding mid atlantic homebuilding other homebuilding unallocated a financial services intercompany eliminations total revenue operating income loss midwest homebuilding b florida homebuilding b mid atlantic homebuilding b other homebuilding unallocated a financial services less corporate selling  general and administrative expense total operating income interest expense midwest homebuilding florida homebuilding mid atlantic homebuilding financial services total interest expense total income before taxes assets midwest homebuilding florida homebuilding mid atlantic homebuilding financial services corporate total assets investment in unconsolidated llcs midwest homebuilding florida homebuilding mid atlantic homebuilding financial services total investment in unconsolidated llcs depreciation and amortization midwest homebuilding florida homebuilding mid atlantic homebuilding financial services corporate total depreciation and amortization a other homebuilding unallocated consists of the net impact in the period due to timing of homes delivered with low down payment loans buyers put less than down funded by the company s financial services operations not yet sold to a third party 
in accordance with sfas and sfas  recognition of such revenue must be deferred until the related loan is sold to a third party 
b includes the impact of charges relating to the impairment of inventory and investment in unconsolidated llcs and the write off of land deposits and pre acquisition costs 
these charges reduced operating income by million in the midwest region  million in the florida region and million in the mid atlantic region 
seasonality and variability in quarterly results we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  significant seasonality and quarter to quarter variability in homebuilding activity levels 
in general  homes delivered increase substantially in the third and fourth quarters 
we believe that this seasonality reflects the tendency of homebuyers to shop for a new home in the spring with the goal of closing in the fall or winter  as well as the scheduling of construction to accommodate seasonal weather conditions 
we also have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  seasonality in our financial services operations because loan originations correspond with the delivery of homes in our homebuilding operations

our effective tax rate was for compared to for as discussed above under highlights and trends for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources operating cash flow activities during the year ended december   we used million of cash in our operating activities  as compared to million of cash used in such activities during the net cash used in operations during was primarily the result of cash used to fund million investment in land and lots excluding million of land purchased by our unconsolidated llcs reported as investing activities  a million net increase in homes under construction including an million increase in speculative homes  and a million increase in cash held in escrow due to homes closing near the end of the year for which the cash was not collected until the beginning of partially offsetting the cash used was million of cash  resulting from net income of million and excluding non cash impairment and abandonment charges  net of tax  of million  a million decrease in mortgage loans held for sale  and a million increase in accounts payable 
the principal reason for the increase in operating cash outflows in was our decision to further invest in land to enable sales growth 
the decision to purchase land was based on management s expectations for future returns from the incremental investments 
in light of more challenging market conditions encountered in the latter half of  our expectations have changed  and we have substantially lowered our planned purchase of land and lots to reduce our inventory to better match our forecasted reduced number of home sales 
our ability to reduce inventory levels in the near term is  however  dependent on our ability to close a sufficient number of homes in the next few quarters 
to the extent our inventory levels decrease during fiscal  we expect to have net positive cash flows from operating activities in  assuming all other factors remain constant 
investing cash flow activities for the year ended december   we used million of cash through our investing activities  primarily for additional investments in certain of our unconsolidated llcs totaling million 
financing cash flow activities for the year ended december   our financing activities provided million of cash  relating to million of additional borrowing net of repayments from our revolving credit facilities  partially offset by million used for the repurchase of  of the company s common shares 
our homebuilding and financial services operations financing needs depend on anticipated sales volume in the current year as well as future years  inventory levels and related turnover  land and lot purchase plans and other company plans 
we fund these operations with cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under our bank credit facilities  which are primarily unsecured  and  from time to time  issuances of new debt and or equity securities  as management deems necessary 
as we utilize our capital resources and liquidity to fund our operations  we constantly focus on the impact on our balance sheet 
we have incurred substantial indebtedness  and may incur substantial indebtedness in the future  to fund our homebuilding activities 
during  we currently intend to purchase approximately million of land and or lots  primarily in our north carolina markets 
we believe we will be able to continue to fund our future cash needs through our cash flows from operations  our existing credit facilities and the issuance of new debt  preferred stock and or other equity securities through the public capital markets

the credit facility contains covenants that require the company  among other things  to maintain minimum net worth amounts and to maintain certain financial ratios 
currently  we believe the most restrictive covenant of the credit facility is interest coverage 
under this covenant  the company is required to maintain  on a rolling four quarter basis  interest coverage of two times earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and non cash charges as defined in the credit facility 
based on our current information  we believe we will meet this requirement through the third quarter  however  we may fall slightly below this requirement level in the fourth quarter of we monitor this and other covenant requirements closely and will pursue certain actions should this situation appear probable as we move through the year

for the years ended december   and  our weighted average borrowings outstanding were million  million and million  respectively  with a weighted average interest rate of  and  respectively 
the increase in borrowings was the result of our higher investment in land  land development and speculative homes inventory 
the increase in the weighted average interest rate was due to the addition of our fixed rate senior notes in  and the overall market increase in interest rates  which has impacted our variable rate borrowings

c the company is party to a land purchase option agreement to acquire developed lots from a seller who is a variable interest entity 
the company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity  and therefore is required under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation r  consolidation of variable interest entities to consolidate the entity 
as of december   the company has recorded a liability of million relating to consolidation of this variable interest entity 
the actual cash payments that the company will make in the future will be based upon the number of lots acquired each period and the related per lot prices in effect at that time 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this obligation 
d the amount reported herein of million represents principal and interest for a bond obligation incurred in connection with the acquisition of lots in a community in florida 
this obligation will be repaid as the company closes on the lots in this community to third parties and the estimated payments by period above have been estimated based on the expected timing of closings 
in addition  in connection with the development of certain of the company s communities  local government entities have been established and bonds have been issued by those entities to finance a portion of the related infrastructure 
these community development district obligations represent obligations of the company as the current holder of the property  net of cash held by the district available to offset the particular bond obligations 
as of december   the company has recorded a liability of million relating to these community development district obligations 
however  the actual cash payments that the company will ultimately make will be dependent upon the timing of the sale of those lots within the district to third parties and we are unable to estimate the timing  therefore  the amounts have not been included above 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these obligations 
e the company has obligations with certain subcontractors and suppliers of raw materials in the ordinary course of business to meet the commitment to deliver  homes with an aggregate sales price of million 
based on our current housing gross margin of  exclusive of impairment charges  plus variable selling costs of of revenue  less costs already incurred on homes in backlog  we estimate payments totaling approximately million to be made in relating to those homes 
f the company has options and contingent purchase agreements to acquire land and developed lots with an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
purchase of properties is generally contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements by the company and the sellers and therefore the timing of payments under these agreements is not determinable 
the company has no specific performance obligations with respect to these agreements 
off balance sheet arrangements our primary use of off balance sheet arrangements is for the purpose of securing the most desirable lots on which to build homes for our homebuyers in a manner that we believe reduces the overall risk to the company 
our off balance sheet arrangements relating to our homebuilding operations include unconsolidated llcs  land option agreements  guarantees and indemnifications associated with acquiring and developing land and the issuance of letters of credit and completion bonds 
additionally  in the ordinary course of business  our financial services operations issue guarantees and indemnities relating to the sale of loans to third parties 
unconsolidated limited liability companies 
in the ordinary course of business  the company periodically enters into arrangements with third parties to acquire land and develop lots 
these arrangements include the creation by the company of llcs  with the company s interest in these entities ranging from to 
these entities engage in land development activities for the purpose of distributing in the form of a capital distribution or selling developed lots to the company and its partners in the entity 
these entities generally do not meet the criteria of variable interest entities vies  because the equity at risk is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support from the equity investors  however  we must evaluate each entity to determine whether it is or is not a vie 
if an entity were determined to be a vie  we also evaluate whether or not we are the primary beneficiary 
these evaluations are initially performed when each new entity is created and upon any events that require reconsideration of the entity 
we have determined that none of the llcs in which we have an interest are vies  and we also have determined that we do not have substantive control over any of these entities  therefore  our homebuilding llcs are recorded using the equity method of accounting 
the company believes its maximum exposure related to any of these entities as of december  to be the amount invested of million plus our million share of letters of credit totaling million that serve as completion bonds for the development work in progress  and our obligations under guarantees and indemnifications provided in connection with these entities as further discussed in note and note of our consolidated financial statements 
during  we may enter into additional arrangements to create llcs in order to increase our homebuilding activities while sharing the risk with our partner in each respective entity 
land option agreements 
in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into land option agreements in order to secure land for the construction of homes in the future 
pursuant to these land option agreements  the company will provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future  usually at predetermined prices 
because the entities holding the land under option often meet the criteria for vies  the company evaluates all land option agreements to determine if it is necessary to consolidate any of these entities 
the company currently believes that its maximum exposure as of december  related to these agreements is equal to the amount of the company s outstanding deposits  which totaled million  including cash deposits of million  letters of credit of million and corporate promissory notes of million 
further details relating to our land option agreements are included in note of our consolidated financial statements 
letters of credit and completion bonds 
the company provides standby letters of credit and completion bonds for development work in progress  deposits on land and lot purchase agreements and miscellaneous deposits 
as of december   the company has outstanding approximately million of completion bonds and standby letters of credit  including those related to llcs and land option agreements discussed above 
guarantees and indemnities 
in the ordinary course of business  m i financial enters into agreements that guarantee purchasers of its mortgage loans that m i financial will repurchase a loan if certain conditions occur 
m i financial has also provided indemnifications to certain third party investors and insurers in lieu of repurchasing certain loans 
the risk associated with the guarantees and indemnities above is offset by the value of the underlying assets  and the company accrues its best estimate of the probable loss on these loans 
additionally  the company has provided certain other guarantees and indemnities in connection with the acquisition and development of land by our homebuilding operations 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for additional details relating to our guarantees and indemnities 
interest rates and inflation our business is significantly affected by general economic conditions of the united states of america and  particularly  by the impact of interest rates 
higher interest rates may decrease our potential market by making it more difficult for homebuyers to qualify for mortgages or to obtain mortgages at interest rates that are acceptable to them 
the impact of increased rates can be offset  in part  by offering variable rate loans with lower interest rates 
in conjunction with our mortgage financing services  hedging methods are used to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations between the commitment date of the loan and the time the loan closes 
in recent years  we have not experienced any detrimental effect from inflation 
when we develop lots for our own use  inflation may increase our profits because land costs are fixed well in advance of sales efforts 
we are generally able to maintain costs with subcontractors from the date construction is started on a home through the delivery date 
however  in certain situations  unanticipated costs may occur between the time of start and the delivery date  resulting in lower gross profit margins 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk through the borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities  consisting of the credit facility and the mif credit facility  which permit borrowings of up to million as of december  including the temporary million increase in the mif credit facility for the period december  through january   subject to availability constraints
