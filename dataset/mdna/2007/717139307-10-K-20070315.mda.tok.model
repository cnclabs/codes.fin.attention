item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections of future events 
such statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to unknown risks  uncertainty and other factors that may cause results to differ materially from those contemplated in such forward looking statements 
in addition  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
executive summary the results for the year ended december  and were a net loss of million and million or a loss per share of and  respectively 
the operating expenses for were million  primarily comprised of million for in process acquired research and development relating to the vela acquisition  ongoing research and development expenses for million and general and administration expenses of million 
the year was one of strategic repositioning of the company 
the company sought to acquire later stage clinical assets and this was accomplished by the acquisition of vela pharmaceuticals which closed on october  in connection with this  the company expensed million for in process research and development costs 
research and development efforts in were conducted out of the company s rehovot facility in israel 
the most significant development efforts were the completion of a phase i trial and the conduct of two proof of principal phase iia trials for its lead candidate for treating pain  cannabinor 
the company also completed a phase trial for its nanoemulsion delivery technology 
during the year the general and administrative expenses were higher than normal due to legal and accounting work related to the acquisition of vela along with the costs associated with a shareholder proxy contest 
in the company received a payment from bausch and lomb of million which significantly reduced the loss for that year 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the listing below is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to stock based compensation  tax valuation allowance and asset impairments to be critical policies due to the estimation process involved in each 
equity based compensation effective january   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which establishes the financial accounting and reporting standards for stock based compensation plans 
sfas r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options and restricted stock units  and employee stock purchases related to the espp 
under the provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period of the entire award generally the vesting period of the award 
the company has elected to expense these awards on a straight line basis over the life of the awards 
as a result of adopting sfas r  the company s net loss before income taxes and net loss for the year ended december  was  more than if the company had continued to account for stock based compensation under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and its related interpretations 
basic and diluted net loss per share for the year ended december  of is more as a result of adopting sfas r 
the company elected to use the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas r and  therefore  financial results for prior periods have not been restated 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  includes expense for all equity awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
since the adoption of sfas r  there have been no changes to the company s stock compensation plans or modifications to outstanding stock based awards which would increase the value of any awards outstanding other than the acceleration and full vesting of options held by two senior executives who left the company and two board members who left the board 
the financial impact of these modifications has been reflected in our results 
compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted subsequent to january  was based on the grant date fair value determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
during the year ended december   the company recognized compensation expense of  for stock options which was recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   the total compensation costs related to non vested awards not yet recognized is million which will be recognized over the next three and one half years 
prior to january   the company accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with apb and also followed the disclosure requirements of sfas under apb  the company accounted for stock based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method as allowed under sfas the following table illustrates the effect on net loss and loss per share if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
to stock based employee compensation 
the estimated fair value of each option is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
year ended december  year ended december  net loss as reported add stock based employee compensation expense included in reported net loss deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards pro forma net loss loss per share basic and diluted  as reported basic and diluted  pro forma for disclosure purposes under sfas no 
 the fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model with the following weighted average assumption risk free interest rate expected lives in years dividend yield expected volatility on june   the company accelerated the vesting of unvested stock options awarded under its stock option plans that had exercise prices greater than  the closing price was on june  unvested options to purchase approximately  shares became exercisable as a result of the vesting acceleration 
typically  the company grants stock options that vest over a four year period 
the purpose of the accelerated vesting was to enable the company to avoid recognizing  in its consolidated statement of operations  compensation expense associated with these options in future periods  upon adoption of sfas r share based payment in january the impact of this acceleration resulted in a million increase in proforma stock based compensation expense in options issued to non employees other than directors are accounted for under the fair value method in accordance with sfas and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services 
under the fair value method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date of the option based on the value of the award using the black scholes method 
compensation cost is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest in accordance with eitf issue no 
and is recognized over the service period 
on september   the board of directors approved the retention award agreements and pharmos entered into retention award agreements with each of dr 
haim aviv  chairman and chief executive officer  and dr 
gad riesenfeld  its then president and chief operating officer 
the company granted retention awards consisting of cash and restricted stock units to dr 
aviv 
the company granted retention awards consisting of cash and restricted stock to dr 
riesenfeld the awards 
under the agreement  one half of the awards vested on december  and the balance shall vest and become non forfeitable on june   subject to certain accelerated vesting provisions 
under the terms of dr 
riesenfeld s severance agreement  the balance of his awards vested on his departure from the company on april  and the expense of those awards was accelerated through april  the fair value of the restricted shares was based on the fair value of the stock on the issuance date 
the aggregate fair value of the restricted stock awards totaled million 
for financial reporting purposes  the cash awards and the fair value of the restricted stock awards  which totaled  will be expensed pro rata over the vesting periods 
per the awards  only dr 
riesenfeld was issued the restricted stock  dr 
aviv received restricted stock units 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flow to the recorded value of the asset 
subsequent impairment assessments could result in future impairment charges 
any impairment charge would result in the reduction in the carrying value of long lived assets and would increase our net loss in the period in which the charge arose 
tax valuation allowance the company has assessed the likelihood of realizing future taxable income and has determined that a deferred tax valuation allowance is deemed necessary 
in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income or decrease the loss in the period such determination is made
