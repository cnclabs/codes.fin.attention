executive overview the equity and equity derivative trading business is continuing to experience significant change 
in december and january  the nyse  amex and other auction based exchanges implemented new trading systems in which the markets have become almost completely electronic 
these initiatives were undertaken in order to comply with regulation nms  expected to be effective in march in addition  decimalization  sector and index trading strategies and a decline in block trading have led to increased program trading and a decline in average order size on the nyse and other exchanges  which reduces our ability to participate in certain trades 
the nyse s new hybrid market model has had the most significant impact on our role as a specialist 
the hybrid model is expected to allow specialists to interact in a fast and more automated market 
most of the trades which had been executed by us as agent are now being matched electronically  and we are now inserting our capital and adding liquidity to the market electronically  rather than manually  except in certain break out situations 
although these changes affect the way in which stocks are traded  many elements of the central auction market are preserved 
even with the completed nyse archipelago merger  the hybrid model and sec s regulation nms initiatives  senior nyse officials have publicly stated that there will continue to be an auction market with a central point of sale 
they have also stated that specialists will continue to play an integral role in providing liquidity and will continue to have an affirmative obligation to make a fair and orderly market 
a specialist s primary role is to provide liquidity by committing capital when market imbalances occur  and we believe that technology cannot eliminate these market imbalances 
accordingly  we anticipate that specialists will continue to play an important role in stock trading but will do so in a more electronic environment 
we are committed to providing liquidity and improving market quality 
even though our participation rate initially has declined from pre hybrid levels  we believe the trading tools we are developing may result in higher participation rates over time along with opportunities to increase revenues 
testing on our new advanced hybrid technology on a pilot basis indicates that our participation rates can increase 
the new technology  which we have been developing for the past three years  is being deployed in stages with the goal of meaningful implementation in we expect to adjust these technologies on an ongoing basis  and anticipate that they will enable us to increase the liquidity of our markets 
the financial results of our specialist and market making business are highly dependent on trading volumes and volatility 
as volumes grow  we believe market volatility will return as well  which will enable us to participate as principal in more transactions in our specialist and market making operations 
we have significantly cut costs throughout our organization through the reduction of legal  professional and exchange fees  the mitigation of compensation costs through restructuring and automation 
we have reduced the legacy costs of operating a manual market by reducing our headcount by employees during the fourth quarter of and january we also are examining our opportunities relating to the retirement of outstanding debt with the goal of reducing our fixed charge interest expense 
one of the other things on which we are focusing is our ability to quote electronically in different marketplaces simultaneously so that we are able to get our quotes and disseminate our interest in different marketplaces 
structured products such as etfs continue to grow in popularity 
etfs which have some characteristics similar to sector and index funds trade continually throughout the day on an exchange 
the liquidity and flexibility of being exchange traded has led to substantial growth in these products 
etf assets grew to approximately billion as of january  from billion as of december  we believe that the growth in these products will continue as investors seek to lower investment costs  manage tax liability and hedge portfolio risks 
it is our intention to continue to work with etf issuers as they launch new products and to provide added liquidity in etf trading 
we also believe the trading of options  indexes and other products will follow the pattern of cash equities 
the products that require little price discovery and negotiation will default to an electronic matching facility while the more complex and illiquid products will continue to rely on specialists and lead market makers to effect trades 
we expect the first tranche of our million nyx shares to become unrestricted on march  this event will increase the assets constituting regulatory capital in our nyse specialist and execution and clearing businesses 
the combined liquidity adjustments from the nla reduction and elimination of the restrictions on our nyx shares will result in approximately million of additional free cash over the first two quarters of before our debt servicing payments  based on the closing market price per share of nyx stock on february  our free cash at december  was approximately million 
new accounting developments employee incentive plans we adopted the fair value recognition provisions for share based awards pursuant to sfas no 
r effective january  please refer to footnote  employee incentive plans of our consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information and disclosure 
accounting for tax uncertainties in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on de recognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin will be effective beginning in the first quarter of we have evaluated the potential impact of fin  and at this time  we believe that our contingent tax reserve and current and deferred income taxes are adequately stated in conformity with fas and fin fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements  but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value 
sfas nullifies the guidance in eitf which precluded the recognition of a trading profit at the inception of a derivative contract  unless the fair value of such derivative is obtained from a quoted market price  or other valuation technique incorporating observable market data 
sfas also precludes the use of a liquidity or block discount  when measuring instruments traded in an active market at fair value 
sfas requires that costs related to acquiring financial instruments carried at fair value should not be capitalized  but rather should be expensed as incurred 
sfas also clarifies that an issuer s credit standing should be considered when measuring liabilities at fair value 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   with earlier application permitted and encouraged 
sfas must be applied prospectively  except that the provisions related to block discounts and the guidance in eitf are to be applied as a one time cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the first interim period for the fiscal year in which sfas is initially applied 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities employers sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
we currently report the majority of our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in compliance with industry guidelines for brokers and dealers in securities 
we have a significant investment in intangibles and goodwill as well as public debt which is not accounted for at fair value 
we believe sfas exempts intangible assets and goodwill from fair value reporting 
we currently are evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of sfas will have on our financial statements 
critical accounting estimates goodwill and other intangible assets we determine the fair value of each of our reporting units and the fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in determining fair value  we use standard analytical approaches to business enterprise valuation bev  such as the market comparable approach and the income approach 
the market comparable approach is based on comparisons of the subject company to similar companies engaged in an actual merger or acquisition or to public companies whose stocks are actively traded 
as part of this process  multiples of value relative to financial variables  such as earnings or stockholders equity  are developed and applied to the appropriate financial variables of the subject company to indicate its value 
the income approach involves estimating the present value of the subject company s future cash flows by using projections of the cash flows that the business is expected to generate  and discounting these cash flows at a given rate of return 
each of these bev methodologies requires the use of management estimates and assumptions 
for example  under the market comparable approach  we assigned a certain control premium to the public market price of our common stock as of the valuation date of our year end impairment test  in estimating the fair value of our specialist reporting unit 
similarly  under the income approach  we assumed certain growth rates for our revenues  expenses  earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  returns on working capital  returns on other assets and capital expenditures  among others 
we also assumed certain discount rates and certain terminal growth rates in our calculations 
for our year end goodwill impairment tests  we engaged an independent business valuation firm to assist us in our bev analyses 
given the subjectivity involved in selecting which bev approach to use and in determining the input variables for use in our analyses  it is possible that a different valuation model and the selection of different input variables could produce a materially different estimate of the fair value of our goodwill 
we review the reasonableness of the carrying value of our goodwill on an annual calendar basis ie  december unless an event or change in circumstances requires an interim reassessment of impairment 
during  there were no interim changes in circumstances that necessitated goodwill impairment testing prior to our annual required testing of goodwill 
as a result of our analysis of the above mentioned factors for the year ended december   with the assistance of the independent business valuation firm  we determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill under sfas no 
we cannot provide assurance that future goodwill impairment testing will not result in impairment charges in subsequent periods 
another of our intangible assets  as defined under sfas no 
 is our trade name 
we determine the fair value of our trade name by applying the income approach using the royalty savings methodology 
this method assumes that the trade name has value to the extent we are relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from it 
application of this methodology requires estimating an appropriate royalty rate  which is typically expressed as a percentage of revenue 
estimating an appropriate royalty rate includes reviewing evidence from comparable licensing agreements and considering qualitative factors affecting the trade name 
given the subjectivity involved in selecting which bev approach to use and in determining the input variables for use in our analyses  it is possible that a different valuation model and the selection of different input variables could produce a materially different estimate of fair value of our trade name 
we review the reasonableness of the carrying amount of our trade name on an annual basis in conjunction with our goodwill impairment assessment 
as of december   no impairment of our trade name existed 
we cannot provide assurance that future trade name impairment testing will not result in impairment charges in subsequent periods 
we amortize our identifiable intangible stock listing rights over their estimated useful lives in accordance with sfas no 
 and test for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset or asset group s carrying value may not be fully recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
an impairment loss  calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset or asset group  is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value 
as a result of our testing and analysis for the year ended december   with the assistance of an independent business valuation firm  we determined that there was no impairment of our stock listing rights under sfas no 
we cannot provide assurance that future stock listing rights impairment testing will not result in impairment charges in subsequent periods  particularly until the effects of the nyse s hybrid model can be more adequately assessed 
a prolonged period of weakness in equity markets and the trading of securities on the nyse and amex could adversely impact our businesses and impair the value of our goodwill and or identifiable intangible assets 
in addition  certain events could indicate a potential impairment of our identifiable intangible assets  including changes in market structure that could adversely affect our specialist businesses  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  or prolonged systemic failure of our self developed specialist trading system 
non marketable securities the use of fair value to measure certain non marketable investments is a critical accounting estimate 
investments in non marketable securities consist of investments in equity securities of private companies  limited liability company interests and limited partnership interests  which do not have readily available price quotations 
certain investments in non marketable securities are initially carried at cost  as an approximation of fair value 
adjustments to carrying value are made if there are third party transactions evidencing a change in value 
for certain other investments in non marketable securities  we adjust their carrying value by applying the equity method of accounting  and for our investment in a limited partnership interest  we adjust its carrying value by recognizing our share of the partnership s quarterly results of operations 
in addition  if and when available  management considers other relevant factors relating to non marketable investments in estimating their fair value  such as the financial performance of the entity  its cash flow forecasts  trends within that entity s industry and any specific rights associated with our investment such as conversion features among others 
we account for our investment in the nyx stock at the estimated fair value of such restricted shares pursuant to the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa audit and accounting guide brokers and dealers in securities 
given management s judgment involved in valuing certain of our non marketable securities  it is possible  as of a given point in time  that a third party could reach a different conclusion of fair value utilizing the same variables as we have in our analysis 
non marketable investments are tested for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset s carrying value may be impaired 
other than temporary impairment of exchange memberships the determination of the fair value of our exchange memberships is a critical accounting estimate 
exchange memberships owned by us are originally carried at cost  pursuant to the aicpa audit and accounting guide brokers and dealers in securities 
adjustments to carrying value are made if we deem that an other than temporary decline in value  as defined in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  and in section m of topic of the sec staff accounting bulletin series sab no 
 has occurred 
in determining whether the value of our owned exchange memberships is impaired ie  fair market value is below cost and whether such impairment is temporary or other than temporary  we consider many factors  including  but not limited to  information regarding recent sale and lease prices of exchange memberships  historical trends of sale and lease prices of memberships on a particular exchange and their duration  the current condition of the particular exchange s market structure  legal and regulatory developments affecting the particular exchange s market structure and earnings capability  trends in new listings on the particular exchange  general global and national economic factors and our knowledge and judgment of the specialist and execution and clearing industries and the securities market as a whole 
as a result of our analysis of the above mentioned factors for the year ended december   we believe the carrying values of our owned exchange memberships were not impaired 
we cannot provide assurance that the consistent application of this accounting policy to future reporting periods will not result in further adjustments to the carrying value of any of our remaining exchange memberships following the consummation of the nyse merger with archipelago 
this accounting policy  however  will no longer be applied in future periods to our nyse specialist operations because our nyse memberships were surrendered in connection with the nyse archipelago merger and our nyse specialist operations and clearing operations will be conducted through trading licenses 
use of estimates the use of generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates 
in addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  the use of estimates is also important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from litigation  regulatory proceedings and tax audits 
we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation  regulatory proceedings and tax audits to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different 
our total liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case by case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering  among other factors  the progress of each case or proceeding  our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings  and the opinions and views of legal counsel 
given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of our litigation and regulatory matters  particularly in cases or proceedings in which substantial or indeterminate damages or fines are sought  we cannot estimate losses or ranges of losses for cases or proceedings where there is only a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred 
see legal proceedings in part i  item of this annual report on form k for information on our judicial  regulatory and arbitration proceedings 
execution and clearing risk our execution and clearing segment  through the normal course of business  enters into various securities transactions as agent 
the execution  settlement and financing of these transactions can result in unrecorded market risk and concentration of credit risk 
our execution and clearing activities involve settlement and financing of various customer securities transactions on a cash or margin basis 
these activities may expose us to risk in the event the customer or other broker is unable to fulfill its contractual obligations and we have to purchase or sell securities at a loss 
for margin transactions  we may be exposed to significant market risk in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur in their accounts 
restructuring transactions in the fourth quarter of and january  we implemented a restructuring plan which has resulted in a significant headcount reduction and future reduction in compensation costs 
due primarily to the automation of securities markets such as the nyse s hybrid market  we reduced our headcount by positions because we need fewer people to execute trades on the floors of the exchanges on which we conduct business 
as a result of this restructuring  we incurred additional compensation expense of approximately million in connection with severance and supplemental unemployment compensation 
we expect our compensation expense and related benefits to decline by up to million in as a result of this restructuring 
as of january   we converted our labranche financial services  inc lfsi subsidiary into a limited liability company by way of a merger of lfsi with and into a newly formed limited liability company  which succeeded to all the rights  obligations and liabilities of lfsi 
subsequently  on january   the new entity changed its name to labranche financial services  llc 
labranche co inc is the sole owner of labranche financial services  llc  which is referred to in this annual report as lfs 
completed senior note repurchase on august   we sold our investment in lava trading inc lava as part of the acquisition of lava by citigroup financial products  inc upon the closing of the lava acquisition  which constituted an asset sale under the terms of the indenture  we received million in cash 
under the lava acquisition agreement  additional consideration of approximately million was being held in escrow to secure our indemnification obligations as a stockholder of lava 
the full amount of this escrow was released to us on october  an additional  was received by us on or before october  in connection with the settlement by lava of tax and insurance claims 
under the terms of the indenture governing our outstanding senior notes due and our outstanding senior notes due collectively  the outstanding senior notes  by the st day following the receipt of these proceeds  we were required to offer to purchase outstanding senior notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to the after tax amount of these proceeds to the extent we had not used any portion of such net cash proceeds to repay any of our secured indebtedness or any indebtedness of our subsidiaries or to acquire replacement assets 
therefore  on october   we commenced an offer to purchase outstanding senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of up to million 
this excess proceeds offer expired on november   with  principal amount of outstanding senior notes having been tendered 
following the closing of this transaction and the closings of other previous offers to repurchase with immaterial tenders of senior notes  approximately million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due remained outstanding and approximately million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due remained outstanding

interest revenue generated by our specialist and market making segment consists primarily of interest earned in securities lending transactions and inventory financing in connection with our trading in options  futures and etfs 
revenues  net of interest expense  at our specialist and market making segment is calculated after netting revenues by the interest expense related to those operations and the interest expense related to our public debt 
the interest expense related to our specialist and market making segment is primarily the result of inventory financing costs relating to positions taken in connection with our options  futures and etfs specialist and market making operations and interest on subordinated indebtedness that has been approved by the nyse for inclusion in the net capital of our labranche co 
llc subsidiary 
key metrics of our specialist and market making activities when assessing the performance and financial results of a specific period  management examines certain metrics to ascertain their impact on cash equity specialist financial results 
some of the key metrics that we review  and their values for  and  are as follows vs 
percentage change vs 
percentage change nyse average daily share volume in millions lab share volume on the nyse in billions lab dollar value on the nyse in billions share volume of principal shares traded in billions dollar value of principal shares traded in billions average closing price of the cboe volatility index program trading as a percentage of nyse average daily share volume number of specialist etfs number of specialist options generally  an increase in the average daily share volume on the nyse  an increase in volatility as measured by the average closing price of the cboe s volatility index  or the vix  an increase in the dollar value and share volume of our principal shares or a decrease in program trading enables us to increase our level of principal participation and thus our ability to realize net gain on principal transactions 
while we monitor these metrics each period  they are not the sole indicators or factors in any given period that determine our level of revenues  profitability or overall performance 
other factors  such as extreme price movements  unanticipated company news and events and other uncertainties may influence our financial performance either positively or negatively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the decline in net gain on principal transactions in our specialist and market making segment was attributable primarily to our cash equity specialist operations 
the decrease was due to a decline in principal shares traded  as well as market volatility  as measured by the average closing price of the vix  which was unchanged year over year 
other factors that reduced our opportunity to participate was the continuing rise in program trading as a percentage of nyse average daily share volume and decreases in nyse average daily share volume and dollar value of principal shares traded of stocks for which we are the equity specialist 
the increase in stock borrow interest revenue generated by our specialist and market making segment consists primarily of interest earned in securities lending transactions and inventory financing in connection with our trading in options  futures and etfs 
other interest revenues increased due to the higher average interest rate yields earned on our investment of excess cash 
interest expense in our specialist and market making segment increased primarily as a result of increased inventory financing costs relating to the growth and expansion of trading activity in our options  futures and etfs specialist and market making operations 
inventory financing costs increased from million in to million in while interest expense increased to of total segment revenues in from in  stock borrow interest income increased to of total segment revenues in from for both stock borrow rebate and margin interest expense should be considered as components in the overall computation of net trading revenue in the specialist and market making segment 
our specialist and market making segment realized a million gain from the exchange of nyse memberships in the nyse archipelago merger another three memberships were held by our execution and clearing segment 
we valued the million shares of nyx stock received in exchange for those nyse memberships at fair value  which was deemed to be the value of the shares on the first day of trading of nyx stock  or per share  minus a valuation allowance due to the restrictions on transfer applicable to the shares 
since the consummation of the nyse archipelago merger  we account for the investment in the nyx stock held by our specialist and market making segment at market value minus the valuation discount attributable to the transfer restrictions at december   the discount was 
at december   the nyse closing market price for the nyx stock was per share as compared to per share at the date of the nyse archipelago merger 
thus  the aggregate gain  both realized and unrealized  in our specialist and market making segment with respect to the nyse archipelago merger for was million  including the dividend of million we received in connection with our nyse memberships prior to the nyse archipelago merger 
for a discussion of operating expenses see our operating expenses below 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the increase in net gain on principal transactions is attributable primarily to our options  futures and etfs specialist operations  with respect to which trading revenue increased by approximately from to this revenue growth was the result of an increase in the number of products traded  market maker professionals and exchanges on which we trade our derivative products 
this was offset by a continued decrease in our cash equity specialist operations  in which trading revenue decreased by approximately from to this decrease was at a lower rate than in  but was similarly due to a decline in principal shares traded as well as the continued decline in market volatility  as measured by the average closing price of the vix 
another factor that reduced the opportunity for our cash equity specialists to participate was the continuing rise in program trading as a percentage of nyse average daily share volume 
program trading involves reducing large share orders into many smaller orders  resulting in the orders being matched electronically 
these factors offset the benefit from the increases in nyse average daily share volume and share volume and dollar value traded for equity securities in which we are the specialist 
we believe that market volatility declined as the level of mutual funds participation in the market declined 
interest revenue earned by our specialist and market making segment was higher primarily due to an increase in securities lending transactions  resulting from increased trading activity in our options  futures and etfs specialist and market making operations 
other revenue earned by our specialist and market making segment was lower primarily due to decreased proprietary trading gains 
interest expense in our specialist and market making segment increased primarily as a result of increased inventory financing costs relating to the growth and expansion of trading activity in our options  futures and etfs specialist and market making operations

the impairment charge  which represented the excess of the carrying value of our specialist and market making segment s goodwill over its implied fair value  was necessary to properly reflect the carrying value of our goodwill at september  we updated our third quarter goodwill valuation results at december   per the annual testing requirement  and noted no further impairment of this asset at that date

our operating expenses included a million charge in connection with the repurchase of a substantial portion of our then outstanding senior notes and senior subordinated notes 
this charge was attributable to a consent payment  which was offered to debt holders who tendered their notes and notes by april   and a premium for tendering the notes and notes for purchase prior to their maturity

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had  million in assets  of which million consisted of cash and short term investments  primarily in government obligations maturing within three months  cash and securities segregated under federal regulations and overnight repurchase agreements 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily with retained earnings from operations and proceeds from our debt and equity offerings 
due to the nature of the securities business and our role as a specialist  market maker and execution agent  the amount of our cash and short term investments  as well as operating cash flow  may vary considerably due to a number of factors  including the dollar value of our positions as principal  whether we are net buyers or sellers of securities  the dollar volume of executions by our customers and clearing house requirements  among others 
certain regulatory requirements constrain the use of a portion of our liquid assets for financing  investing or operating activities 
similarly  the nature of our business lines  the capital necessary to maintain current operations and our current funding needs subject our cash and cash equivalents to different requirements and uses 
as of december   the scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations  without taking into account any available roll over provisions  were as follows total year years years years s omitted short term and long term debt subordinated liabilities operating lease obligations total amounts represent aggregate amount to be paid at maturity and do not include discounts of approximately million as of december  the above table includes indebtedness with primarily long term maturities  the interest and principal payments of which have a significant effect on the cash available to finance our current and future operations 
as of december   our most significant long term indebtedness was the million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes that mature in may  and the million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes that mature in may at december   our net cash capital position was million 
fluctuations in net cash capital are common and are a function of variability in our total assets  balance sheet composition and total capital 
we attempt to maintain cash capital sources in excess of our aggregate longer term funding requirements ie  positive net cash capital 
over the previous months  our net cash capital has averaged above million 
millions cash capital available stockholders equity subordinated debt long term debt year other holding company liabilities total cash capital available cash capital required regulatory capital working capital illiquid assets long term investments subsidiary intercompany total cash capital required net cash capital cash capital available is mainly comprised of stockholders equity  long term debt  subordinated debt and other liabilities of our parent holding company which  in the aggregate  constitute the currency used to purchase our assets and provide our working capital 
this amount will principally be affected as debt matures or is refinanced and as earnings are retained or paid as dividends 
cash capital required mainly consists of the assets used in our businesses 
regulatory capital is defined as capital required by the sec and applicable exchanges to be maintained by broker dealers 
it is principally comprised of cash  net equities  other investments and net receivables from other broker dealers 
working capital constitutes liquid assets provided to our subsidiaries in excess of the required regulatory capital 
illiquid assets and long term investments are mainly comprised of exchange memberships  intangible assets  such as goodwill  tradename and stock listing rights  deposits  deferred taxes and non marketable investments 
net cash capital is considered to be the excess of cash capital available over cash capital required  or free cash  which we can utilize to fund our business needs 
we also monitor alternative funding measures in addition to our available net cash 
the alternative funding measures are significant transactions and actions we could take in a short term time frame to generate cash to meet debt maturities or other business needs 
more precisely  as of december   we have identified the following alternative funding measures to support future debt maturity requirements liquidation of net invested capital at certain subsidiaries 
reduction of excess capital at labranche co 
llc to only required net liquid assets excess nla dividend further reduction of nla requirements by the nyse and sec 
our restricted nyx shares  as previously discussed  can be either sold or held as good capital as their restrictions are removed 
if the shares are held as good capital  no tax charge is applied and cash can be freed from its current use as nla capital 
alternative funding measures millions net cash capital investment in subsidiaries further reduction of nla requirements nyx group stock total cash available from alternate funding measures computed on an after tax basis based on nyx price of per share on december  in addition to the alternative funding measures above  we monitor the maturity profile of our unsecured debt to minimize refinancing risk and we maintain relationships with debt investors and bank creditors 
strong relationships with a diverse base of creditors and debt investors are critical to our liquidity 
we also maintain available sources of short term funding that exceed actual utilization  thus allowing us to accommodate changes in investor appetite and credit capacity for our debt obligations 
with respect to the management of refinancing risk  the maturity profile of our long term debt portfolio is monitored on an ongoing basis and structured within the context of two significant debt tranches with a significant spread of years between maturities mid term and long term 
thus  we have strategically negotiated debt terms maturing in and for the significant debt tranches 
in addition  the debt tranches have call provisions which allow pre maturity retirements as early as the debt tranches have available maturities and calls over the six year period through to allow us maximum flexibility in satisfying the debt maturities with payments and or sufficient time to refinance the long term debt as required 
the following chart profiles our long term debt maturity schedule as of december  logo our outstanding senior notes were issued pursuant to an indenture which includes certain covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to make certain investments  engage in transactions with stockholders and affiliates  create liens on our assets and sell assets or engage in mergers and consolidations  except in accordance with certain specified conditions 
in addition  our ability to make so called restricted payments  such as incurring additional indebtedness other than certain permitted indebtedness  paying dividends  redeeming stock or repurchasing subordinated indebtedness prior to maturity  is limited if our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio is at or below a threshold of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio reflects a comparison between our consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization expenses  or ebitda  and the sum of our consolidated interest expense and a tax effected multiple of any dividend payments with respect to our preferred stock 
as of december   our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined  was  which means we currently cannot make any restricted payments  other than repurchasing our outstanding senior notes and any restricted payments up to an aggregate of million over the life of the indenture 
even though our fixed charge coverage ratio is below  we are still in compliance with all our covenants under the indenture 
in addition  under the indenture governing our outstanding senior notes  if  at any time  our cumulative restricted payments since may  generally are greater than i the sum of a of our cumulative consolidated net income  as defined in the indenture  since july  or  if such calculation is a loss  minus of such loss and b of the net cash proceeds received from any issuance or sale of our capital stock since july   plus ii million  we will not be entitled to make a restricted payment at such time 
as of december   our cumulative consolidated net income since july  was million  and we had received approximately million upon the exercise of options since july  as explained above  however  our fixed charge coverage ratio currently is below and accordingly  we are unable to make restricted payments greater than the million basket described above 
while we have not made any restricted payments since may   we cannot be sure if  when or to what extent this covenant will prevent or limit us from making restricted payments in the future 
the indenture governing our outstanding senior notes permits us to redeem some or all of the senior notes due on or after may  and some or all of the senior notes due on or after may  at varying redemption prices  depending on the date of redemption 
in addition  we have the option to redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes due at a redemption price of and up to of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes due at a redemption price of using the proceeds of certain equity offerings which we may complete on or prior to may  under the terms of the indenture  if we sell substantially all our assets or experience specific kinds of changes in control  we will be required to offer to repurchase outstanding senior notes  on a pro rata basis  at a price in cash equal to of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of purchase 
to the extent we repurchase any outstanding senior notes in connection with future corporate strategic initiatives  our fixed term interest payments would be correspondingly reduced 
the remaining million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due that we did not repurchase in connection with our may debt refinancing will continue to accrue interest at a rate of per annum until they mature on march  we intend on repaying the full amount of principal and interest on these notes at maturity 
as of december   the subordinated indebtedness of labranche co 
llc aggregated million 
this subordinated debt is comprised of senior subordinated notes and junior subordinated notes  which mature on various dates between february and june and bear interest at annual rates ranging from to 
the senior subordinated notes were originally issued in the aggregate principal amount of million  and  in accordance with their terms  million in principal amount must be repaid on june of each of    and labranche co 
llc repaid million in accordance with these terms in each of june  and labranche co

upon the occurrence of a change of control  labranche co 
llc may  but is not required to  make one irrevocable separate offer to each holder of the senior subordinated notes to prepay all the senior subordinated notes then held by that holder 
the occurrence of a change of control also constitutes an event of acceleration under the senior subordinated notes 
our outstanding junior subordinated notes in the aggregate principal amount of million  have automatic rollover provisions  which extend their maturity for an additional year  unless we provide at least seven months advance notice of our intention not to renew at maturity 
labranche co 
llc is entitled to prepay with written consent from the nyse the junior subordinated notes without penalty under the terms of the agreements relating thereto

in the nyse archipelago merger  in exchange for our nyse memberships  we received an aggregate of million in cash not including the permitted dividend and  shares of nyse group common stock 
we received the permitted dividend with respect to each of the nyse memberships on march   and we received the remaining merger consideration on march  as a specialist and market maker  we are required to maintain certain levels of capital and liquid assets as promulgated by various regulatory agencies which regulate our business 
as part of our overall risk management procedures for further discussion  refer to part i  item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  we attempt to balance our responsibility as specialist  market maker and broker dealer with our overall capital resources 
these requirements restrict our ability to make use of cash and other liquid assets for corporate actions  such as repaying our debt  repurchasing stock or making acquisitions 
as a broker dealer  labranche co 
llc is subject to regulatory requirements intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker dealers and requiring the maintenance of minimum levels of net capital  as defined in sec rule c labranche co 
llc is required to maintain minimum net capital  as defined  equivalent to the greater of  or

nyse rule c also prohibits a broker dealer from repaying subordinated borrowings  paying cash dividends  making loans to any parent  affiliates or employees  or otherwise entering into transactions which would result in a reduction of its total net capital to less than of its required minimum capital 
moreover  broker dealers are required to notify the sec prior to repaying subordinated borrowings  paying dividends and making loans to any parent  affiliates or employees  or otherwise entering into transactions which  if executed  would result in a reduction of or more of their excess net capital net capital less minimum requirement 
the sec has the ability to prohibit or restrict such transactions if the result is deemed detrimental to the financial integrity of the broker dealer 
as of december   labranche co 
llc s net capital  as defined  was million  which exceeded the minimum requirements by million 
the nyse generally requires its specialist firms to maintain a minimum dollar regulatory capital amount in order to establish that they can meet  with their own net liquid assets  their position requirement 
prior to september   labranche co 
llc s and lsps net liquid asset requirements were combined 
the combined requirement was satisfied by labranche co

as of december   labranche co 
llc s nyse minimum required dollar amount of net liquid assets  as defined  was million  and its actual net liquid assets  as defined  were million 
lsps net liquid assets requirement as of december  is discussed below 
as of december   labranche co 
llc s and lsps combined nyse minimum required dollar amount of net liquid assets  as defined was million  and its actual net liquid assets  as defined  were million 
labranche co 
llc thus satisfied its net liquid asset requirement as of each of those dates 
on july   the sec approved a reduction of the minimum dollar regulatory capital for a specialist in cash equities and increased the requirement for a specialist in etfs 
this reduction is to be effected in four quarterly installments  the first two of which were on september  and december  after the first installment  labranche co 
llc paid to us a dividend of million  and after the second installment  labranche co 
llc paid to us a dividend of million 
these dividend payments were mainly comprised of the nla reduction payments but also included dividends for excess regulatory capital 
labranche co 
llc s aggregate required minimum nla will be further reduced in additional installments on march  and june  the amex generally requires its equity specialist firms to maintain a cash or liquid asset position equal to the greater of a million or b an amount sufficient to assume a position of sixty trading units of each security in which the equity specialist is registered

failure by any of our broker dealer subsidiaries to maintain its required net capital and net liquid assets  where applicable  may subject it to suspension or revocation of its sec registration or its suspension or expulsion by the nyse  the amex and or any other exchange of which it is a member firm 
as evidenced by the foregoing requirements  our broker dealer subsidiaries require a substantial amount of capital 
in particular  labranche co 
llc s net liquid asset requirement of million limits our ability to utilize a substantial portion of our liquid assets for other corporate purposes 
although a portion of the combined net liquid asset requirement of million is met by labranche co 
llc s securities positions  pending trades and other assets associated with our equity specialist activities  a substantial portion of labranche co 
llc s cash and cash equivalents as of december  was used to meet its net liquid asset requirement 
on march   trading restrictions with respect to  of our  shares of nyx common stock will lapse 
it is possible that  beginning on or after march   we may use at least a portion of such  shares of nyx stock to satisfy our net capital and net liquid assets requirements at labranche co

in september  standard poors also improved its outlook on our outstanding senior notes to stable  while affirming our b rating  due to our improved debt service and liquidity positions 
there were no updates to these credit ratings by either moody s or standard poors in cash flows our cash flows are related primarily to our specialist trading activities  as well as to our financing activities related to the expansion of our business 
year ended december  our cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at the end of the increase was primarily the result of the combined effects of million of positive cash flow from earnings  a million net decrease in working capital applied to broker dealer receivables and payables and investments  a million decrease in securities purchased under an agreement to resell offset by an aggregate million decrease of net other liabilities over other assets  a million expenditure for capital assets and a million repayment of subordinated debt

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk due to regulatory requirements that prescribe communication barriers between our broker dealer subsidiaries  we employ different compliance risk management procedures at each such subsidiary 
these risk processes are set forth below our cash equity specialist risk management process because our equity specialist activities on the nyse and amex expose our capital to significant risks  managing these risks is a constant priority for us 
our central role in the hybrid market helps us to manage risks by incorporating up to date market information in the management of our inventory  subject to our specialist obligations 
we have developed a risk management process at our labranche co 
llc subsidiary that is designed to balance our ability to profit from our specialist activities with our exposure to potential losses and compliance risk 
this risk management process includes participation by our corporate compliance committee  executive operating committee  floor management committee  post managers  floor captains  specialists and chief risk officer 
these parties roles are as follows corporate compliance committee 
our corporate compliance committee was established in february and consists of representatives from executive and senior management  compliance personnel  including our on floor compliance officer  our general counsel  our chief regulatory officer and several additional senior floor specialists  known as post managers 
the role of the corporate compliance committee is to monitor and report to senior management on the statutory and regulatory compliance efforts of our specialist business 
the corporate compliance committee also advises the compliance department in establishing  reviewing and revising our policies and procedures governing labranche co 
llc s regulatory compliance structure 
executive operating committee 
our executive operating committee is composed of two executive officers 
this committee is responsible for approving all risk management procedures and trading guidelines for our specialist stocks  after receiving recommendations from our floor management committee 
in addition  our executive operating committee reviews all unusual situations reported to it by our floor management committee 
floor management committee 
our nyse floor management committee is composed of five post managers  two wheel managers  two floor managers  one swat team manager and one quality assurance manager 
this committee is responsible for formulating and overseeing our overall risk management procedures and trading guidelines for each of our specialist stocks 
in determining these procedures and guidelines  the floor management committee considers the recommendations of the floor captains 
the post managers meet with their respective floor captains on a weekly basis to review and  if necessary  revise the risk management procedures and trading guidelines for particular specialist stocks 
the wheel managers ensure that the floor is adequately staffed at all times 
in addition  post managers  wheel managers and floor captains are always available on the trading floor to review and assist with any unusual trading situations reported by a floor captain  and the swat team manager is available to assess and provide assistance on break out  or intense  trading situations 
our floor management committee reports to our executive operating committee about each of these trading situations as they occur 
our floor management committee also trains other specialists and trading assistants on a regular basis on new rules and or interpretations from the nyse with respect to our specialist obligations and guidelines  with the assistance of our compliance department 
floor captains 
we employ eight floor captains who monitor the activities of our cash equity specialists throughout the trading day from various positions at our trading posts 
the floor captains observe trades and constantly review trading activities on a real time basis 
in addition  the floor captains are readily available to assist our specialists in determining when to deviate from procedures and guidelines in reacting to any unusual situations or market conditions 
the floor captains report these unusual situations and any deviations from these procedures and guidelines to their respective post managers 
floor captains meet with each specialist at least once a week to evaluate each specialist s adherence to our risk management procedures and trading guidelines  as well as to review compliance reports generated by the compliance department in monitoring and reviewing specialist trading activities 
floor captains also meet to review risk procedures and guidelines and  if appropriate  make recommendations to the floor management committee 
specialists 
our specialists conduct electronic and  at times  manual auctions of our specialist stocks based upon the conditions of the marketplace 
in doing so  specialists observe our risk management procedures and trading guidelines in tandem with their responsibility to create and maintain a fair and orderly market 
specialists promptly notify a floor captain of any unusual situations or market conditions requiring a deviation from our procedures and guidelines 
on floor compliance officer 
we also have an on floor compliance officer that monitors the specialists compliance with nyse rules throughout the day on an ad hoc basis 
the on floor compliance officer reports his findings and on general on floor compliance initiatives on a daily basis to our equity specialist unit s chief compliance officer and chief executive officer and provides summary updates of these efforts to the corporate compliance committee on a monthly basis 
many of our compliance and risk management activities flow from the efforts of our on floor compliance initiative 
electronic exception reports 
we have implemented a system of electronic rule exception reports at our labranche co 
llc subsidiary to monitor our compliance with nyse and sec rules 
these reports are generated on a daily basis  from one to three days after each trading day  and are the result of significant development efforts from our technology group  with advice of our compliance and legal staff 
our compliance staff reviews these exception reports daily  and in the event an exception is detected  the exception is researched in detail by our on floor compliance officer or another compliance officer to determine if a compliance issue is found 
if a compliance issue is detected  we make an effort to correct the problem and conduct training of our specialists and or distribute compliance bulletins to ensure our specialists understand the rule and processes going forward 
all detected problems are discussed at our monthly compliance committee meetings 
we believe that the enhancements we have made to our compliance procedures and guidelines since  and on a continuous basis as circumstances warrant  have improved our risk management process 
our equity specialist operations on the amex are conducted by three equity specialists 
we have one post manager on the amex who monitors the trading activities of the amex equity specialists by observing trades and reviewing positions on a real time basis 
as a member of the floor management committee  the post manager regularly communicates with other members of the floor management committee regarding any deviations from our amex procedures and guidelines set by our executive operating committee

our amex on floor compliance officer also monitors problems with the amex s trading systems  which have resulted in amex initiatives and improvements 
circuit breaker rules 
the nyse and amex have instituted certain circuit breaker rules intended to halt trading in all nyse amex listed stocks in the event of a severe market decline 
the circuit breaker rules impose temporary halts in trading when the dow jones industrial average drops a certain number of points 
current circuit breaker levels are set quarterly at  and percent of the dow jones industrial average closing values of the previous month  rounded to the nearest points 
these rules provide investors extra time to respond to severe market declines and provide us an additional opportunity to assure compliance with our risk management procedures 
equity market financial risk we have developed a risk management process  which is intended to balance our ability to profit from our equity specialist activities with our exposure to potential losses 
we have invested substantial capital  along with the nyse  in real time  on line systems which give our management  including our chief risk officer  access to specific trading information during the trading day  including our aggregate long and short positions and our capital and profit and loss information on an aggregate or per issue basis 
subject to the specialist s obligation to maintain a fair and orderly market and to applicable regulatory requirements  we constantly seek to manage our trading positions relative to existing market conditions 
a high concentration of equity specialists principal trading revenue is generated from its ten and twenty five most profitable nyse specialist stocks 
the percentage of our equity specialist trading revenue generated from our ten most profitable specialist stocks has increased from to of total principal trading revenue in and  respectively 
the percentage of our equity specialist trading revenue generated from our twenty five most profitable specialist stocks has increased from to of total principal trading revenue in and  respectively 
however  we are not overly reliant on a particular group of specialist stocks  as the composition of our ten and twenty five most profitable specialist stocks changes frequently 
our equity specialist trading activities are subject to a number of risks  including risks of price fluctuations  rapid changes in the liquidity of markets and foreign exchange risk related to american depositary receipts adrs 
in any period  we may incur trading losses or gains in our specialist stocks for a variety of reasons  including price fluctuations of our specialist stocks and fulfillment of our specialist obligations 
quantification of such losses or gains would not be meaningful as standard market studies do not capture our specialist obligations 
from time to time  we may have large position concentrations in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry 
in general  because our inventory of securities is marked to market on a daily basis  any significant price movement in these securities could result in an immediate reduction of our revenues and operating profits 
our options  futures and etfs specialist and market making risk management process as specialists in options  etfs and futures  we have a responsibility to maintain a fair and orderly market  and trade securities as principal out of both obligation and inclination 
our options  etfs  futures  us government obligations and foreign currency specialist trading exposes us to certain risks  such as price and interest rate fluctuations  volatility risk  credit risk  foreign currency movements and changes in the liquidity of markets 
additionally  as a market maker in options  etfs and futures  we also from time to time trade as principal 
in our market making function  we bring immediacy and liquidity to the markets when we participate 
our market making activities expose us to certain risks  including  but not limited to  price fluctuations and volatility 
our traders purchase and sell futures  options  the stocks underlying certain positions  us government securities and foreign currencies in an attempt to hedge market and foreign currency risk 
certain members of management  including our chief risk officer  who oversee our options  futures and etfs specialist and market making activities are responsible for managing these risks 
these managers utilize a third party software application to monitor specialist and market making positions on a real time basis 
by monitoring actual and theoretical profit and loss  volatility and other standard risk measures  these individuals seek to insure that our traders operate within the parameters set by management 
furthermore  our aggregate risk in connection with our options  futures and etfs trading is under constant evaluation by certain members of management and our traders  and all significant trading strategies and positions are closely monitored 
when an unusual or large position is observed by the chief risk officer  he communicates the issue with senior management  who communicates with the trader to understand the strategy and risk management behind the trade and  if necessary  determine avenues to mitigate our risk exposure 
our options  futures and etfs trading is executed on national and foreign exchanges 
these trades clear through the options clearing corporation  the national securities clearing corporation or the applicable exchange clearing organization  thereby reducing potential credit risk 
the following chart illustrates how specified movements in the underlying securities prices of the options  futures and etfs in our specialist and market making portfolios would have impacted profits and losses profit or loss if the underlying securities move s omitted portfolio as of march  june  september  december  the modeling of the risk characteristics of our trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations 
while management believes that these assumptions and approximations are reasonable  there is no standard methodology for estimating this risk  and different methodologies would produce materially different estimates 
the zero percent change column represents the profit or loss our options  futures and etfs specialist operations would experience on a daily basis if the relevant market remained unchanged 
foreign currency risk interest rate risk in connection with the trading of us registered shares of foreign issuers in connection with our cash equity specialist operations  we are exposed to varying degrees of foreign currency risk 
the pricing of these securities is based on the value of the ordinary securities as denominated in their local currencies 
thus  a change in a foreign currency rate relative to the us dollar will result in a change in the value of us registered shares in which we are the specialist 
our etf specialists and market makers trade international etfs that are denominated and settled in us dollars  but the pricing of these etfs is also affected by changes in the relevant foreign currency rates 
we  therefore  hold various foreign currencies in order to lessen the risks posed by changing foreign currency rates 
in addition  lsp trades derivatives denominated in foreign currencies  which creates exposure to foreign currency risk 
the following chart illustrates how the specified movements in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar to which our specialist and market making activities are exposed would have impacted our profits and losses profit or loss if the foreign currencies relative to the us dollar move s omitted portfolio as of march  june  september  december  the information in the above table is based on certain assumptions and it does not fully represent the profit and loss exposure to changes in security prices  volatility  interest rates and other related factors

increasing or high interest rates and or widening credit spreads may create a less favorable operating environment for this line of business 
execution and clearing risk management process in connection with our specialist and market making activities  we are engaged in various securities trading and lending activities and assume positions in stocks  rights  options  etfs  us government securities  futures and foreign currencies for which we are exposed to credit risk associated with the nonperformance of counterparties in fulfilling their contractual obligations pursuant to these securities transactions 
we are also exposed to market risk associated with the sale of securities not yet purchased  which can be directly impacted by volatile trading on the nyse  amex and other exchanges 
additionally  in the event of nonperformance and unfavorable market price movements  we may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments at a loss 
our execution and clearing activities require that we execute transactions in accordance with customer instructions and accurately record and process the resulting transactions 
any failure  delay or error in executing  recording and processing transactions  whether due to human error or failure of our information or communication systems  could cause substantial losses for brokers  customers and or us and could subject us to claims for losses 
clearing activities include settling each transaction with both the contra broker and the customer

settling transactions for retail customers and professional investors involves financing the transaction until the customer makes payment or  for margin accounts  advancing credit to the customer within regulatory and internal guidelines 
clearing direct access brokers transactions includes guaranteeing their transactions to the contra broker on the exchange floor 
these clearing activities may expose us to off balance sheet risk in the event customers or brokers are unable to fulfill their contractual obligations and it is necessary to purchase or sell securities at a loss 
for margin transactions  we may be exposed to off balance sheet risk in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur in their accounts 
the amount of risk related to our execution and clearance activities is linked to the size of the transaction  market volatility and the creditworthiness of customers and brokers 
our largest transactions involve those for institutional and direct access floor brokerage customers 
we systematically monitor our open transaction risk in connection with our execution and clearing activities  starting when the transaction occurs and continuing until the designated settlement date 
transactions that remain unsettled after settlement date are scrutinized and necessary action to reduce risk is taken 
credit risk that could result from contra brokers defaulting is minimized since much of the settlement risk for transactions with brokers is essentially transferred to the national stock clearing corporation 
the credit risk associated with institutional and direct access clearing customers is minimized since these customers have been qualified by the depository trust company dtc or the dtc participants or have met the prime broker qualification standards at other brokerage firms 
before conducting business with a prospective customer  senior management that oversees our execution and clearing operations  in conjunction with the related compliance department  reviews the prospective customer s experience in the securities industry  financial condition and personal background  including a background check with a risk reporting agency 
for retail customers and professional investors  we seek to control the risks associated with customer activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with various regulatory and internal guidelines 
we monitor margin levels daily pursuant to such guidelines and require customers to deposit additional collateral or reduce positions when necessary
