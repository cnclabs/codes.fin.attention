critical accounting policies general 
north valley bancorp s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our financial statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan and lease portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use 
other estimates that we use are related to the expected useful lives of our depreciable assets 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact the accounting for such transactions could change 
a summary of the company s most significant accounting policies and accounting estimates is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
an accounting estimate recognized in the financial statements is a critical accounting estimate if the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and different estimates that management could reasonably have used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
management considers the company s allowance for loan and lease losses  pro forma costs related to the company s share based payments programs  and management s assessment of goodwill and investment impairment to be critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan and lease losses 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is based on the probable estimated losses in our loan and lease portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting statement of financial accountings standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued on impaired loans as defined based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is established through a provision for loan and lease losses based on management s evaluation of the risks inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
in determining levels of risk  management considers a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  asset classifications  economic trends  industry experience and trends  geographic concentrations  estimated collateral values  historical loan and lease loss experience  and the company s underwriting policies 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is maintained at an amount management considers adequate to cover losses in loans and leases receivable which are considered probable and estimable 
while management uses the best information available to make these estimates  future adjustments to allowances may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory  and other conditions that may be beyond the company s control 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan and lease losses 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on judgments different from those of management
