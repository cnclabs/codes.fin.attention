amortization of acquired intangible assets in thousands  except percentages amortization of acquired intangible assets as a percentage of net revenues from time to time we have purchased  and we expect to continue purchasing  assets or businesses to accelerate category and geographic expansion  increase the features  functions  and formats available to our users and maintain a leading role in online e commerce  payments and communications 
these purchase transactions generally result in the creation of acquired intangible assets with finite lives and lead to a corresponding increase in the amortization expense in future periods 
we amortize intangible assets over the period of estimated benefit  using the straight line method and estimated useful lives ranging from one to eight years 
the increase in amortization of acquired amortizable intangibles during and compared to prior years is due to the business acquisitions consummated during  and amortization of acquired intangible assets may increase should we make additional acquisitions in the future

provision for income taxes in thousands  except percentages provision for income taxes as a percentage of net revenues effective tax rate the provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory us federal rate principally due to state taxes  subsidiary losses for which we have not provided a benefit and other factors that increase the effective tax rate  offset by decreases resulting from foreign income with lower effective tax rates and tax credits 
the lower effective tax rates in as compared to and resulted primarily from the expansion of our international businesses and from changes in our operations in international markets 
we expect the effective tax rate for to be consistent with impact of foreign currency translation during  and  our international net revenues  based upon the country in which the seller  payment recipient  skype user s internet protocol address  advertiser or other service provider is located  accounted for approximately  and  of our consolidated net revenues  respectively 
the growth in our international operations has increased our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
net revenues and related expenses generated from most international locations are denominated in the functional currencies of the local countries  and primarily include euros  british pounds  korean won  canadian dollars  australian dollars  chinese renminbi  and indian rupees 
our results of operations and certain of our inter company balances associated with our international locations are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the statements of income of our international operations are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased consolidated net revenues  operating expenses  and net income 
similarly  our net revenues  operating expenses  and net income will decrease if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 

table of contents net revenues were positively impacted by foreign currency translation by approximately million in and million in as compared to the same periods of the prior year 
operating income was positively impacted by foreign currency translation by approximately million in and million in  as compared to the same periods of the prior year 
we expect our international operations will continue to grow in significance 
as a result  the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in future periods could become more significant and may have a negative impact on our consolidated net revenues and net income in the event the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies 
see the information in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk under the caption foreign currency risk for additional discussion of the impact of foreign currency translation and related hedging activities 
foreign currency exposures we are a rapidly growing company  with an increasing proportion of our operations outside the united states 
accordingly  our foreign currency exposures have increased substantially and are expected to continue to grow 
the objective of our foreign exchange exposure management program is to identify material foreign currency exposures and to manage these exposures to minimize the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flow and results of operations 
our primary foreign currency exposures are transaction  economic and translation transaction exposure around the world  we have certain assets and liabilities  primarily receivables  investments and accounts payable including inter company transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity s functional currency 
in certain circumstances  changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other instruments to minimize the short term foreign currency fluctuations on such assets and liabilities 
the gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts offset the transaction gains and losses on certain foreign currency receivables  investments and payables recognized in earnings 
economic exposure we also have anticipated future cash flows  including revenues and expenses  denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity s functional currency 
our primary economic exposures include future royalty receivables  customer collections  and vendor payments 
changes in the relevant entity s functional currency value will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive when these cash flows are realized or settled 
we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other derivatives to hedge the value of a portion of these cash flows 
we account for these foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges 
the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the transaction is settled 
earnings translation exposure as our international operations grow  fluctuations in the foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our foreign denominated subsidiaries 
we may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset the earnings impact of currency fluctuations 
such contracts will be marked to market on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss will be recorded in interest and other income  net 
employee stock based incentive plans we continue to believe that employee stock based incentive plans represent an appropriate and essential component of our overall compensation program 
we grant stock based awards to substantially all employees and believe that this broad based program helps us to attract  motivate  and retain high quality employees  to the ultimate benefit of our stockholders 
we granted a limited number of restricted stock units and restricted stock awards to employees during stock options  restricted stock units and restricted stock awards granted during the years ended december  and  net of cancellations forfeitures  represented less than of our total common stock outstanding as of december  and a substantial portion of our stock based awards granted during the year were granted to existing employees 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flows year ended december  in thousands consolidated cash flow data net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents we have generated annual cash provided by operating activities in amounts greater than net income in  and due primarily to non cash charges to earnings and the tax benefit on the exercise of stock options 
non cash charges to earnings included stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization on our long term assets  provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits resulting from increasing revenues and the provision for transaction losses related to paypal 
prior to adopting fas r  we presented all tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
fas r requires cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits to be classified as a part of cash flows from financing activities 
excess tax benefits represent tax benefits related to exercised options in excess of the associated deferred tax asset for such options 
as a result of adopting fas r  million of excess tax benefits for have been reported as a cash inflow from financing activities 
in addition  as a substantial portion of the company s net operating losses and carryforward credits have now been utilized  cash will be required for tax payments in the us going forward 
total us and foreign income tax payments will be dependent on our taxable income and are estimated to be in the range of million in in  we expect operating cash flows to increase  primarily driven by higher net income 
the net cash provided by investing activities in was primarily due to the movement of investments to cash and cash equivalents to fund our stock repurchase program 
the net cash used in investing activities in and reflected primarily the movement of cash and cash equivalents between cash and cash equivalents and investments  the purchase of property and equipment  and acquisitions 
purchases of property and equipment  net totaled million in  million in  and million in purchases of property and equipment in  and related mainly to purchases of computer equipment and software to support our site operations  customer support and international expansion 
cash expended for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  totaled approximately million in  billion in  and billion in in  net cash payments for acquisitions consisted of the cash payment  net of cash acquired  for the acquisition of tradera

in  our cash acquisitions included the acquisition of mobile 
de  baazee 
com  and marktplaats 
nl  as well as an additional ownership interest in internet auction co 
in  we expect to continue to purchase property and equipment and we may acquire businesses with cash that would impact investing cash flows 
the net cash flows used in financing activities of billion in was primarily due to the repurchase of approximately million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion  offset by the proceeds from stock options totaling million 
prior to  we had not repurchased our common stock under a stock repurchase program 
the net cash flows provided by financing activities in and were due primarily to proceeds from stock option exercises 
proceeds from stock option exercises totaled million in and million in our future cash flows from stock options are difficult to project 
table of contents as such amounts are a function of our stock price  the number of options outstanding and the decisions by employees to exercise stock options 
in general  we expect proceeds from stock option exercises to increase during periods in which our stock price has increased relative to historical levels 
in july  our board authorized the repurchase of up to billion of the company s common stock within two years from the date of authorization 
during  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an average price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of billion 
as of december   billion remained available for further purchases under this program 
in january  our board authorized  and the company announced  an expansion of the stock repurchase program to provide for the repurchase of up to an additional billion of our common stock over the next two years 
share repurchases under our repurchase program may take a variety of forms  including structured stock repurchase programs and other derivative transactions 
we expect to continue to repurchase our common stock in  thereby impacting financing cash flows 
the positive effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during and was due to the weakening of the us dollar against other foreign currencies  primarily the euro 
the negative effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during was due to the strengthening of the us dollar against other foreign currencies  primarily the euro 
in november  we entered into a credit agreement which provides for an unsecured billion five year revolving credit facility 
loans under the credit agreement will bear interest at either i libor plus a margin ranging from percent to percent or ii a formula based on the prime rate or on the federal funds effective rate 
subject to certain conditions stated in the credit agreement  we may borrow  prepay and reborrow amounts under the credit facility at any time during the term of the credit agreement 
funds borrowed under the credit agreement may be used for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 
in february  we borrowed against the line of credit in the amount of million 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and investments of approximately billion  together with cash generated from operations and cash available through the existing credit agreement  will be sufficient to fund our operating activities  capital expenditures  stock repurchases and other obligations for the foreseeable future 
commitments and contingencies we have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments 
changes in our business needs  cancellation provisions  changing interest rates  and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments 
we have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the tables  in order to assist in the review of this information within the context of our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
the following table summarizes our fixed contractual obligations and commitments in thousands operating purchase payments due by year ending december  leases obligations total thereafter operating lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non cancelable operating leases for office facilities  as well as limited computer and office equipment that we utilize under lease arrangements 
the amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly  unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to exit an office facility early or expand our occupied space 

table of contents purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising  capital expenditures computer equipment  software applications  engineering development services  construction contracts and other goods and services that were entered into through our ordinary course of business 
for those contractual arrangements in which there are significant performance requirements  we have developed estimates to project expected payment obligations 
these estimates have been developed based upon historical trends  when available  and our anticipated future obligations 
given the significance of such performance requirements within our advertising and other arrangements  actual payments could differ significantly from these estimates 
in conjunction with our skype acquisition  we have certain earn out payment commitments  not included in table above  that are contingent upon skype achieving certain net revenues  gross profit margin based targets and active user targets

off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
all customer funds held by paypal as an agent or custodian on behalf of our customers are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
these funds include funds held in the us that are deposited in bank accounts insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation and funds that customers choose to invest in paypal s money market fund totaling approximately billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
indemnification provisions in the ordinary course of business we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with whom we have commercial relations  including our standard marketing  promotions and application programming interface license agreements 
under these contracts  we generally indemnify  hold harmless  and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by any third party with respect to domain names  trademarks  logos and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are applicable to our performance under the subject agreement 
in a limited number of agreements  we have provided an indemnity for other types of third party claims  substantially all of which are indemnities related to copyrights  trademarks  and patents 
in our paypal business  we have provided an indemnity to our payment processors in the event of certain third party claims or card association fines against the processor arising out of conduct by paypal 
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision 
to date  no significant costs have been incurred  either individually or collectively  in connection with our indemnification provisions 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates general the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical 
table of contents accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the following descriptions of critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this report 
provisions for doubtful accounts and authorized credits we are exposed to losses due to uncollectible accounts and credits to sellers 
provisions for these items represent our estimate of actual losses and credits based on our historical experience  are monitored monthly  and are made at the time the related revenue is recognized 
the provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as a charge to operating expense  while the authorized credits are recorded as a reduction of revenues 
the following table illustrates the provision related to doubtful accounts and authorized credits as a percentage of net revenues for   and in thousands  except percentages year ended december  net revenues provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits provision for doubtful accounts and authorized credits as a of net revenues historically  our actual losses and credits have been consistent with these provisions 
however  future changes in trends could result in a material impact to future consolidated statements of income and cash flows 
based on our results for the year ended december   a basis point deviation from our estimates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income of approximately million 
the following analysis demonstrates  for illustrative purposes only  the potential effect a basis point deviation from our estimates would have upon our consolidated financial statements and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation in thousands  except per share data basis basis points points provision for doubtful accounts and related authorized credits income from operations net income diluted earnings per share provision for transaction losses our payments segment is exposed to transaction losses due to credit card and other payment misuse  as well as non performance of sellers who accept payment through paypal 
we establish allowances for estimated losses arising from processing customer transactions  such as charge backs for unauthorized credit card use and merchant related charge backs due to non delivery of goods or services  automated clearing house  or ach  returns  buyer protection program claims and debit card overdrafts 
these allowances represent an accumulation of the estimated amounts necessary to provide for transaction losses incurred as of the reporting date  including those of which we have not yet been notified 
the allowances  which involve the use of actuarial techniques  are monitored monthly and are updated based on actual claims data reported by our claims processors 
the allowances are based on known facts and circumstances  internal factors including our experience with similar cases  historical trends involving loss payment patterns and the mix of transaction and loss types 
the provision for transaction losses is reflected as a general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income 
at december   the allowance for transaction losses totaled million and was included in other current assets and accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents the following table illustrates the provision for transaction losses as a percentage of total payment volume from paypal operations for the years ended december   and in thousands  except percentages year ended december  total payment volume transaction loss expense as a of total payment volume determining appropriate allowances for transaction losses is an inherently uncertain process  and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates 
we regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses 
the allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date 
based on our results for the year ended december   a five basis point deviation from our estimates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in our operating expenses of approximately million 
the following analysis demonstrates  for illustrative purposes only  the potential effect a five basis point deviation from our estimates would have upon our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation in thousands  except per share data basis basis points points transaction loss expense income from operations net income diluted earnings per share legal contingencies in connection with certain pending litigation and other claims  we have estimated the range of probable loss and provided for such losses through charges to our consolidated statement of income 
these estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business  and we do not expect this trend to change in the future 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in item legal proceedings and note commitments and contingencies litigation and other legal matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us  and we will defend ourselves vigorously 
however  even if successful  our defense against certain actions will be costly and could divert our management s time 
if the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims  we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees  modify our business practices or even be prohibited from conducting a significant part of our business 
any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of all or any of our three businesses 
accounting for income taxes we are required to recognize a provision for income taxes based upon the taxable income and temporary differences for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires a calculation of taxes payable under currently enacted tax laws around the world and an analysis of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities  including various accruals  allowances  depreciation and amortization 
the tax effect of these temporary differences and the estimated tax benefit from our tax net operating losses are reported as deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
we also assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized  we establish a valuation allowance 
at december   we had a valuation allowance on certain foreign net operating losses based on our assessment 
table of contents that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our tax provision in our consolidated statement of income 
our us businesses generate sufficient cash flow to fully fund their operating requirements  and we expect that profits earned outside the us will be fully utilized to fund our continued international expansion 
accordingly  we have not provided for us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of december   because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely 
in the event that our future international expansion plans change and such amounts are not reinvested indefinitely  we would be subject to us income taxes partially offset by foreign tax credits 
the following table illustrates the effective tax rates for   and in thousands  except percentages year ended december  provision for income taxes as a of income before income taxes historically  these provisions have adequately provided for our actual income tax liabilities 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuations of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or by changes or interpretations in tax laws  regulations or accounting principles 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
based on our results for the year ended december   a one percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of approximately million 
the following analysis demonstrates  for illustrative purposes only  the potential effect such a one percentage point deviation change would have upon our consolidated financial statements and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation in thousands  except per share data basis basis points points provision for income taxes income from operations net income diluted earnings per share advertising and other revenues a portion of our net revenues result from fees associated with advertising and other services 
net revenues from advertising are derived principally from the sale of online advertisements for cash and through barter arrangements 
other net revenues are derived principally from contractual arrangements with third parties that provide transaction services to ebay and paypal users and interest earned from banks on certain paypal customer account balances 
advertising and other net revenues  including barter transactions  totaled of our consolidated net revenues for each of the years ended december   and  and were primarily generated by our marketplaces segment 
revenue from barter arrangements totaled million in  million in and million in certain judgments are involved in the determination of the appropriate revenue recognition  including  but not limited to  the assessment and allocation of fair values in multiple element arrangements  the appropriateness of gross or net revenue recognition and  for barter transactions  the existence of comparable cash transactions to establish fair values 
our advertising and other net revenues may be affected by the financial condition of the parties with whom we have these relationships and by the success of online services and promotions in general 
unlike our transaction revenues  advertising and other net revenues are derived from a relatively concentrated customer base 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill 
the determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates 
these judgments can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital 
at december  our goodwill totaled billion and our identifiable intangible assets totaled million 
we assess the impairment of goodwill of our reportable units annually  or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
this assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and analysis of our market capitalization 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by our management 
our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to its business model or changes in operating performance 
additionally  certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models which increase the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of august  and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill for any of our reportable units was required 
we have determined that no events or circumstances from that date through december  indicate that a further assessment was necessary 
there was no impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets in  and stock based compensation on january   we adopted fas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases based on estimated fair values 
stock based compensation expense recognized for was million  which consisted of stock based compensation expense related to stock options and employee stock purchases 
for and  stock based compensation expense of million and million  respectively  was recognized under previous accounting standards 
see note stock based plans to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for additional information 
we calculated the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
the use of a black scholes model requires extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and a number of complex assumptions including expected life  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted during was per share  using the black scholes model with the following weighted average assumptions risk free interest rates expected life years dividend yield expected volatility our computation of expected volatility for was based on a combination of historical and market based implied volatility from traded options on our stock 
prior to  our computation of expected volatility was based on historical volatility 
our computation of expected life was determined based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
the interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which is a change in accounting for income taxes 
among other provisions  fin specifies how tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are to be recognized  measured  and derecognized in financial statements  requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters  specifies how reserves for uncertain tax positions should be classified on the balance sheet  and provides transition and interim period guidance 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and as a result  is effective for us in the first quarter of we have not yet completed our evaluation of the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements fas 
fas establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the changes to current practice resulting from the application of this statement relate to the definition of fair value  the methods used to measure fair value  and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
we will be required to adopt the provisions on fas beginning with our first quarter ending march  we do not believe that the adoption of the provisions of fas will materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
effective december   we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r  fas 
these provisions did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
fas requires an employer to recognize the over funded or under funded status of a defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity 
this statement also requires plan assets and obligations to be measured as of the employer s balance sheet date 
the measurement provision of this statement will be effective for years beginning after december  with early adoption encouraged 
we have not yet adopted the measurement date provisions of this statement 
in  we adopted staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab  which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
the adoption of sab did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including government and corporate securities and money market funds 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of estimated tax 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk 
the fair market value of our fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
in general  securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities 
while floating rate securities generally are subject to less interest rate risk than fixed rate securities  floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease 
due in part to these factors  our investment income may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if securities are sold that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   our fixed income investments earned a pretax yield of approximately  with a weighted average maturity of two months 
if interest rates were to instantaneously increase decrease by basis points  the fair market value of our total investment portfolio could decrease increase by approximately million 

table of contents equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk on the marketable portion of equity instruments and equity method investments we hold  typically as the result of strategic investments in third parties that are subject to considerable market risk due to their volatility 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure in these equity investments 
we did not record an impairment charge during the years ended december   or relating to the other than temporary impairment in the fair value of equity investments 
at december   the total carrying value of our equity instruments and equity method investments was million 
foreign currency risk international net revenues result from transactions by our foreign operations and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these operations also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  certain foreign operations use the local currency  which is primarily the euro  and to a lesser extent  the british pound  as their functional currency 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
in addition  at december   we held balances in cash  cash equivalents and investments outside the us totaling approximately billion 
transaction exposure as of december   we had outstanding forward foreign exchange hedge contracts with notional values equivalent to approximately million with maturity dates within days 
the hedge contracts are used to offset changes in the functional currency value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as a result of currency fluctuations 
transaction gains and losses on the contracts and the assets and liabilities are recognized each period in our consolidated statement of income 
translation exposure foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position for the year ended december   was a net translation gain of approximately million 
this gain is recognized as an adjustment to stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income 
additionally  foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of income 
we consolidate the earnings of our international subsidiaries by converting them into us dollars in accordance with sfas no 
foreign currency translation fas 
such earnings will fluctuate when there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency denominated earnings translation exposure using either forward exchange contracts or other instruments 
all contracts that hedge translation exposure mature ratably over the quarter in which they are executed 
during the year ended december   the realized gains and losses related to these hedges were not significant 
a hypothetical uniform strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro  british pound and korean won in which our revenues and profits are denominated would result in a decrease increase to operating income of approximately million 
there are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented  primarily due to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous 
as a result  the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise  which may positively or negatively affect income 

table of contents economic exposure we currently charge our international subsidiaries on a monthly basis for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services provided by ebay and paypal 
these charges are denominated in euros and these forecasted inter company transactions represent a foreign currency cash flow exposure 
to reduce foreign exchange risk relating to these forecasted inter company transactions  we entered into forward exchange contracts or other instruments during the year ended december  the objective of the forward contracts is to ensure that the us dollar equivalent cash flows are not adversely affected by changes in the us dollar euro exchange rate 
pursuant to sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  we expect the hedge of certain of these forecasted transactions using the forward contracts to be highly effective in offsetting potential changes in cash flows attributed to a change in the us dollar euro exchange rate 
accordingly  we record as a component of other comprehensive income all unrealized gains and losses related to the forward contracts that receive hedge accounting treatment 
we record all unrealized gains and losses in interest and accumulated other income  net  related to the forward contracts that do not receive hedge accounting treatment pursuant to fas during the years ended december   and  the realized gains and losses related to these hedges were not significant 
the notional amount of our economic hedges receiving hedge accounting treatment and the losses  net of gains  recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income as of december  was million and million  respectively 
the notional amount of our economic hedges receiving hedge accounting treatment and the loss  net of gains  recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income as of december  was million and  respectively 
we did not have any economic hedges in place as of december
