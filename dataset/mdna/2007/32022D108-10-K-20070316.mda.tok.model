item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital 
the federal deposit insurance corporation act of fdicia  among other things  identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
the corporation and the bank are classified as well capitalized 
fdicia also requires the bank regulatory agencies to implement systems for prompt corrective action for institutions that fail to meet minimum capital requirements within these five categories  with progressively more severe restrictions on operations  management and capital distributions according to the category in which an institution is placed 
failure to meet capital requirements can also cause an institution to be directed to raise additional capital 
fdicia also mandates that the agencies adopt safety and soundness standards relating generally to operations and management  asset quality and executive compensation  and authorizes administrative action against an institution that fails to meet such standards 
in addition  the federal reserve board and the fdic have each adopted risk based capital standards that explicitly identify concentrations of credit risk and the risk arising from non traditional activities  as well as an institution s ability to manage these risks  as important factors to be taken into account by each agency in assessing an institution s overall capital adequacy 
the capital guidelines also provide that an institution s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates be considered by the agency as a factor in evaluating a banking organization s capital adequacy 
in addition to the prompt corrective action directives  failure to meet capital guidelines can subject a banking organization to a variety of other enforcement remedies  including additional substantial restrictions on its operations and activities  termination of deposit insurance by the fdic  and under some conditions the appointment of a conservator or receiver 
deposit insurance 
our deposits are insured by the fdic up to the statutory maximum limit of  per depositor through saif 
for this protection  we must pay semiannual assessments to the fdic 
the assessment rate for an insured depository institution depends on the assessment risk classification assigned to the institution by the fdic  which will be determined by the institution s capital level and supervisory evaluations 
dividends 
the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank 
the majority of our revenue is from dividends we receive from the bank 
the bank is subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends it can pay 
if  in the opinion of a federal regulatory agency  an institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice  the agency may require  after notice and hearing  that the institution cease and desist from such practice 
the federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete an institution s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
under fdicia  an insured institution may not pay a dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized 
moreover  the federal reserve and the fdic have issued policy statements providing that bank holding companies and banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings 
under kentucky law  dividends by kentucky banks may be paid only from current or retained net profits 
before any dividend may be declared for any period other than with respect to preferred stock  a bank must increase its capital surplus by at least of the net profits of the bank for the period until the bank s capital surplus equals the amount of its stated capital attributable to its common stock 
moreover  the kofi commissioner must approve the declaration of dividends if the total dividends to be declared by a bank for any calendar year would exceed the bank s total net profits for such year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years  less any required transfers to surplus or a fund for the retirement of preferred stock or debt 
we are also subject to the kentucky business corporation act  which generally prohibits dividends to the extent they result in the insolvency of the corporation from a balance sheet perspective or if becoming unable to pay debts as they come due 
consumer protection laws 
we are subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population 
these laws include the equal credit opportunity act  the fair credit reporting act  the truth in lending act  the home mortgage disclosure act  and the real estate settlement procedures act  and state law counterparts 
federal law currently contains extensive customer privacy protections provisions 
under these provisions  a financial institution must provide to its customers  at the inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter  the institution s policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers nonpublic personal financial information 
these provisions also provide that  except for certain limited exceptions  an institution may not provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that such information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure 
federal law makes it a criminal offense  except in limited circumstances  to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means 
the community reinvestment act cra requires the fdic to assess our record in meeting the credit needs of the communities we serve  including low and moderate income neighborhoods and persons 
the fdic s assessment of our record is made available to the public 
the assessment also is part of the federal reserve board s consideration of applications to acquire  merge or consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company  to establish a new branch office or to relocate an office 
the federal reserve board will also assess the cra record of the subsidiary banks of a bank holding company in its consideration of any application to acquire a bank or other bank holding company  which may be the basis for denying the application 
bank secrecy act 
the bank secrecy act of bsa was enacted to deter money laundering  establish regulatory reporting standards for currency transactions and improve detection and investigation of criminal  tax and other regulatory violations 
bsa and subsequent laws and regulations require us to take steps to prevent the use of the bank in the flow of illegal or illicit money  including  without limitation  ensuring effective management oversight  establishing sound policies and procedures  developing effective monitoring and reporting capabilities  ensuring adequate training and establishing a comprehensive internal audit of bsa compliance activities 
in recent years  federal regulators have increased the attention paid to compliance with the provisions of bsa and related laws  with particular attention paid to know your customer practices 
banks have been encouraged by regulators to enhance their identification procedures prior to accepting new customers in order to deter criminal elements from using the banking system to move and hide illegal and illicit activities 
usa patriot act 
the usa patriot act of the patriot act contains anti money laundering measures affecting insured depository institutions  broker dealers and certain other financial institutions 
the patriot act requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism  including standards for verifying customer identification at account opening  and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions  regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering 
the patriot act also grants the secretary of the treasury broad authority to establish regulations and to impose requirements and restrictions on financial institutions operations 
in addition  the patriot act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution s anti money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and bank holding company acquisitions

risk factors we  like other financial companies  are subject to a number of risks  many of which are outside of our management s control 
we strive to manage risks while optimizing returns 
the principal risks that affect our business are a credit risk  which is the risk that loan and lease customers or other counterparties will be unable to perform their contractual obligations  b market risk  which is the risk that changes in market rates and prices will adversely affect our financial condition or results of operation  c liquidity risk  which is the risk that we will have insufficient cash or access to cash to meet our operating needs  and d operational risk  which is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people  and systems  or from external events 
the risks identified below  as well as in the other cautionary statements made throughout this report  identify factors that could materially and adversely affect our business  future results of operations  and future cash flows 
credit risk we extend credit to a variety of customers based on internally set standards and the judgment of management 
we manage the credit risk it takes through a program of underwriting standards that we follow  the review of certain credit decisions  and an on going process of assessment of the quality of the credit we have already extended 
if our credit standards and our on going process of credit assessment do not function as intended  we could incur significant credit losses 
our loans and deposits are focused in central kentucky 
adverse economic conditions in that region  in particular  could harm our results from operations  cash flows  and financial condition 
adverse economic conditions and other factors  such as legislative or business developments or natural hazards that may affect kentucky  may reduce demand for credit or fee based products and could negatively affect real estate and other collateral values  interest rate levels  and the availability of credit to refinance loans at or before maturity 
market risk changes in interest rates could harm our financial condition or results of operations 
our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income  the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets such as investments and loans and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions 
factors beyond our control  such as inflation  recession  unemployment  and money supply may also affect interest rates 
if our interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than our interest bearing liabilities in a given period  as a result of decreasing interest rates  our net interest income may decrease 
likewise  our net interest income may decrease if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a given period as a result of increasing interest rates 
fixed rate loans increase our exposure to interest rate risk in a rising rate environment because interest bearing liabilities would be subject to repricing before assets become subject to repricing 
adjustable rate loans decrease the risk associated with changes in interest rates but involve other risks  such as the inability of borrowers to make higher payments in an increasing interest rate environment 
at the same time  for secured loans  the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates 
in a declining interest rate environment  there may be an increase in prepayments on loans as the borrowers refinance their loans at lower interest rates  which could reduce net interest income and harm our results of operations 
liquidity risk if we cannot borrow funds through access to the capital markets  we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers  or meet the operating cash needs of the corporation to fund corporate expansion or other activities 
our liquidity policies and limits are established by the board of directors  with operating limits set by the asset liability committee alco  based upon analyses of the ratio of loans to deposits  the percentage of assets funded with non core or wholesale funding 
the alco regularly monitors the overall liquidity position of the bank and the corporation to ensure that various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity 
liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost 
if our liquidity policies and strategies don t work as well as intended  then we may be unable to make loans and to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers 
the alco follows established board approved policies and monitors guidelines to diversify our wholesale funding sources to avoid concentrations in any one market source 
wholesale funding sources include federal funds purchased  securities sold under repurchase agreements  non core brokered deposits  and medium and long term debt  which includes federal home loan bank fhlb advances that are collateralized with mortgage related assets 
we maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity 
there are other available sources of liquidity  including the sale or securitization of loans  the ability to acquire additional non core brokered deposits  additional collateralized borrowings such as fhlb advances  the issuance of debt securities  and the issuance of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions 
if we were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed  we might not be able to meet the needs of our customers  which could adversely impact our financial condition  our results of operations  cash flows  and our level of regulatory qualifying capital 
for further discussion  see the liquidity section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
operational risk we have significant competition in both attracting and retaining deposits and in originating loans 
competition is intense in most of the markets we serve 
we compete on price and service with other banks and financial companies such as commercial banks  savings institutions  credit unions  finance companies  insurance companies  mortgage banking companies  and brokerage firms 
competition could intensify in the future as a result of industry consolidation  the increasing availability of products and services from non banks  greater technological developments in the industry  and banking reform 
if our competition prices deposits or loans at rates significantly more favorable than ours  then we may have difficulty in both attracting and retaining deposits and loans 
management maintains internal operational controls and we have invested in technology to help us process large volumes of transactions 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue processing at the same or higher levels of transactions 
if our systems of internal controls should fail to work as expected  if our systems were to be used in an unauthorized manner  or if employees were to subvert the system of internal controls  significant losses could occur 
we process large volumes of transactions on a daily basis and are exposed to numerous types of operation risk  which could cause us to incur substantial losses 
operational risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people  and systems includes the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of our company  the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees  errors relating to transaction processing and systems  and breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements 
this risk of loss also includes potential legal actions that could arise as a result of the operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards 
we establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide management with timely and accurate information about our level of operational risk 
while not foolproof  these systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate  cost effective levels 
we have also established procedures that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct  ethics  and business practices are followed 
from time to time  we experience loss from operational risk  including the effects of operational errors  and these losses may be substantial 
while management continually monitors and improves our system of internal controls  data processing systems  and corporate wide processes and procedures  there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future 
new  or changes in existing tax  accounting  are regulatory laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations could significantly impact strategic initiatives  results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition 
the financial services industry is extensively regulated 
federal and state banking regulations are designed primarily to protect deposit insurance funds and consumers  not to benefit a financial company s shareholders 
these regulations may sometimes impose significant limitations on operations 
the significant federal and state banking regulations that affect us are described in this report under the heading regulation 
these regulations  along with currently existing tax  accounting  and monetary laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business  implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance  and govern financial reporting and disclosures 
these laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time 
events that may not have a direct impact on us  such as the bankruptcy of us companies  can cause legislators  regulators  and authoritative bodies  such as the financial accounting standards board  the sec  the public company accounting oversight board  and other various taxing authorities to respond by adopting and or proposing substantive revisions to laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations 
the nature  extent  and timing of the adoption of significant new laws and regulations  or changes in or repeal of existing laws and regulations may have a material impact on our business and results of operations 
changes in regulation may cause us to devote substantial additional financial resources and management time to compliance  which may negatively affect our operating results

this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other detailed information 
overview we conduct operations in full service banking centers in six contiguous counties in central kentucky along the interstate corridor 
our markets range from the major metropolitan area of louisville in jefferson county  kentucky approximately miles north of our headquarters in elizabethtown  kentucky to hart county  kentucky  approximately miles south of elizabethtown 
our core markets have experienced a compound annual growth rate of in deposits for the past five years 
we anticipate that our markets will continue to grow at a similar rate for the next few years and believe we are well positioned to benefit from this anticipated growth 
over the past several years we have focused on enhancing and expanding our retail and commercial banking network in our core markets as well as establishing our presence in the louisville market 
our core markets  where we have a combined market share  have become increasingly competitive as several new banks have entered the five counties other than louisville jefferson county in the past few years 
in order to protect and grow our market share  we replaced existing branches with newer  enhanced facilities and anticipate constructing several new facilities over the next few years 
in addition to the enhancement and expansion in our core markets  we have been increasing our presence in the louisville market 
approximately of the deposit base in the louisville market is controlled by six out of state banks 
while the market is very competitive  we believe this creates an opportunity for smaller community banks with more power to make decisions locally 
we believe our investment in these initiatives along with our continued commitment to a high level of customer service will enhance our market share in our core markets and our development in the louisville market 
our retail branch network continues to generate encouraging results 
total deposits have grown at a compound annual growth rate over the past five years 
total deposits were million at december   an increase of million  or for the year 
the continued development of the retail branch network into the louisville market also yielded positive results 
we have a combined million in deposits in our two full service facilities in the louisville market representing a increase in deposits for the year 
we opened these facilities in the second quarter of to support our growing customer base in this market and have started construction on a new full service banking center in the louisville market with plans of opening in early we have developed a strong commercial real estate niche in our markets 
we have an experienced team of bankers who are focused on providing service and convenience to our customers 
it is quite common for our bankers to close loans at a customer s place of business or even the customer s personal residence 
this high level of service has been especially well received in our louisville market  which is dominated by regional banks 
currently  twenty two percent of our loan portfolio resides in the louisville market 
to further develop our commercial banking relationships in louisville  we anticipate opening a private banking office in early this office will be an upscale facility complementing our retail branch network in louisville allowing us to further attract commercial deposit relationships in conjunction with our commercial lending relationships 
this emphasis on commercial lending generated an compound annual growth rate in the total loan portfolio and a compound annual growth rate in commercial loans over the past three years 
commercial loans were million at december   an increase of million  or  from december  commercial checking balances were million at december  we have experienced a compound annual growth rate in commercial checking accounts over the past three years 
the growth in our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolio  coupled with our efforts to fund these loans with lower cost customer deposits is our primary business model and has substantially contributed to the growth in earnings over the past several years 
application of critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies comply with us generally accepted accounting principles and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses is critical to the understanding of our results of operations since the application of this policy requires significant management assumptions and estimates that could result in materially different amounts to be reported if conditions or underlying circumstances were to change 
allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance sufficient to absorb probable incurred credit losses existing in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan loss review committee evaluates the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
we estimate the allowance using past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of the underlying collateral  and current economic conditions 
while we estimate the allowance for loan losses based in part on historical losses within each loan category  estimates for losses within the commercial and commercial real estate portfolio are more dependent upon credit analysis and recent payment performance 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans or loan categories  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
the allowance consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired or loans otherwise classified as substandard or doubtful 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors 
the methodology for allocating the allowance for loan and lease losses takes into account our strategic plan to increase our emphasis on commercial and consumer lending 
we increase the amount of the allowance allocated to commercial loans and consumer loans in response to the growth of the commercial and consumer loan portfolios and management s recognition of the higher risks and loan losses in these lending areas 
allowance estimates are developed with actual loss experience adjusted for current economic conditions 
allowance estimates are considered a prudent measurement of the risk in the loan portfolio and are applied to individual loans based on loan type 
based on our calculation  an allowance of million or of total loans was our estimate of probable losses within the loan portfolio as of december  this estimate resulted in a provision for loan losses on the income statement of  for if the mix and amount of future charge off percentages differ significantly from those assumptions used by management in making its determination  the allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses on the income statement could be materially affected 
results of operation net income for the period ended december  was million or per share diluted compared to million or per share diluted for the same period in the increase was primarily the result of an increase in net interest income of million and a decrease in provision for loan loss expense of  our book value per common share increased from at december  to at december  net income for generated a return on average assets of and a return on average equity of 
these compare with a return on average assets of and a return on average equity of for the period 
net income for the period ended december  was million or per share diluted compared to million or per share diluted for the same period in the increase was primarily the result of an increase in net interest income of million and a decrease in provision for loan loss expense of  our book value per common share increased from at december  to at december  net income for generated a return on average assets of and a return on average equity of 
these compare with a return on average assets of and a return on average equity of for the period 
net interest income the principal source of our revenue is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities and the interest expense on liabilities used to fund those assets  such as interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is impacted by both changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as changes in market interest rates 
net interest margin as a percent of average earning assets increased basis points to for the year ended december  compared to for the period 
an increase in short term interest rates and an increase in average earning assets improved net interest income for the periods presented 
average interest earning assets increased million for the period compared to the yield on earning assets averaged for the period compared to an average yield on earning assets of for the same period in the prime lending rate increased basis points during and the increase has favorably impacted the yield on earning assets for the year 
our cost of funds averaged for the period compared to an average cost of funds of for the same period in deposit costs have accelerated due to the re pricing of maturing certificates of deposit that roll off into certificates of deposit at currently higher interest rates as well as to our paying higher rates on our money market products 
going forward  our cost of funds is expected to increase as interest rates paid on deposit products have become increasingly competitive with the recent upward trend in interest rates 
net interest margin was also impacted during by the conversion of a fixed rate fhlb advance 
during january  we entered into a million convertible fixed rate advance with a maturity of ten years 
this advance was fixed for a period of two years 
at the end of the fixed rate term and quarterly thereafter  the fhlb had the right to convert this advance to a variable rate advance tied to the three month libor index 
upon conversion  we could prepay the advance at no penalty 
this advance  fixed at a rate of  was converted and paid off in july  at a rate of without penalty 
we replaced the borrowing with overnight short term borrowings  which averaged a rate of during the year 
these borrowings will continue to float at an overnight rate until we replace the borrowings with deposits or other fixed rate and term borrowings 
for the next several quarters  we anticipate maintaining the borrowings at a floating rate 
this floating rate will better match the variable rate commercial and commercial real estate loans in our loan portfolio and therefore reduce the volatility of net interest margin with future interest rate movements 
the net result of the above factors was an increase in net interest income of million for the year ended december  compared to the net interest margin is likely to compress in future quarters as short term interest rates peak and the cost of deposits continue to rise 
the cost of deposits typically lags behind the increase in adjustable rate loans because certificates of deposit generally mature over longer periods than immediately adjustable rate loans

change change dollars in thousands non interest income customer sevice fees on deposit accounts gain on sale of mortgage loans gain on sale of investments gain on sale of real estate held for development brokerage commissions other income growth in customer service fees on deposit accounts  our largest component of non interest income  is primarily due to growth in customer deposits  overdraft fee income on retail checking accounts and the sale of fee based products for  and we continue to increase our customer base through cross selling opportunities and marketing initiatives and promotions 
in addition  we continue to emphasize growing our checking account base to better enhance our profitability and franchise value 
we originate qualified va  khc  rhc and conventional secondary market loans and sell them into the secondary market with servicing rights released 
gain on sale of mortgage loans decreased for compared to due to a decrease in the volume of loans closed 
for  gain on sale of mortgage loans remained steady compared to we invest in various types of liquid assets  including united states treasury obligations  securities of various federal agencies  obligations of states and political subdivisions  corporate bonds  mutual funds  stocks and others 
during we did not record any gains on the sale of investments compared to  and  in recorded gains for the and periods 
gains on investment securities are infrequent in nature and are not a consistent recurring source of income 
through our subsidiary  first federal office park  we hold commercial lots adjacent to our home office on ring road in elizabethtown  that are available for sale 
during we recorded  in gains from a lot sale compared to  in gains from the sale of three properties held for development during currently  two of the original nine lots held for sale remain unsold 
other income decreased for due to decreases in trust income  write downs on real estate acquired through foreclosure and refunded loan fees 
during the fourth quarter of we made the decision to outsource our trust operations and implemented this plan during however  we still held some of these trust assets until june as of december  all trust operations have been outsourced

change change dollars in thousands non interest expenses employee compensation and benefits office occupancy expense and equipment marketing and advertising outside services and data processing bank franchise tax other expense employee compensation and benefits is the largest component of non interest expense 
compensation expense increased for due to an increase in staff needed for our continued growth and expansion as well as annual raises 
we have increased our staff in each of the last three years as we expand the products and services we offer our retail and commercial customers and increase the number and size of our branch offices 
employee compensation and benefits expense for the period also increased by  due to a change in accounting rules in which compensation expense related to stock options is recorded 
we expect a continued increase in employee compensation and benefits expense in line with recent years  as we progress with our retail expansion and market protection efforts 
office occupancy expense and equipment  marketing and advertising  and outside services and data processing increased due to additional operating expenses related to our expansion efforts during  and the two full service branch openings in contributed to higher operating costs including additional postage for promotions and direct mailings for marketing  along with increased communications and supplies expense 
we anticipate our non interest expense to continue to increase in as our retail expansion and market share efforts continue 
during the second quarter of we opened a new full service banking center in elizabethtown and began construction on a third facility in jefferson county  which we expect to open in early we are also considering other possible locations within our core market area to maintain or grow our market share 
our efficiency ratio was for compared to for the period 
analysis of financial condition total assets at december  increased to million compared to million at december   an increase of million 
the increase was primarily driven by an increase in loans of million 
the growth in loans was funded with deposits  which increased million for the period  and million in proceeds from investment securities

an increase in loan charge offs or non performing loans or an inadequate allowance for loan losses could reduce net interest income  net income and capital and limit the range of products and services we can offer 
the allowance for loan loss review committee evaluates the allowance for loan losses quarterly to maintain a level sufficient to absorb probable credit losses existing in the loan portfolio 
periodic provisions to the allowance are made as needed 
the allowance is determined based on the application of loss estimates to graded loans by categories 
the amount of the provision for loan losses necessary to maintain an adequate allowance is also based upon an analysis of such factors as changes in lending policies and procedures  underwriting standards  collection  charge off and recovery history  changes in national and local economic business conditions and developments  changes in the characteristics of the portfolio  ability and depth of lending management and staff  changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due  non accrual and classified loans  troubled debt restructuring and other loan modifications  and results of regulatory examinations

the allowance for loan losses increased  to million from december  to december  the increase in the allowance in reflected a million increase in net loans for the year  as well as a million increase in classified loans 
the provision for loan losses decreased  or to million for  compared to the decrease in the provision reflected a decrease in net charge offs of  to  during compared to  the prior year  due to lower commercial and indirect consumer loan charge offs

allowance and allocation is based on management s current evaluation of risk in each category  economic conditions  past loss experience  loan volume  past due history and other factors

the regulations provide for three categories of classified loans substandard  doubtful and loss 
a bank must establish general allowances for loan losses for any assets classified as substandard or doubtful 
if an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss  the bank must either establish specified allowances for loan losses in the amount of of the portion of the asset classified loss  or charge off the amount of the loss 
the following table provides information with respect to classified loans for the periods indicated december  dollars in thousands classified loans substandard doubtful loss total classified the million increase in substandard assets for was primarily the result of the downgrading of loans with two borrowers in the amount of a million and million  respectively 
offsetting this increase were pay offs of two classified loans having balances of  and  we remain well secured and adequately collateralized with these credits 
although we may allocate a portion of the allowance to specific loans or loan categories  the entire allowance is available for active charge offs 
we develop our allowance estimates based on actual loss experience adjusted for current economic conditions 
allowance estimates represent a prudent measurement of the risk in the loan portfolio  which we apply to individual loans based on loan type 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of certain restructured loans for which interest rate or other terms have been renegotiated  loans on which interest is no longer accrued  real estate acquired through foreclosure and repossessed assets 
we do not have any loans greater than days past due still on accrual 
loans  including impaired loans  are placed on non accrual status when they become past due days or more as to principal or interest  unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
loans are considered impaired when we no longer anticipate full principal or interest payments in accordance with the contractual loan terms 
we carry impaired loans at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is secured by collateral 
we review our loans on a regular basis and implement normal collection procedures when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan 
if the delinquency on a mortgage loan exceeds days and is not cured through normal collection procedures or an acceptable arrangement is not worked out with the borrower  we institute measures to remedy the default  including commencing a foreclosure action 
we generally charge off consumer loans when management deems a loan uncollectible and any available collateral has been liquidated 
we handle commercial business and real estate loan delinquencies on an individual basis with the advice of legal counsel 
we recognize interest income on loans on the accrual basis except for those loans in a non accrual of income status 
we discontinue accruing interest on impaired loans when management believes  after consideration of economic and business conditions and collection efforts that the borrowers financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful  typically after the loan becomes days delinquent 
when we discontinue interest accrual  we reverse existing accrued interest and subsequently recognize interest income only to the extent we receive cash payments 
we classify real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure as real estate owned until such time as it is sold 
we classify new and used automobile  motorcycle and all terrain vehicles acquired as a result of foreclosure as repossessed assets until they are sold 
when such property is acquired we record it at the lower of the unpaid principal balance of the related loan or its fair market value 
we charge any write down of the property at the time of acquisition to the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent gains and losses are included in non interest income and non interest expense

the restructured loans primarily consist of two credit relationships with balances of million and  the terms of these loans have been renegotiated to reduce the rate of interest and extend the term  thus reducing the amount of cash flow required from the borrower to service the loans 
the borrowers are currently meeting the terms of the restructured loans 
non performing assets for includes million in restructured commercial and residential mortgage loans 
the restructured loans primarily consist of two commercial relationships with balances of million and  and a  residential mortgage relationship 
investment securities interest on securities provides us our largest source of interest income after interest on loans  constituting of the total interest income for the year ended december  the securities portfolio serves as a source of liquidity and earnings and contributes to the management of interest rate risk 
we have the authority to invest in various types of liquid assets  including short term united states treasury obligations and securities of various federal agencies  obligations of states and political subdivisions  corporate bonds  certificates of deposit at insured savings and loans and banks  bankers acceptances  and federal funds 
we may also invest a portion of our assets in certain commercial paper and corporate debt securities 
we are also authorized to invest in mutual funds and stocks whose assets conform to the investments that we are authorized to make directly 
the available for sale and held to maturity investment portfolios decreased by million during the period as securities were called for redemption in accordance with their terms due to increasing rates 
during the year we made purchases of investments in state and municipal obligations and corporate bonds 
the corporate bonds re price quarterly with three month libor 
the state and municipal obligations have an average life of years 
we purchased these securities to enhance earnings and manage interest rate risk by placing assets with longer terms on the balance sheet 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the investment portfolio 
we review unrealized losses at least on a quarterly basis to determine whether the losses are other than temporary and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation 
we consider the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and our intent and ability to retain the investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
in analyzing an issuer s financial condition  we may consider whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies  whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred  and the results of reviews of the issuer s financial condition 
the unrealized losses on our investments in us treasury and agencies  mortgage backed securities and obligations of state and political subdivisions are due to interest rate increases 
because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality  and because we have the ability and intent to hold these investments until recovery of fair value  which may be maturity  we do not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  the following table provides the carrying value of our securities portfolio at the dates indicated

deposits we rely primarily on customer service and long standing relationships with customers to attract and retain deposits 
market interest rates and rates on deposit products offered by competing financial institutions can significantly affect our ability to attract and retain deposits 
we attract both short term and long term deposits from the general public by offering a wide range of deposit accounts and interest rates 
in recent years market conditions have caused us to rely increasingly on short term certificate accounts and other deposit alternatives that are more responsive to market interest rates 
we use forecasts based on interest rate risk simulations to assist management in monitoring our use of certificates of deposit and other deposit products as funding sources and the impact of the use of those products on interest income and net interest margin in various rate environments 
in conjunction with our initiatives to expand and enhance our retail branch network  we emphasize growing our customer checking account base to better enhance profitability and franchise value 
retail and commercial deposits increased million and we added million in brokered certificates of deposit for the year 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in public fund deposits  resulting in an increase in total deposits of million for the period 
the increase in retail deposits was primarily in certificate of deposit balances due to a promotion and customers moving from money market and savings products into more attractive certificate of deposit products 
to evaluate our funding needs in light of deposit trends resulting from these changing conditions  management and board committees evaluate simulated performance reports that forecast changes in margins 
we continue to offer attractive certificate rates for various terms to allow us to retain deposit customers and reduce interest rate risk during the current rate environment  while protecting the margin 
we offer a broad selection of deposit instruments  including non interest bearing checking  statement and passbook savings accounts  health savings accounts  now accounts  money market accounts and fixed and variable rate certificates with varying maturities 
we also offer tax deferred individual retirement accounts 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in interest rates and competition 
as of december   approximately of our deposits consisted of various savings and demand deposit accounts from which customers can withdraw funds at any time without penalty 
management periodically adjusts interest rates paid on our deposit products  maturity terms  service fees and withdrawal penalties 
we also offer certificates of deposit with a variety of terms  interest rates and minimum deposit requirements 
the variety of deposit accounts allows us to compete more effectively for funds and to respond with more flexibility to the flow of funds away from depository institutions into direct investment vehicles such as government and corporate securities 
however  market conditions continue to significantly affect our ability to attract and maintain deposits and our cost of funds 
the following table breaks down our deposits 
december  dollars in thousands non interest bearing now demand savings money market certificates of deposit total as of december   certificates of deposits in amounts of  or more totaled million  most of which were held by persons residing within our service areas 
an additional million of certificates of deposits in amounts of  or more were obtained from deposit brokers at december  brokered deposits consist of certificates of deposit placed by deposit brokers for a fee and can be utilized to support our asset growth 
the following table shows at december  the amount of our certificates of deposit of  or more by time remaining until maturity 
certificates maturity period of deposit in thousands three months or less three through six months six through twelve months over twelve months total short term borrowings we have the ability to obtain short term borrowings  consisting of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase at year end and we had short term borrowings of million for and million for from the fhlb of cincinnati 
these borrowings averaged a rate of for and for advances from federal home loan bank deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and for our general business purposes 
we can also use advances borrowings from the fhlb of cincinnati to compensate for reductions in deposits or deposit inflows at less than projected levels 
advances from the fhlb are secured by our stock in the fhlb  certain securities  certain commercial real estate loans and substantially all of our first mortgage loans 
at december  we had million in advances outstanding from the fhlb and the capacity to increase our borrowings an additional million 
the fhlb of cincinnati functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for savings banks and other member financial institutions 
as a member  we are required to own capital stock in the fhlb and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our home mortgages and other assets principally  securities which are obligations of  or guaranteed by  the united states provided that we meet certain creditworthiness standards 
for further information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report

the objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that we can meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  as well as our operating cash needs  at a reasonable cost  taking into account all on and off balance sheet funding demands 
we maintain an investment and funds management policy  which identifies the primary sources of liquidity  establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity  and establishes minimum liquidity requirements in compliance with regulatory guidance 
the asset liability committee continually monitors our liquidity position 
our sources of funds include the sale of securities in the available for sale portion of the investment portfolio  principal pay downs on loans and mortgage backed securities  proceeds realized from loans held for sale  brokered deposits and other wholesale funding 
we also secured federal funds borrowing lines from two of our correspondent banks of million each 
our banking centers also provide access to retail deposit markets 
if large certificate depositors shift to our competitors or other markets in response to interest rate changes  we have the ability to replenish those deposits through alternative funding sources 
traditionally  we have also borrowed from the fhlb to supplement our funding requirements 
at december   we had an unused approved line of credit in the amount of million and sufficient collateral available to borrow  approximately  an additional million in advances from the fhlb 
we believe our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet expected cash needs for the foreseeable future 
at the holding company level  the corporation uses cash to pay dividends to stockholders  repurchase common stock  make selected investments and acquisitions  and service debt 
the main sources of funding for the corporation include dividends from the bank  borrowings and access to the capital markets 
the primary source of funding for the corporation has been dividends and returns of investment from the bank 
kentucky banking laws limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to the corporation by the bank without prior approval of the kofi 
under these laws  the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year is limited to current year s net income  as defined in the laws  combined with the retained net income of the preceding two years  less any dividends declared during those periods 
at december   the bank had approximately million of retained earnings that could be used to pay dividends without prior regulatory approval 
because of these limitations  consolidated cash flows as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows may not represent cash immediately available to the corporation 
during  the bank declared and paid dividends of million to the corporation 
capital stockholders equity increased by million during  primarily due to net income earned during the year 
this increase was offset by cash dividends declared 
average stockholders equity to average assets ratio increased to at december  from at the end of during  we purchased shares of our own common stock for  during the third quarter  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of  shares from time to time if market conditions are deemed favorable 
the repurchase program will remain effective until the number of shares authorized is repurchased or until the program expires september  as of december    shares could be repurchased under the current stock repurchase program 
each of the federal bank regulatory agencies has established minimum leverage capital requirements for banks 
banks must maintain a minimum ratio of tier capital to adjusted average quarterly assets ranging from to  subject to federal bank regulatory evaluation of an organization s overall safety and soundness 
we intend to maintain a capital position that meets or exceeds the well capitalized requirements established for banks by the fdic

these amounts have fixed maturity dates 
one of these borrowings  although fixed  is subject to conversion provisions at the option of the fhlb 
the fhlb has the right to convert this advance to a variable rate or we can prepay the advance at no penalty 
there is a substantial penalty if we prepay the advance before the fhlb exercises its right 
we do not believe this advance will be converted in the near term 
the subordinated debentures  which mature march   are redeemable before the maturity date at our option on or after march  at their principal amount plus accrued interest 
the subordinated debentures are also redeemable in whole or in part from time to time  upon the occurrence of specific events defined within the trust indenture 
the interest rate on our subordinated debentures adjusts quarterly at three month libor plus 
similar debt instruments are currently being issued with spreads to three month libor that are more favorable than our spread 
if this pricing continues through march   we will likely exercise our option to redeem our outstanding subordinated debentures on or after march  we have the option to defer distributions on the subordinated debentures from time to time for a period not to exceed consecutive quarters 
lease commitments represent the total future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases 
impact of inflation changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
we have an asset and liability structure that is essentially monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
periods of high inflation are often accompanied by relatively higher interest rates  and periods of low inflation are accompanied by relatively lower interest rates 
as market interest rates rise or fall in relation to the rates earned on our loans and investments  the value of these assets decreases or increases respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management and market risk to minimize the volatility of net interest income and exposure to economic loss that may result from fluctuating interest rates  we manage our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by our asset liability committee alco 
the alco  which includes senior management representatives  has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset liability management polices 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in the net interest income as a result of market fluctuations in interest rates 
the alco  on an ongoing basis  monitors interest rate and liquidity risk in order to implement appropriate funding and balance sheet strategies 
management considers interest rate risk to be our most significant market risk 
we utilize an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
we then evaluate potential changes in market interest rates and their subsequent effects on net interest income 
the model projects the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis points 
we also incorporate assumptions based on the historical behavior of our deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates into the model 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies 
our interest sensitivity profile was liability sensitive at december   compared to an asset sensitive position at december  given a sustained basis point decrease in rates  our base net interest income would increase by an estimated 
at december  compared to a decrease of at december  given a basis point increase in interest rates our base net interest income would decrease by an estimated 
at december  compared to an increase of at december  our interest sensitivity at any point in time will be affected by a number of factors 
these factors include the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  their relative pricing schedules  market interest rates  deposit growth  loan growth  decay rates and prepayment speed assumptions 
we have been restructuring our assets in the expectation that interest rates will be stable or decrease in the futures 
as demonstrated by the december  and december  sensitivity tables  we transitioned from an asset sensitive to a liability sensitive position as compared to prior periods 
this means that our earning assets  which consist of loans and investment securities  will change in price at a slower rate than our deposits and borrowings 
therefore  if short term interest rates increase  our net interest income will decrease 
likewise  if short term interest rates decrease  our net interest income will increase 
also changing from is the anticipated degree of change 
as of december   an increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points is projected to result in less than a change in net interest income 
interest rate changes under our current balance sheet position will not have as large of impact on earnings as the balance sheet position at december   when a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates was projected to result in over a change in net interest income 
our efforts to structure funding and future liquidity needs have decreased our asset sensitivity 
from june until june  the federal open market committee increased short term interest rates 
we believe the federal open market committee may decrease short term interest rates at some point in our net interest margin and the level of net interest income would increase with a decrease in short term interest rates 
we continually monitor the effects rate changes will have on our level of net interest income  and management works to structure the maturity and pricing of loans and deposits to mitigate large swings in net interest income 
during  we made efforts to increase the level of short term deposits offering more attractive rates on short term certificates of deposits 
also  during the third quarter of  we paid off a fixed rate fhlb advance that had converted to a variable rate advance 
we replaced this borrowing with overnight short term borrowings 
in addition  the majority of the newly originated or renewed loans during and were fixed rates loans with the interest rate fixed from three to five years
