volume was up across several product lines in volume for new products penoxsulam rice herbicide and aminopyralid herbicide for range and pasture showed strong growth over sales of spinosad and methoxyfenocide insecticides rebounded from the competitive pressures of adoption of herbicide tolerant soybeans in brazil and herbicide tolerant corn in the united states led to additional volume growth of glyphosate and phenoxy herbicides  while negatively impacting sales of traditional selective herbicides 
growth in cotton  sunflower and canola seed sales more than offset lower sales of corn seed in the united states 
in addition  demand for heart healthy oils resulted in several large restaurant chains choosing to use trans fat free canola oil  an oil derived from nexera canola seed 
the decline in price was primarily driven by highly competitive industry conditions in brazil and the unfavorable impact of currency in europe at the peak of the agricultural season and in asia pacific throughout the year 
in  volume declined percent from  while prices improved percent  including the favorable impact of currency which accounted for approximately one third of the increase in prices 
volume decreased as lower insect pressure and increased use of insect resistant traits in cotton resulted in lower demand for insecticides  and challenging market conditions suppressed sales of corn and soybean herbicides 
graphic graphic ebit in was million versus million in and million in the decline in ebit in was primarily the result of lower margins due to lower prices  product mix and an increase in raw material costs

in addition  ebit in was negatively impacted by charges totaling million for restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of related to the closure of five small manufacturing facilities 
agricultural sciences outlook for agricultural sciences sales and ebit for are expected to remain at the levels achieved in volume is expected to increase slightly as sales for corn seed in the united states rebound with an increased supply of seed with multiple stacked traits 
adoption of herbicide tolerant soybeans and corn is anticipated to progress further resulting in a continued shift from traditional herbicides to nonselective herbicide sales 
price pressure from generic competition is expected to continue 
while sales are expected to decline in more mature product lines due to generic competition  the decline is expected to be offset by the development and sale of mixtures and formulations into niche market segments 
newer products such as penoxsulam  aminopyralid  widestrike insect protection for cotton  and herculex insect protection for corn are expected to continue to ramp up in sales 
demand for the company s heart healthy canola and sunflower oils continues to build momentum  which should result in increased acres planted with nexera canola and sunflower seed

volume in north america was soft in early as customers reduced the inventories built subsequent to the hurricanes when logistics were disrupted on the us gulf coast 
while volume improved somewhat in the second quarter  a significant decline in oil and natural gas prices at the end of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter resulted in a decline in volume as customers anticipated lower product prices 
volume growth in europe was modest due to the impact of planned maintenance turnarounds at the company s plants in the netherlands and germany 
ebit declined in  as higher selling prices were more than offset by higher feedstock costs and start up costs associated with a new linear low density polyethylene and specialty polymers production facility in tarragona  spain

volume in europe was also impacted by the shutdown of the company s polystyrene plant located in barry  united kingdom  late in  which reduced product availability in the region 
in asia pacific  volume improved as customers began to restock inventories and overall demand increased 
ebit declined significantly from as poor global industry supply demand balances prevented price increases from keeping pace with the increase in feedstock and energy costs

basic plastics outlook for feedstock and energy costs are expected to remain high  but somewhat less volatile during  providing support for maintaining prices and margins 
demand for polyethylene and polypropylene is expected to show continued growth  however  another challenging year is anticipated for polystyrene  with high prices impacting demand 
while feedstock costs are expected to remain high in  polyethylene margins are expected to remain near levels 
increased demand is expected to offset new industry capacity that came on line in brazil and mexico during global industry operating rates are expected to be comparable to equity earnings from equate are expected to be lower in  the result of slightly higher raw material costs and the expiration of favorable tax benefits 
polypropylene demand is expected to be comparable to margins should improve in north america and europe in as propylene costs stabilize

the company declared dividends of per share in and per share in and outlook for in  the company continued to strengthen its financial position 
despite the fourth consecutive year of double digit increases in feedstock and energy costs coupled with somewhat softer industry conditions  the diversity of dow s business and geographic portfolio  as well as strong financial performance by its joint ventures  resulted in the second highest net income in the company s history 
working capital was reduced by million  despite higher sales levels  as the company maintained working capital ratios at low levels 
capital expenditures were held below billion  million below depreciation 
these actions enabled the company to reduce total debt by billion in since  the company has reduced total debt by over billion and its ratio of debt to total capitalization from percent to percent 
the company expects to further reduce debt as a percent of total capitalization in in  the company will continue to implement its strategy to improve long term earnings growth and earnings consistency 
while macroeconomic conditions are expected to remain healthy  volatility in feedstock and energy costs adds uncertainty to the outlook 
the company will retain its financial discipline while increasing its investment in targeted growth opportunities  principally in its performance businesses and in emerging geographies 
capital expenditures are expected to increase in  but should remain at or below the level of depreciation 
these expenditures should be sufficient to maintain the safety and reliability of the company s facilities while modestly increasing capacity in selected high value businesses 
approximately billion in debt will become due in while the company has sufficient cash to meet its scheduled debt obligations in  the company will either use a portion of its cash and cash equivalents to repay this debt as scheduled or issue new debt

asbestos related matters of union carbide corporation union carbide corporation union carbide  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  and a former union carbide subsidiary  amchem products  inc amchem  are and have been involved in a large number of asbestos related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past three decades 
based on a study completed by analysis  research planning corporation arpc in january  union carbide increased its december  asbestos related liability for pending and future claims for the year period ending in to billion  excluding future defense and processing costs 
union carbide also increased the receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability to billion at december  since then  union carbide has compared current asbestos claim and resolution activity to the results of the most recent arpc study at each balance sheet date to determine whether the accrual continues to be appropriate 
in november  union carbide requested arpc to review union carbide s historical asbestos claim and resolution activity and determine the appropriateness of updating its january study 
in january  arpc provided union carbide with a report summarizing the results of its study 
based on the low end of the range in the january study  union carbide s recorded asbestos related liability for pending and future claims at december  would be sufficient to resolve asbestos related claims against union carbide and amchem into in november  union carbide requested arpc to review union carbide s asbestos claim and resolution activity and determine the appropriateness of updating its january study 
in response to that request  arpc reviewed and analyzed data through october  in january  arpc stated that an update of its study would not provide a more likely estimate of future events than the estimate reflected in its study of the previous year and  therefore  the estimate in that study remained applicable 
based on union carbide s own review of the asbestos claim and resolution activity and arpc s response  union carbide determined that no change to the accrual was required 
at december   the recorded asbestos related liability for pending and future claims was billion 
in november  union carbide requested arpc to review union carbide s historical asbestos claim and resolution activity and determine the appropriateness of updating its january study 
in response to that request  arpc reviewed and analyzed data through october  and concluded that the experience from through was sufficient for the purpose of forecasting future filings and values of asbestos claims filed against union carbide and amchem  and could be used in place of previous assumptions to update its january study 
the resulting study  completed by arpc in december  stated that the undiscounted cost of resolving pending and future asbestos related claims against union carbide and amchem  excluding future defense and processing costs  through was estimated to be between approximately billion and billion 
as in its january study  arpc provided estimates for a longer period of time in its december study  but also reaffirmed its prior advice that forecasts for shorter periods of time are more accurate than those for longer periods of time 
based on arpc s december study and union carbide s own review of the asbestos claim and resolution activity  union carbide decreased its asbestos related liability for pending and future claims to billion at december  which will now cover the year period ending in excluding future defense and processing costs 
the reduction was million and is shown as asbestos related credit in the consolidated statements of income 
union carbide s receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability was million at december  and million at december  in addition  union carbide had receivables for insurance recoveries of million at december  and million at december   for defense and resolution costs 
the amounts recorded by union carbide for the asbestos related liability and related insurance receivable were based upon current  known facts 
however  future events  such as the number of new claims to be filed and or received each year  the average cost of disposing of each such claim  coverage issues among insurers  and the continuing solvency of various insurance companies  as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation in the united states  could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries for union carbide to be higher or lower than those projected or those recorded

environmental matters the company determines the costs of environmental remediation of its facilities and formerly owned facilities based on evaluations of current law and existing technologies 
inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions  changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability  and evolving technologies 
the recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress  or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 
in the case of landfills and other active waste management facilities  dow recognizes the costs over the useful life of the facility 
at december   the company had accrued obligations of million for environmental remediation and restoration costs  including million for the remediation of superfund sites 
this is management s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the company has accrued liabilities  although the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to twice that amount 
the company had accrued obligations of million at december   for environmental remediation and restoration costs  including million for the remediation of superfund sites 
for further discussion  see environmental matters in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and notes a and j to the consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets  discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled at december   rate of increase in future compensation levels  mortality rates and health care cost trend rates 
these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note l to the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with us gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 
the us pension plans represent approximately percent of the company s pension plan assets and obligations 
the following information relates to the us plans only  a similar approach is used for the company s non us plans 
the company determined the expected long term rate of return on assets by performing a detailed analysis of historical and expected returns based on the strategic asset allocation approved by the board of directors and the underlying return fundamentals of each asset class 
the company s historical experience with the pension fund asset performance was also considered 
the long term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for was percent 
this assumption was changed to percent for determining net periodic pension expense 
the company s historical actual return averaged percent for the ten year period ending december  the actual rate of return in was percent 
future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the company s pension plans 
a basis point adjustment in the long term return on assets assumption would change the company s total pension expense for by approximately million 
the discount rates utilized to measure the pension and other postretirement obligations of the us qualified plans are based on the yield on high quality fixed income investments at the measurement date 
future expected actuarially determined cash flows of dow s major us plans are matched against the citigroup pension discount curve above median to arrive at a single discount rate by plan 
the resulting discount rate increased from percent at december  to percent at december  a basis point adjustment in the discount rate assumption would change the company s total pension expense for by approximately million  with an immaterial change to other postretirement benefit expense due to defined dollar limits caps 
the value of the us qualified plan assets increased from billion at december  to billion at december  the company made contributions of million to the us qualified plans in the favorable impact of the contributions combined with the asset returns and an increase in the assumed discount rate  resulted in an improvement in the funded status of billion from december  to december  at december   the us qualified plans were overfunded on a projected benefit obligation basis by million 
for  the company maintained its assumption of percent for the long term rate of increase in compensation levels for the principal us qualified plans 
since  the company has used a generational mortality table to determine the duration of its pension and other postretirement obligations 
the following discussion relates to all of the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the company bases the determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of plan assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of plan assets and the actual return based on the market value of plan assets 
since the market related value of plan assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of plan assets will be impacted when previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
over the life of the plan  both gains and losses have been recognized and amortized 
at december   net gains of million remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of plan assets 
these net gains will result in decreases in future pension expense as they are recognized in the market related value of assets and are a component of the total net loss of  million shown under amounts recognized in aoci pretax in the table entitled change in projected benefit obligations  plan assets and funded status of all significant plans included in note l to the consolidated financial statements 
the other  million of net losses represents cumulative changes in plan experience and actuarial assumptions 
the net increase in the market related value of assets due to the recognition of prior gains and losses is presented in the following table net increase in market related asset value due to recognition of prior asset gains and losses in millions total based on the revised pension assumptions and changes in the market related value of assets due to the recognition of prior asset gains  the company expects to reduce expense by approximately million for all pension and other postretirement benefits in compared with income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
based on the evaluation of available evidence  both positive and negative  the company recognizes future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards  to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not 
at december   the company had a net deferred tax asset balance of billion  after valuation allowances of million 
in evaluating the ability to realize the deferred tax assets  the company relies principally on forecasted taxable income using historical and projected future operating results  the reversal of existing temporary differences and the availability of tax planning strategies 
at december   the company had deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of billion  million of which is subject to expiration in the years in order to realize these deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards  the company needs taxable income of approximately billion across multiple jurisdictions 
the taxable income needed to realize the deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards that are subject to expiration between is approximately million 
the company accrues for tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated  based on past experience 
the tax contingency reserve is adjusted for changes in circumstances and additional uncertainties  such as significant amendments to existing tax law 
at december   the company had a tax contingency reserve for both domestic and foreign issues of million

to meet the company s public commitments  as well as the stringent laws and government regulations related to environmental protection and remediation to which its global operations are subject  dow has well defined policies  requirements and management systems 
dow s eh s management system ems defines the who  what  when and how needed for the businesses to achieve the company s policies  requirements  performance objectives  leadership expectations and public commitments 
ems is also designed to minimize the long term cost of environmental protection and to comply with these laws and regulations 
in and  the security aspects of dow s ems were strengthened to require that site vulnerability assessments be conducted to ensure appropriate safeguards to protect dow s employees and physical assets in a post world 
furthermore  to ensure effective utilization  the ems is integrated into a company wide management system for eh s  operations  quality and human resources 
it is dow s policy to adhere to a waste management hierarchy that minimizes the impact of wastes and emissions on the environment 
first  dow works to eliminate or minimize the generation of waste and emissions at the source through research  process design  plant operations and maintenance 
second  dow finds ways to reuse and recycle materials 
finally  unusable or non recyclable hazardous waste is treated before disposal to eliminate or reduce the hazardous nature and volume of the waste 
treatment may include destruction by chemical  physical  biological or thermal means 
disposal of waste materials in landfills is considered only after all other options have been thoroughly evaluated 
dow has specific requirements for waste that is transferred to non dow facilities  including the periodic auditing of these facilities 
dow believes third party verification is a cornerstone of world class eh s performance and building public trust 
numerous dow sites in europe  latin america  australia and north america have received third party verification of dow s compliance with responsible care and with outside specifications such as iso additional sites will receive third party auditing over the next two years in support of new industry wide responsible care expectations and the release of the responsible care global charter 
during  a third party auditor verified that dow s operating discipline management system odms is compliant with multiple external standards iso  iso  iso ts and ohsas 
dow s eh s policies helped the company achieve excellent safety performance in dow demonstrated continuous improvement in reducing its personal injury and illness osha occupational safety and health administration rate and dow s newly introduced safety severity index 
tragically  there were two employee fatalities during that resulted from injuries sustained from elevated falls 
in one case  the employee passed away in from injuries sustained in late the company posted a significant reduction in leaks  breaks and spills  and notices of violation from environmental regulatory agencies in improvement in environmental compliance remains a top management priority  with initiatives underway to further improve compliance in chemical security growing public and political attention has been placed on protecting critical infrastructure  including the chemical industry  from security threats 
terrorist attacks and natural disasters have increased concern about the security of chemical production and distribution 
in response to the increasing call by many  including dow and the american chemistry council  for uniform performance based national standards for securing the us chemical industry  us chemical plant security legislation and port security legislation were passed and draft plant and transportation security regulations were proposed in the focus on security is not new to dow 
a comprehensive  multi level security plan for the company has been maintained since this plan was activated in response to the events of dow continues to improve its security plans  placing emphasis on the safety of dow communities and people by being prepared to meet risks at any level and to address both internal and external identifiable risks 
dow s security plans also are developed to avert interruptions of normal business work operations which could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
dow uses a risk based approach employing the us government s sandia national labs methodology to repeatedly assess the risks to sites  systems  and processes 
the comprehensive distribution risk review process that has been in place for decades was expanded to address potential threats in all modes of transportation across the company s supply chain 
to reduce vulnerabilities  dow maintains security measures that meet or exceed regulatory and industry security standards in all areas in which the company operates 
dow played a key role in the development and implementation of the american chemistry council s responsible care security code that requires all aspects of security including facility  transportation  and cyberspace be assessed and gaps addressed 
through the company s global implementation of the security code  dow has permanently heightened the level of security not just in the united states  but worldwide 
dow employs approximately employees and contractors in its emergency services and security department worldwide 
dow committed over million in capital over a ten year period for plant security  supply chain and cyberspace security enhancements  regulatory compliance and response capabilities as well as other components of dow s security program 
these costs are not considered material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
dow continually works to strengthen partnerships with local responders  law enforcement  and security agencies  and to enhance confidence in the integrity of the company s security and risk management program  as well as strengthen its preparedness and response capabilities 
dow also works closely with its supply chain partners and strives to educate lawmakers  regulators and communities about the company s resolve and actions to date which are mitigating security and crisis threats 
climate change there is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases ghg due to human activities continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting the climate 
political debates continue about how to implement fair and effective ghg mitigation efforts 
dow takes global climate change very seriously and is not waiting for the resolution of the debate 
dow is committed to reducing its ghg intensity pounds of ghg per pound of product  developing climate friendly products and processes and  over the longer term  implementing technology solutions to achieve even greater climate change improvements 
since  dow has reduced ghg direct emission intensity by over percent and has achieved a percent improvement in energy intensity the amount of energy required to produce one pound of product 
in doing so  it has avoided consuming more than trillion btus  a savings that when converted to electricity would be more than sufficient to supply the electricity consumed by residential users in the state of california for one year 
this trend could reverse  however  depending on business growth  capacity utilization and the pace of new technology development 
dow also contributes to the climate change solution by producing products that help others reduce ghg emissions  such as lightweight plastics for automobiles and insulation for energy efficient homes and appliances 
dow has demonstrated its commitment to technological innovation and conservation though its exploration of renewable energy sources 
in february  dow and general motors announced the start up of a joint project to prove the viability of hydrogen fuel cells for large industrial power systems  using hydrogen from the company s production processes at its freeport  texas  facility 
this project is still underway 
dow has established several new teams to manage the challenges and opportunities associated with this priority issue 
the new teams will lead the development of a cohesive global climate change strategy and develop new ghg emission reduction projects 
gains made toward dow s energy efficiency goal will directly impact progress in meeting its climate change goal 
dow is studying the lifecycle impact of its products on climate change and additional global projects that could offset our overall ghg emissions through carbon dioxide reduction 
a new climate change energy policy strategy board has also been chartered to ensure that dow s efforts are on target to address the long term challenge of global warming and contribute to the world s solution to this critical issue 
environmental remediation dow accrues the costs of remediation of its facilities and formerly owned facilities based on current law and existing technologies 
the nature of such remediation includes  for example  the management of soil and groundwater contamination and the closure of contaminated landfills and other waste management facilities 
in the case of landfills and other active waste management facilities  dow recognizes the costs over the useful life of the facility 
the accounting policies adopted to properly reflect the monetary impacts of environmental matters are discussed in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
to assess the impact on the financial statements  environmental experts review currently available facts to evaluate the probability and scope of potential liabilities 
inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions  changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability  and evolving technologies 
these liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 
dow had an accrued liability of million at december   related to the remediation of current or former dow owned sites 
the liability related to remediation at december  was million 
in addition to current and former dow owned sites  under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and equivalent state laws hereafter referred to collectively as superfund law  dow is liable for remediation of other hazardous waste sites where dow allegedly disposed of  or arranged for the treatment or disposal of  hazardous substances 
dow readily cooperates in the remediation of these sites where the company s liability is clear  thereby minimizing legal and administrative costs 
because superfund law imposes joint and several liability upon each party at a site  dow has evaluated its potential liability in light of the number of other companies that also have been named potentially responsible parties prps at each site  the estimated apportionment of costs among all prps  and the financial ability and commitment of each to pay its expected share 
the company s remaining liability for the remediation of superfund sites at december  was million million at december  
the company has not recorded any third party recovery related to these sites as a receivable 
information regarding environmental sites is provided below environmental sites dow owned sites superfund sites number of sites at january sites added during year sites closed during year number of sites at december dow owned sites are sites currently or formerly owned by dow  where remediation obligations are imposed in the united states by the resource conservation recovery act or analogous state law 
of these sites were formerly owned by dowell schlumberger  inc  a group of companies in which the company previously owned a percent interest 
dow sold its interest in dowell schlumberger in superfund sites are sites  including sites not owned by dow  where remediation obligations are imposed by superfund law 
the company s manufacturing sites in freeport  texas  and midland  michigan  are the sites for which the company has the largest environmental remediation accruals 
from the start of operations at the freeport site in the s until the mid s  manufacturing wastes were typically placed in on site pits and landfills 
the resulting soil and groundwater contamination is being assessed and remediated under the provisions of the resource conservation recovery act rcra  in concert with the state of texas 
at december   the company had an accrual of million million at december  related to environmental remediation at the freeport manufacturing site 
in  million million in was spent on environmental remediation at the freeport site 
similar to the freeport site  in the early days of operations at the midland site  manufacturing wastes were usually disposed of on site  resulting in soil and groundwater contamination  which has been contained and managed on site under a series of rcra permits and regulatory agreements 
the most recent hazardous waste operating license for the midland site  issued in  also included provisions for the company to conduct an investigation to determine the nature and extent of off site contamination from historic midland site operations 
the scope of the investigation includes midland area soils  tittabawassee and saginaw river sediment and floodplain soils  and saginaw bay and requires the company to conduct interim response actions 
see note j to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
at december   the company had an accrual of million million at december  for environmental remediation and investigation associated with the midland site 
in  the company spent million million in on environmental remediation at the midland site 
in total  the company s accrued liability for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs was million at december   compared with million at the end of this is management s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the company has accrued liabilities  although the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to twice that amount 
it is the opinion of the company s management that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of those disclosed will have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to environmental remediation totaled million in  million in and million in capital expenditures for environmental protection were million in  million in and million in asbestos related matters of union carbide corporation introduction union carbide corporation union carbide  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past three decades 
these suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages 
the alleged claims primarily relate to products that union carbide sold in the past  alleged exposure to asbestos containing products located on union carbide s premises  and union carbide s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former union carbide subsidiary  amchem products  inc amchem 
in many cases  plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure  or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from exposure to union carbide s products 
influenced by the bankruptcy filings of numerous defendants in asbestos related litigation and the prospects of various forms of state and national legislative reform  the rate at which plaintiffs filed asbestos related suits against various companies  including union carbide and amchem  increased in  and the first half of since then  the rate of filing has significantly abated 
union carbide expects more asbestos related suits to be filed against union carbide and amchem in the future  and will aggressively defend or reasonably resolve  as appropriate  both pending and future claims 
the table below provides information regarding asbestos related claims filed against union carbide and amchem claims unresolved at january    claims filed    claims settled  dismissed or otherwise resolved   claims unresolved at december    claimants with claims against both ucc and amchem   individual claimants at december    plaintiffs lawyers often sue dozens or even hundreds of defendants in individual lawsuits on behalf of hundreds or even thousands of claimants 
as a result  the damages alleged are not expressly identified as to union carbide  amchem or any other particular defendant  even when specific damages are alleged with respect to a specific disease or injury 
in fact  there are no personal injury cases in which only union carbide and or amchem are the sole named defendants 
for these reasons and based upon union carbide s litigation and settlement experience  union carbide does not consider the damages alleged against union carbide and amchem to be a meaningful factor in its determination of any potential asbestos liability 
estimating the liability based on a study completed by analysis  research planning corporation arpc in january  union carbide increased its december  asbestos related liability for pending and future claims for the year period ending in to billion  excluding future defense and processing costs 
since then  union carbide has compared current asbestos claim and resolution activity to the results of the most recent arpc study at each balance sheet date to determine whether the accrual continues to be appropriate 
in november  union carbide requested arpc to review union carbide s historical asbestos claim and resolution activity and determine the appropriateness of updating its january study 
in january  arpc provided union carbide with a report summarizing the results of its study 
at december   union carbide s recorded asbestos related liability for pending and future claims was billion 
based on the low end of the range in the january study  union carbide s recorded asbestos related liability for pending and future claims at december  would be sufficient to resolve asbestos related claims against union carbide and amchem into as in its january study  arpc did provide estimates for a longer period of time in its january study  but also reaffirmed its prior advice that forecasts for shorter periods of time are more accurate than those for longer periods of time 
in november  union carbide requested arpc to review union carbide s asbestos claim and resolution activity and determine the appropriateness of updating its january study 
in response to that request  arpc reviewed and analyzed data through october  in january  arpc stated that an update of its study would not provide a more likely estimate of future events than the estimate reflected in its study of the previous year and  therefore  the estimate in that study remained applicable 
based on union carbide s own review of the asbestos claim and resolution activity and arpc s response  union carbide determined that no change to the accrual was required 
at december   union carbide s asbestos related liability for pending and future claims was billion 
in november  union carbide requested arpc to review union carbide s historical asbestos claim and resolution activity and determine the appropriateness of updating its january study 
in response to that request  arpc reviewed and analyzed data through october  and concluded that the experience from through was sufficient for the purpose of forecasting future filings and values of asbestos claims filed against union carbide and amchem  and could be used in place of previous assumptions to update its january study 
the resulting study  completed by arpc in december  stated that the undiscounted cost of resolving pending and future asbestos related claims against union carbide and amchem  excluding future defense and processing costs  through was estimated to be between approximately billion and billion 
as in its january study  arpc provided estimates for a longer period of time in its december study  but also reaffirmed its prior advice that forecasts for shorter periods of time are more accurate than those for longer periods of time 
based on arpc s december study and union carbide s own review of the asbestos claim and resolution activity  union carbide decreased its asbestos related liability for pending and future claims to billion at december  which will now cover the year period ending in excluding future defense and processing costs 
the reduction was million and is shown as asbestos related credit in the consolidated statements of income 
at december   approximately percent of the recorded liability related to pending claims and approximately percent related to future claims 
at december   approximately percent of the recorded liability related to pending claims and approximately percent related to future claims 
defense and resolution costs the following table provides information regarding defense and resolution costs related to asbestos related claims filed against union carbide and amchem defense and resolution costs aggregate costs to date as of in millions dec 
 defense costs resolution costs  the average resolution payment per asbestos claimant and the rate of new claim filings has fluctuated both up and down since the beginning of union carbide s management expects such fluctuations to continue in the future based upon a number of factors  including the number and type of claims settled in a particular period  the jurisdictions in which such claims arose  and the extent to which any proposed legislative reform related to asbestos litigation is being considered 
union carbide expenses defense costs as incurred 
the pretax impact for defense and resolution costs  net of insurance  was million in  million in and million in  and was reflected in cost of sales 
insurance receivables at december   union carbide increased the receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability to billion  substantially exhausting its asbestos product liability coverage 
the insurance receivable related to the asbestos liability was determined by union carbide after a thorough review of applicable insurance policies and the wellington agreement  to which union carbide and many of its liability insurers are signatory parties  as well as other insurance settlements  with due consideration given to applicable deductibles  retentions and policy limits  and taking into account the solvency and historical payment experience of various insurance carriers 
the wellington agreement and other agreements with insurers are designed to facilitate an orderly resolution and collection of union carbide s insurance policies and to resolve issues that the insurance carriers may raise 
asbestos related matters of union carbide corporation continued in september  union carbide filed a comprehensive insurance coverage case  now proceeding in the supreme court of the state of new york  county of new york  seeking to confirm its rights to insurance for various asbestos claims and to facilitate an orderly and timely collection of insurance proceeds 
this lawsuit was filed against insurers that are not signatories to the wellington agreement and or do not otherwise have agreements in place with union carbide regarding their asbestos related insurance coverage  in order to facilitate an orderly resolution and collection of such insurance policies and to resolve issues that the insurance carriers may raise 
although the lawsuit is continuing  through the end of  union carbide reached settlements with several of the carriers involved in this litigation 
union carbide s receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability was million at december  and million at december  at december   all of the receivable for insurance recoveries million at december  was related to insurers that are not signatories to the wellington agreement and or do not otherwise have agreements in place regarding their asbestos related insurance coverage 
in addition to the receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability  union carbide had receivables for defense and resolution costs submitted to insurance carriers for reimbursement as follows receivables for costs submitted to insurance carriers at december in millions receivables for defense costs receivables for resolution costs total after a review of its insurance policies  with due consideration given to applicable deductibles  retentions and policy limits  after taking into account the solvency and historical payment experience of various insurance carriers  existing insurance settlements  and the advice of outside counsel with respect to the applicable insurance coverage law relating to the terms and conditions of its insurance policies  union carbide continues to believe that its recorded receivable for insurance recoveries from all insurance carriers is probable of collection 
summary the amounts recorded by union carbide for the asbestos related liability and related insurance receivable described above were based upon current  known facts 
however  future events  such as the number of new claims to be filed and or received each year  the average cost of disposing of each such claim  coverage issues among insurers  and the continuing solvency of various insurance companies  as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation in the united states  could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries for union carbide to be higher or lower than those projected or those recorded 
because of the uncertainties described above  union carbide s management cannot estimate the full range of the cost of resolving pending and future asbestos related claims facing union carbide and amchem 
union carbide s management believes that it is reasonably possible that the cost of disposing of union carbide s asbestos related claims  including future defense costs  could have a material adverse impact on union carbide s results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the consolidated financial position of union carbide 
it is the opinion of dow s management that it is reasonably possible that the cost of union carbide disposing of its asbestos related claims  including future defense costs  could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the consolidated financial position of the company 
the dow chemical company and subsidiaries part ii  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dow s business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices 
to manage such risks effectively  the company enters into hedging transactions  pursuant to established guidelines and policies  which enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of financial market risk 
derivatives used for this purpose are designated as hedges per sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  where appropriate 
a secondary objective is to add value by creating additional non specific exposure within established limits and policies  derivatives used for this purpose are not designated as hedges per sfas no 
the potential impact of creating such additional exposures is not material to the company s results 
the global nature of dow s business requires active participation in the foreign exchange markets 
as a result of investments  production facilities and other operations on a global basis  the company has assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the us dollar 
the primary objective of the company s foreign exchange risk management is to optimize the us dollar value of net assets and cash flows  keeping the adverse impact of currency movements to a minimum 
to achieve this objective  the company hedges on a net exposure basis using foreign currency forward contracts  over the counter option contracts  cross currency swaps  and nonderivative instruments in foreign currencies 
main exposures are related to assets and liabilities denominated in the currencies of europe  asia pacific and canada  bonds denominated in foreign currencies mainly the euro  and economic exposure derived from the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the us dollar value of future cash flows 
the majority of the foreign exchange exposure is related to european currencies and the japanese yen 
the main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the total funding cost to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile 
dow uses interest rate swaps  swaptions  and exchange traded instruments to accomplish this objective 
the company s primary exposure is to the us dollar yield curve 
dow has a portfolio of equity securities derived from its acquisition and divestiture activity 
this exposure is managed in a manner consistent with the company s market risk policies and procedures 
inherent in dow s business is exposure to price changes for several commodities 
some exposures can be hedged effectively through liquid tradable financial instruments 
feedstocks for ethylene production and natural gas constitute the main commodity exposures 
over the counter and exchange traded instruments are used to hedge these risks when feasible 
dow uses value at risk var  stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes 
var estimates the potential gain or loss in fair market values  given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time  using specified confidence levels 
on an ongoing basis  the company estimates the maximum gain or loss that could arise in one day  given a two standard deviation movement in the respective price levels 
these amounts are relatively insignificant in comparison to the size of the equity of the company 
the var methodology used by dow is based primarily on a variance covariance statistical model
