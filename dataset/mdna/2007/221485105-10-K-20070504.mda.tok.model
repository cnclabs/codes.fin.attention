inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its financial condition and results of operations during the past three fiscal years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 

table of contents quarterly results and seasonality the following tables set forth the company s unaudited quarterly operating results for the eight most recent quarterly periods 
the financial information gives effect to the restatement discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in thousands  except per share data and number of stores fiscal quarters ended april  july  october  february  as restated as restated as restated net sales gross profit net income loss net income loss per weighted average share basic diluted number of stores open at end of period fiscal quarters ended in thousands  except per share data and number of stores april  july  october  january  as restated as restated as restated as restated net sales gross profit net income loss net income loss per weighted average share basic diluted number of stores open at end of period the three months ended february  was a fourteen week period as compared to the three months ended january  which was a thirteen week period 
the company s business is highly seasonal  reflecting the general pattern associated with the retail industry of peak sales and earnings during the fourth quarter holiday season 
due to the importance of the holiday selling season  the fourth quarter of each fiscal year has historically contributed  and the company expects it will continue to contribute  a disproportionate percentage of the company s net sales and most of its net income for the entire fiscal year 
any factors negatively affecting the company during the holiday selling season in any year  including unfavorable economic conditions  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company generally experiences lower sales and earnings during the first three quarters and  as is typical in the retail industry  may incur losses in these quarters 
the results of operations for these interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full fiscal year 
in addition  the company makes decisions regarding merchandise well in advance of the season in which it will be sold 
significant deviations from projected demand for products could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations  either by lost gross sales due to insufficient inventory or lost gross margin due to the need to mark down excess inventory 
the company s quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate based upon such factors as delays in the flow of merchandise  the ability to realize the expected operational and cost efficiencies from its distribution centers  the number and timing of store openings and related store preopening expenses  the amount of net sales contributed by new and existing stores  the mix of products sold  the timing and level of markdowns  store closings or relocations  competitive factors  changes in fuel and other shipping costs  general economic conditions  geopolitical conditions  fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies  labor market fluctuations  changes in accounting rules and regulations and unseasonable weather conditions 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates cost plus  inc s and its subsidiaries discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  inventory values  fixed asset lives  intangible asset values  deferred income taxes  self insurance reserves and the impact of contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company has also chosen certain accounting policies when options are available  including the retail inventory method of accounting for inventories and  prior to fiscal  the intrinsic value method to account for common stock options 
these accounting policies are applied consistently for all years presented except for the adoption of sfas r as of january  operating results would be affected if other alternatives were used 
information about the impact on operating results by using accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  as it relates to fiscal  is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
although not all inclusive  the company believes that the following represent the more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from the sale of merchandise either at the point of sale in its stores or at the time of receipt by the customer for merchandise purchased from its website 
revenue from sales of gift cards is deferred until redemption or until the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote gift card breakage 
income from gift card breakage is recorded as a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses 
shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue at the time the merchandise is delivered to the customer 
the company s revenues are reported net of discounts and returns  including an allowance for estimated returns 
the allowance for sales returns is based on historical experience and was approximately million at the end of fiscal and million at the end of fiscal and inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the retail inventory method rim  in which the valuation of inventories at cost and gross margins is calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
the company s use of the rim results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market as markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markon  markdowns and shrinkage  which impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as gross margin 
the company s rim utilizes multiple departments in which fairly homogeneous classes of merchandise inventories having similar gross margins are grouped 
management believes that the company s rim provides an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
inventory costs also include certain buying and distribution costs related to the procurement  processing and transportation of merchandise 
other accounting estimates estimates inherent in the preparation of the company s financial statements include those associated with the evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets  the adequacy of tax contingencies  the impairment of goodwill and long lived assets and those estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to litigation  claims and assessments 
the company assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized in the future  and records a valuation allowance  if necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
the company also records reserves for estimates of probable settlements of income tax audits 

table of contents to the extent that estimates of probable settlements change or final tax outcomes are different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made 
the company s effective tax rate may be materially impacted by changes in the estimated level of earnings  changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance or changes in the expected outcome of audits 
the company does not currently have a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets 
the company performs an impairment test of goodwill annually or earlier if conditions indicate an earlier review is necessary 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  goodwill is impaired and will be written down to its estimated fair value 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill using a market value approach and concluded that its goodwill was impaired 
accordingly  the company recognized a non cash impairment charge of million in fiscal to write down all of the goodwill on its consolidated balance sheet 
the company s goodwill of million represented the difference between the purchase price and the related underlying tangible and identifiable intangible net asset values resulting from the acquisition of cost plus  inc by bc investments  inc in november the company is involved in litigation  claims and assessments incidental to its business  the disposition of which is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company s assumptions related to these matters 
the company accrues its best estimate of the probable cost for the resolution of claims 
when appropriate  such estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling the matters and are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
to the extent additional information arises or the company s strategies change  it is possible that the company s best estimate of its probable liability may change 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the company does not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk the interest payable on the company s bank lines of credit are based on variable interest rates and therefore are affected by changes in market interest rates 
in addition  the company has fixed and variable income investments classified as cash and cash equivalents which are also affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on existing variable rate debt were to rise basis points a change from the company s borrowing rate as of february   the company s results of operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
foreign currency risks the majority of purchase obligations outside of the united states of america into which the company enters are settled in us dollars  therefore  the company has only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
the cost of products purchased in international markets can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and significant exchange rate changes could have a material impact on future product costs 
the extent to which an increase in costs from foreign currency exchange rate changes will be able to be recovered in higher prices charged to customers is uncertain 
the company does not hedge against foreign currency risks
