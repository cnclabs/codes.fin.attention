key earnings drivers for the company over the next five years will be additions to utility rate base at south carolina electric gas company sce g and public service company of north carolina  incorporated psnc energy  consisting primarily of capital expenditures for environmental facilities  new generating capacity and system expansion 
other factors that will impact future earnings growth include the regulatory environment  customer growth in each of the regulated utility businesses  consistent earnings growth in the natural gas marketing business in georgia and controlling the growth of operation and maintenance expenses 
electric operations the electric operations segment is comprised of the electric operations of sce g  south carolina generating company  inc genco and south carolina fuel company  inc fuel company  and is primarily engaged in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity in south carolina 
at december  sce g provided electricity to  customers in an area covering nearly  square miles 
genco owns and operates a coal fired generation station and sells electricity solely to sce g 
fuel company acquires  owns and provides financing for sce g s nuclear fuel  fossil fuel and emission allowance requirements 
operating results for electric operations are primarily driven by customer demand for electricity  the ability to control costs and rates allowed to be charged to customers 
embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity 
sce g s allowed return on equity is not to exceed  with rates set at 
demand for electricity is primarily affected by weather  customer growth and the economy 
sce g is able to recover the cost of fuel used in electric generation through retail customers bills  but increases in fuel costs affect electric prices and  therefore  the competitive position of electricity against other energy sources 
legislative and regulatory initiatives  including the energy policy act of the energy policy act also could significantly impact the results of operations and cash flows for the electric operations segment 
the energy policy act became law in august  and it provides  among other things  for the establishment of an electric reliability organization ero to propose and enforce mandatory reliability standards for transmission systems  for procedures governing enforcement actions by the ero and ferc and for procedures under which the ero may delegate authority to a regional entity to enforce reliability standards 
in february ferc issued final rules to implement the electric reliability provisions of the energy policy act 
the company is reviewing these rules and monitoring their implementation to determine the impact they may have on sce g s access to or cost of power for its native load customers and for its marketing of power outside its service territory 
the company cannot predict when or if ferc will advance other regulatory initiatives related to the national energy market or what conditions such initiatives would impose on utilities 
new legislation may also impose stringent requirements on power plants to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide  nitrogen oxides and mercury 
it is also possible that new initiatives will be introduced to reduce carbon dioxide emissions 
the company cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted  and if it is  the conditions it would impose on utilities 
gas distribution the gas distribution segment is comprised of the local distribution operations of sce g and psnc energy  and is primarily engaged in the purchase  transmission and sale of natural gas to retail customers in portions of north carolina and south carolina 
at december  this segment provided natural gas to  customers in areas covering  square miles 
operating results for gas distribution are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas  the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers 
embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity 
demand for natural gas is primarily affected by weather  customer growth  the economy and  for commercial and industrial customers  the availability and price of alternate fuels 
natural gas competes with electricity  propane and heating oil to serve the heating and  to a lesser extent  other household energy needs of residential and small commercial customers 
this competition is generally based on price and convenience 
large commercial and industrial customers often have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel  such as propane or fuel oil 
natural gas competes with these alternate fuels based on price 
as a result  any significant disparity between supply and demand  either of natural gas or of alternate fuels  and due either to production or delivery disruptions or other factors  will affect price and impact the company s ability to retain large commercial and industrial customers 
significant supply disruptions did occur in september and october as a result of hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico  resulting in the curtailment during the period of most large commercial and industrial customers with interruptible supply agreements 
while supply disruptions were not experienced in or in january or february of  the price of natural gas remains volatile and has resulted in short term competitive pressure 
the long term impact of volatile gas prices and gas supply has not been determined 
gas transmission effective november   scg pipeline merged into scpc  and the merged company changed its name to carolina gas transmission corporation cgtc 
cgtc operates an open access  transportation only interstate pipeline company regulated by ferc 
cgtc s operating results are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas  the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers 
demand for cgtc s services is closely linked to demand for natural gas and is affected by the price of alternate fuels and customer growth 
cgtc provides transportation services to sce g for its gas distribution customers and for certain electric generation needs and to scana energy marketing  inc semi for natural gas marketing 
cgtc also provides transportation services to other natural gas utilities  municipalities and county gas authorities and to industrial customers 
prior to the merger  the gas transmission segment was comprised solely of scpc  which owned and operated an intrastate pipeline engaged in the purchase  transmission and sale of natural gas on a wholesale basis to distribution companies including sce g and industrial customers throughout most of south carolina 
scpc s operating results were primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas  the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers 
retail gas marketing scana energy  a division of semi  comprises the retail gas marketing segment 
this segment markets natural gas to over  customers as of december  throughout georgia 
scana energy s total customer base represents over a share of the approximately million customers in georgia s deregulated natural gas market 
scana energy remains the second largest natural gas marketer in the state 
scana energy s competitors include affiliates of other large energy companies with experience in georgia s energy market as well as several electric membership cooperatives 
scana energy s ability to maintain its market share depends on the prices it charges customers relative to the prices charged by its competitors  its ability to continue to provide high levels of customer service and other factors 
in addition  the pipeline capacity available for energy marketing to serve industrial and other customers is tied to the market share held by scana energy in the retail market 
as georgia s regulated provider  scana energy serves low income customers and customers unable to obtain or maintain natural gas service from other marketers at rates approved by the georgia public service commission gpsc  and it receives funding from the universal service fund for some of the bad debt associated with the low income group 
scana energy s service as georgia s regulated provider of natural gas ends august  in february  the gpsc initiated a request for proposal rfp bidding process which may be used to select a regulated provider for a new term 
notwithstanding that process  in which scana energy is expected to participate  the gpsc may elect to extend scana energy s current contract term by one year 
scana energy files financial and other information periodically with the gpsc  and such information is available at www 
psc

at december   scana energy s regulated division served over  customers 
scana energy and scana s other natural gas distribution and marketing segments maintain gas inventory and also utilize forward contracts and financial instruments  including futures contracts and options  to manage their exposure to fluctuating commodity natural gas prices 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a part of this risk management process  at any given time  a portion of scana s projected natural gas needs has been purchased or otherwise placed under contract 
since scana energy operates in a competitive market  it may be unable to sustain its current levels of customers and or pricing  thereby reducing expected margins and profitability 
further  there can be no assurance that georgia s gas delivery regulatory framework will remain unchanged as dynamic market conditions evolve 
energy marketing the divisions of semi  excluding scana energy  comprise the energy marketing segment 
this segment markets natural gas primarily in the southeast and provides energy related risk management services to producers and customers 
the operating results for energy marketing are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas and the ability to control costs 
demand for natural gas is primarily affected by the price of alternate fuels and customer growth 
results of operations the company s reported earnings are determined in accordance with gaap 
management believes that  in addition to reported earnings under gaap  the company s gaap adjusted net earnings from operations provides a meaningful representation of its fundamental earnings power and can aid in performing period over period financial analysis and comparison with peer group data 
in management s opinion  gaap adjusted net earnings from operations is a useful indicator of the financial results of the company s primary businesses 
this measure is also a basis for management s provision of earnings guidance and growth projections  and it is used by management in making resource allocation and other budgetary and operational decisions 
this non gaap performance measure is not intended to replace the gaap measure of net earnings  but is offered as a supplement to it 
a reconciliation of reported gaap earnings per share to gaap adjusted net earnings from operations per share  as well as cash dividend information  is provided in the table below reported gaap earnings per share add deduct cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax charge reduction in charge related to propane litigation gains from sales of telecommunications investments losses from sales of telecommunications investments telecommunications investment impairments gaap adjusted net earnings from operations per share cash dividends declared per share discussion of above adjustments the cumulative effect of an accounting change in resulted from the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standard sfas revised  share based payment sfas r 
the charge related to propane litigation recognized in resulted from an unfavorable verdict in a case in which an unsuccessful bidder for the purchase of certain of the company s propane gas assets in alleged breach of contract and related claims 
the litigation was settled in for an amount that was less than had been previously accrued 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
realized gains in and realized losses in were recognized on sales of telecommunications investments 
unrealized impairments on certain of these investments were recognized in all significant telecommunications investments have now been monetized 

table of contents management believes that all of the above adjustments are appropriate in determining the non gaap financial performance measure 
management utilizes such measure itself in exercising budgetary control  managing business operations and determining eligibility for certain incentive compensation payments 
such non gaap measure is based on management s decision that the passive telecommunications investments were not a part of the company s core businesses and would not be available to provide earnings on a long term basis 
the non gaap measure also provides a consistent basis upon which to measure performance by excluding the effects on per share earnings of transactions involving the company s telecommunications investments and the litigation charge and reduction related to the sale of a prior business 
pension income pension income was recorded on the company s financial statements as follows millions of dollars income statement impact reduction in employee benefit costs other income balance sheet impact reduction in capital expenditures component of amount due to summer station co owner total pension income for the last several years  the market value of the company s retirement plan pension assets has exceeded the total actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits

income taxes income taxes  exclusive of amounts related to the cumulative effect of an accounting change  increased in compared to by million and decreased in compared to by million 
changes in income taxes are primarily due to changes in operating income and other income  although in the benefits of synthetic fuel credits of million were also recognized pursuant to the january electric rate order 
the company s effective tax rate has been favorably impacted in recent years by the flow through of state investment tax credits and the equity portion of afc 
recognition of synthetic fuel tax credits sce g holds equity method investments in two partnerships involved in converting coal to synthetic fuel  the use of which fuel qualifies for federal income tax credits 
under an accounting plan approved by the public service commission of south carolina scpsc in june  the synthetic fuel tax credits generated by the partnerships and passed through to sce g  net of partnership losses and other expenses  were deferred until the scpsc approved its application to offset capital costs of the lake murray back up dam project 
under the accounting methodology approved by the scpsc in a january order  construction costs related to the project were recorded in utility plant in service in a special dam remediation account outside of rate base  and depreciation is being recognized against the balance in this account on an accelerated basis  subject to the availability of the synthetic fuel tax credits 
the level of depreciation expense and related tax benefit recognized in the income statement is equal to the available synthetic fuel tax credits  less partnership losses and other expenses  net of taxes 
as a result  the balance of unrecovered costs in the dam remediation account declines as accelerated depreciation is recorded 
although these entries collectively have no impact on consolidated net income  they have a significant impact on individual line items within the income statement 
the accelerated depreciation  synthetic fuel tax credits  partnership losses and the income tax benefit arising from such losses recognized by sce g during and are as follows millions of dollars depreciation and amortization expense income tax benefits from synthetic fuel tax credits from accelerated depreciation from partnership losses total income tax benefits losses from equity method investments impact on net income the amounts above reflect the recognition of previously deferred tax credits  while the amounts reflect the likelihood that credits available in will be phased down pursuant to regulations which limit the credits based on the relative commodity price of crude oil 
depreciation on the lake murray back up dam project account will be matched to available synthetic fuel tax credits on a quarterly basis until the balance in the dam remediation account is zero or until all of the available synthetic fuel tax credits have been utilized 
the synthetic fuel tax credit program expires at the end of the availability of the synthetic fuel tax credits is dependent on several factors  one of which is the average annual domestic wellhead price per barrel of crude oil as published by the us government 
under a phase out provision included in the program  if the domestic wellhead reference price of oil per barrel for a given year is below an inflation adjusted benchmark range for that year  all of the synthetic fuel tax credits that have been generated in that year would be available for use 
if that price is above the benchmark range  none of the tax credits would be available 
if that price falls within the benchmark range  a calculated portion of the credits would be available 
the benchmark price range for  published in april  was to per barrel  and no phase out applied 
however  sce g s analysis indicates that the available synthetic fuel tax credits for are likely to be impacted by the phase out calculation 
as such  in the company recorded synthetic fuel tax credits and applied those credits to allow the recording of accelerated depreciation related to the balance in the dam remediation project account based on an estimate that only of credits generated will be available phase out of 
the company cannot predict what impact  if any  the price of oil may have on the company s ability to earn and utilize synthetic fuel tax credits in the future 
however  there is significant uncertainty as to the continued availability of the credits in the availability of these synthetic fuel tax credits is also subject to coal availability and other operational risks related to the generating plants 
the company does not expect available credits to be sufficient to fully recover the construction costs of dam remediation  and total unrecovered cost at the end of december  may be significant 
to the extent that available credits are not sufficient to fully recover the construction costs of the dam remediation  regulatory action to allow recovery of those remaining costs may be sought 
as of december   remaining unrecovered costs  based on management s recording of accelerated depreciation and related tax benefits  were million 
finally  primesouth  inc  a subsidiary of scana  provides management and maintenance services for a non affiliated synthetic fuel production facility 
reduced synthetic fuel tax credit availability under the above phase out provisions also adversely impacts the level of payment primesouth receives for these services 
the fees recognized by primesouth in were million lower than amounts recognized in liquidity and capital resources cash requirements for scana s regulated subsidiaries arise primarily from their operational needs  funding their construction programs and payment of dividends to scana 
the ability of the regulated subsidiaries to replace existing plant investment  to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas and to install equipment necessary to comply with environmental regulations  will depend on their ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms 
regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers 
rates for regulated services are generally based on historical costs 
as customer growth and inflation occur and these subsidiaries continue their ongoing construction programs  rate increases will be sought 
the future financial position and results of operations of the regulated subsidiaries will be affected by their ability to obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief  if requested 
sce g expects to require the addition of base load electrical generation by and is evaluating alternatives  including fossil and nuclear fueled generation facilities 
in february  sce g and the south carolina public service authority santee cooper  a state owned utility in south carolina joint owners of v 
c 
summer nuclear station summer station  announced their selection of the summer station site as the preferred site for new nuclear generation facilities should such generation be considered the best alternative in the future 
due to the significant lead time required for construction of nuclear generation facilities  the joint owners are preparing an application to the united states nuclear regulatory commission nrc for a combined construction and operating license col that would cover two nuclear units 
the col application  which is expected to be completed and filed in  would be reviewed by the nrc for an estimated three years 
issuance of a col would not obligate the joint owners to build nuclear generation facilities 
the final decision to build nuclear generation facilities will be influenced by several factors  including nrc licensing attainment  estimates of construction and operating costs  the cost of competing fuels  regulatory and environmental requirements and financial market conditions 
the company s leverage ratio of debt to capital was at december  if the agencies rating the company s credit determine that the company s leverage ratio  among other measures  is too high  these rating agencies may downgrade the company s debt 
such a downgrade would adversely affect the interest rate the company is able to obtain when issuing debt  both short term and long term  and would limit the company s access to capital markets 

table of contents the company s current estimates of its capital expenditures for construction and nuclear fuel for  which are subject to continuing review and adjustment  are as follows estimated capital expenditures millions of dollars sce g electric plant generation including genco transmission distribution other nuclear fuel gas common and other total sce g other companies combined total the company s contractual cash obligations as of december  are summarized as follows contractual cash obligations millions of dollars total less than year years years after years long term and short term debt including interest and preferred stock capital leases operating leases purchase obligations other commercial commitments total included in other commercial commitments are estimated obligations under forward contracts for natural gas purchases 
forward contracts for natural gas purchases include customary make whole or default provisions  but are not considered to be take or pay contracts 
certain of these contracts relate to regulated businesses  therefore  the effects of such contracts on fuel costs are reflected in electric or gas rates 
also included in other commercial commitments is a take and pay contract for natural gas which expires in and estimated obligations for coal and nuclear fuel purchases 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
included in purchase obligations are customary purchase orders under which the company has the option to utilize certain vendors without the obligation to do so 
the company may terminate such obligations without penalty 
in addition to the contractual cash obligations above  the company sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan and an unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plan for retirees 
the pension plan is adequately funded  and no further contributions are anticipated until after cash payments under the health care and life insurance benefit plan were million in  and such annual payments are expected to increase to the million range in the future 
in addition  the company is party to certain new york mercantile exchange nymex futures contracts for which any unfavorable market movements are funded in cash 
these derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  and their effects are reflected within other comprehensive income until the anticipated sales transactions occur

the company anticipates that its contractual cash obligations will be met through internally generated funds and the incurrence of additional short term and long term indebtedness 
the company expects that it has or can obtain adequate sources of financing to meet its projected cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
cash outlays for actual and estimated for certain expenditures are as follows millions of dollars property additions and construction expenditures  net of afc nuclear fuel expenditures investments total financing limits and related matters the company s issuance of various securities  including long term and short term debt  is subject to customary approval or authorization by regulatory bodies including state public service commissions and ferc 
descriptions of financing programs currently utilized by the company follow 
pursuant to section of the federal power act  sce g and genco must obtain ferc authority to issue short term debt 
effective february  the ferc has authorized sce g and genco to issue up to million and million  respectively  of unsecured promissory notes or commercial paper with maturity dates of one year or less

scana corporation scana has in effect a medium term note program for the issuance from time to time of unsecured medium term debt securities 
the indenture under which they are issued contains no specific limit on the amount which may be issued 
south carolina electric gas company in september sce g discharged its bond indenture dated january  which covered substantially all of its properties 
sce g remains subject to a bond indenture dated april  mortgage covering substantially all of its electric properties under which all of its currently outstanding first mortgage bonds and all of its future mortgage backed debt bonds has been and will be issued 
bonds may be issued under the mortgage in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding the sum of of unfunded net property additions as therein defined  the aggregate principal amount of retired bonds and cash deposited with the trustee 
bonds will be issuable under the mortgage only if adjusted net earnings as therein defined for consecutive months out of the months immediately preceding the month of issuance are at least twice the annual interest requirements on all outstanding bonds and bonds to be outstanding bond ratio 
for the year ended december   the bond ratio was 
sce g s restated articles of incorporation articles prohibit issuance of additional shares of preferred stock without the consent of the preferred shareholders unless net earnings as therein defined for the consecutive months immediately preceding the month of issuance are at least one and one half times the aggregate of all interest charges and preferred stock dividend requirements on all shares of preferred stock outstanding immediately after the proposed issue preferred stock ratio 
for the year ended december   the preferred stock ratio was 
the articles also require the consent of a majority of the total voting power of sce g s preferred stock before sce g may issue or assume any unsecured indebtedness if  after such issue or assumption  the total principal amount of all such unsecured indebtedness would exceed ten percent of the aggregate principal amount of all of sce g s secured indebtedness and capital and surplus the ten percent test 
no such consent is required to enter into agreements for payment of principal  interest and premium for securities issued for pollution control purposes 
at december   the ten percent test would have limited total issuances of unsecured indebtedness to approximately million 
unsecured indebtedness at december   totaled approximately million  and was comprised primarily of short term borrowings 
financing cash flows during the company experienced net cash outflows related to financing activities of million primarily due to the payment of dividends  which were partially offset by net increases in long term and short term borrowings and proceeds from common stock issuances 
the company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk 
these swap agreements provide for the company to pay variable and receive fixed rate interest payments and are designated as fair value hedges of certain debt instruments 
the company may terminate a swap agreement and may replace it with a new swap also designated as a fair value hedge 
payments received upon termination of such swaps are recorded as basis adjustments to long term debt and are amortized as reductions to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt 
at december   the estimated fair value of the company s swaps totaled a million gain related to combined notional amounts of million 
in anticipation of the issuance of debt  the company may use interest rate lock or similar agreements to manage interest rate risk 
payments received or made upon termination of such agreements are recorded within long term debt on the balance sheet and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt 
in connection with the issuance of first mortgage bonds in june  sce g received approximately million upon the termination of an interest rate lock 
these proceeds are being amortized over the life of the related debt  thereby reducing its effective interest rate

electric operations in march  the united states environmental protection agency epa issued a final rule known as the clean air interstate rule cair 
cair requires the district of columbia and states  including south carolina  to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions in order to attain mandated state levels 
sce g has petitioned the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit to review cair 
several other electric utilities have filed separate petitions 
the petitioners seek a change in the method cair uses to allocate sulfur dioxide emission allowances to a method the petitioners believe is more equitable 
the company believes that installation of additional air quality controls will be needed to meet the cair requirements 
the company is reviewing the final rule 
compliance plans and cost to comply with the rule will be determined once the company completes its review 
such costs will be material and are expected to be recoverable through rates 

table of contents in march  the epa issued a final rule establishing a mercury emissions cap and trade program for coal fired power plants that requires limits to be met in two phases  in and although the company expects to be able to meet the phase i limits through those measures it already will be taking to meet its cair obligations  it is uncertain as to how the phase ii limits will be met 
assuming phase ii limits remain unchanged  installation of additional air quality controls likely will be required to comply with the rule s phase ii mercury emission caps 
final compliance plans and costs to comply with the rule are still under review 
such costs will be material and are expected to be recoverable through rates 
the epa has undertaken an aggressive enforcement initiative against the utilities industry  and the united states department of justice doj has brought suit against a number of utilities in federal court alleging violations of the clean air act caa 
at least two of these suits have either been tried or have had substantive motions decided one favorable to the industry and one not 
the one not favorable to the industry is not binding as precedent and the one favorable to the industry likely is precedent and is consistent with current company interpretation of the law and its resulting maintenance practices 
prior to the suits  those utilities had received requests for information under section of the caa and were issued notices of violation 
the basis for these suits is the assertion by the epa  under a stringent rule known as new source review nsr  that maintenance activities undertaken by the utilities over the past or more years constitute major modifications which would have required the installation of costly best available control technology bact 
sce g and genco have received and responded to section requests for information related to canadys  wateree and williams stations 
the regulations under the caa provide certain exemptions to the definition of major modifications  including an exemption for routine repair  replacement or maintenance 
on october   epa published a final revised nsr rule in the federal register with an effective date of december  the rule represents an industry favorable departure from certain positions advanced by the federal government in the nsr enforcement initiative 
however  on motion of several northeastern states  the united states circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia stayed the effect of the final rule 
the ultimate application of the final rule to the company is uncertain 
the company has analyzed each of the activities covered by the epa s requests and believes each of these activities is covered by the exemption for routine repair  replacement and maintenance under what it believes is a fair reading of both the prior regulation and the contested revised regulation 
the regulations also provide an exemption for an increase in emissions resulting from increased hours of operation or production rate and from demand growth 
the current state of continued doj enforcement actions is the subject of industry wide speculation  but it is possible that the epa will commence enforcement actions against sce g and genco  and the epa has the authority to seek penalties at the rate of up to  per day for each violation 
the epa also could seek installation of bact or equivalent at the three plants 
the company believes that any enforcement actions relative to the company s compliance with the caa would be without merit 
the company has completed installation of selective catalytic reactors at wateree and williams for nitrogen oxides control and is proceeding with plans to install sulfur dioxide scrubbers at both of these stations to meet cair regulations 
these actions would mitigate many of the concerns with nsr 
sce g and genco expect to incur capital expenditures totaling approximately million over the period to install this new equipment 
sce g and genco expect to have increased operation and maintenance costs of approximately million in and million in and each subsequent year thereafter 
to meet compliance requirements for the years through  the company anticipates additional capital expenditures totaling approximately million 
the clean water act  as amended  provides for the imposition of effluent limitations that require treatment for wastewater discharges 
under the clean water act  compliance with applicable limitations is achieved under a national permit program 
discharge permits have been issued for all  and renewed for nearly all  of sce g s and genco s generating units 
concurrent with renewal of these permits  the permitting agency has implemented a more rigorous program of monitoring and controlling discharges  has modified the requirements for cooling water intake structures  and has required strategies for toxicity reduction in wastewater streams 
the company is conducting studies and is developing or implementing compliance plans for these initiatives 
congress is expected to consider further amendments to the clean water act 
such legislation may include limitations to mixing zones and toxicity based standards 
these provisions  if passed  could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of the company  sce g and genco 
the nuclear waste policy act of nuclear waste act required that the united states government  by january   accept and permanently dispose of high level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel 
the nuclear waste act also imposed on utilities the primary responsibility for storage of their spent nuclear fuel until the repository is available 
sce g entered into a standard contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel and or high level radioactive waste standard contract with the doe in providing for permanent disposal of its spent nuclear fuel in exchange for agreed payments fixed in the standard contract at particular amounts 
on january   sce g and santee cooper one third owner of summer station filed suit in the court of federal claims against the doe for breach of the standard contract  because as of the date of filing  the federal government had accepted no spent fuel from summer station or any other utility for transport and disposal  and has indicated that it does not anticipate doing so until  at the earliest 
as a consequence of the federal government s breach of contract  the plaintiffs have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs 
on january   sce g and santee cooper accepted a million settlement from doe 
the payment reimbursed the plaintiffs for certain costs incurred from january  through july  sce g recorded its portion million of the settlement as a reduction to its fuel costs 
as a result  most of the credit was passed through to its customers through the fuel clause component of its retail electric rates 
the settlement also provides for the plaintiffs to submit an annual application to doe for the reimbursement of certain costs incurred subsequent to july  sce g has on site spent nuclear fuel storage capability until at least and expects to be able to expand its storage capacity to accommodate the spent nuclear fuel output for the life of the plant through dry cask storage or other technology as it becomes available 
sce g has been named  along with others  by the epa as a prp at the alternate energy resources  inc aer superfund site located in augusta  georgia 
the epa placed the site on the national priorities list on april  aer conducted hazardous waste storage and treatment operations from to  when the site was abandoned 
while operational  aer processed fuels from waste oils  treated industrial coolants and oil water emulsions  recycled solvents and blended hazardous waste fuels 
during that time  sce g occasionally used aer for the processing of waste solvents  oily rags and oily wastewater 
epa and the state of georgia have documented that a release or releases have occurred at the site leading to contamination of groundwater  surface water and soils 
epa and the state of georgia have conducted a preliminary assessment and site inspection 
the site has not been cleaned up nor has a cleanup cost been estimated 
although a basis for the allocation of clean up costs among the prps is unclear  sce g does not believe that its involvement at this site would result in an allocation of costs that would have a material adverse impact on its results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
any cost allocated to sce g arising from the remediation of this site  net of insurance recoveries  if any  is expected to be recoverable through rates 
sce g has been named  along with others  by the epa as a potentially responsible party prp at the carolina transformer superfund site located in fayetteville  north carolina 
the carolina transformer company ctc conducted an electrical transformer rebuilding and repair operation at the site from to during that time  sce g occasionally used ctc for the repair of existing transformers  purchase of new transformers and sale of used transformers 
in  epa initiated a cleanup of pcb contaminated soil and groundwater at the site 
epa reports that it has spent million to date 
although a basis for the allocation of clean up costs among the prps is unclear  sce g does not believe that its involvement at this site would result in an allocation of costs that would have a material adverse impact on its results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
any cost allocated to sce g arising from the remediation of this site  net of insurance recoveries  if any  is expected to be recoverable through rates 
gas distribution the company maintains an environmental assessment program to identify and evaluate current and former operations sites that could require environmental cleanup 
as site assessments are initiated  estimates are made of the amount of expenditures  if any  deemed necessary to investigate and clean up each site 
these estimates are refined as additional information becomes available  therefore  actual expenditures may differ significantly from the original estimates 
amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and cleanup relate solely to regulated operations 
such amounts are recorded in deferred debits and amortized with recovery provided through rates 
deferred amounts for sce g  net of amounts previously recovered through rates and insurance settlements  totaled million at december  and million at december  the deferral includes the estimated costs associated with the following matters 
sce g owns a decommissioned mgp site in the calhoun park area of charleston  south carolina 
sce g anticipates that remediation for contamination at the site will be completed in late  with certain monitoring and retreatment activities continuing until as of december   sce g has spent million to remediate the calhoun park site  and expects to spend an additional million 
in addition  the national park service of the department of the interior made an initial demand to sce g for payment of million for certain costs and damages relating to this site 
sce g expects to recover any cost arising from the remediation of this site through rates 
sce g owns three other decommissioned mgp sites in south carolina which contain residues of by product chemicals 
one of the sites has been remediated and will undergo routine monitoring until released by dhec 
the other sites are currently being investigated under work plans approved by dhec 
sce g anticipates that major remediation activities for the three sites will be completed in as of december   sce g has spent million related to these three sites  and expects to spend an additional million 
sce g expects to recover any cost arising from the remediation of these sites through rates 

table of contents psnc energy is responsible for environmental cleanup at five sites in north carolina on which mgp residuals are present or suspected 
psnc energy s remediation costs for these sites will depend on a number of factors  such as actual site conditions  third party claims and recoveries from other prps 
psnc energy has recorded a liability and associated regulatory asset of million  which reflects its estimated remaining liability at december  amounts incurred and deferred to date  net of insurance settlements  that are not currently being recovered through gas rates are million

the united states congress passed the pipeline safety improvement act of the pipeline safety act  directing the united states department of transportation dot to establish the integrity management rule for operations of natural gas systems with transmission pipelines located near moderate to high density populations 
of psnc energy s approximately miles of transmission pipeline subject to the pipeline safety act  approximately miles are located within these areas 
fifty percent of these miles of pipeline must be assessed by december  and the remainder by december depending on the assessment method used  psnc energy will be required to reinspect these same miles of pipeline every five to seven years 
though cost estimates for this project were developed using various assumptions  each of which is subject to imprecision  psnc energy currently estimates the total cost through december to be million for the initial assessments  not including any subsequent remediation that may be required 
effective november  the ncuc authorized deferral accounting for certain expenses incurred to comply with dot s pipeline integrity management requirements 
in accordance with an october ncuc rate order  million in costs incurred and deferred through june  are now being recovered through rates over a three year period 
additionally  management believes that all subsequent costs will be recoverable by psnc energy through rates 
carolina gas transmission corporation cgtc has approximately miles of transmission line that are covered by the integrity management rule of the pipeline safety act 
though cost estimates for this project were developed using various assumptions  each of which is subject to imprecision  cgtc currently estimates the total cost to be million for the initial assessments and any subsequent remediation required through december critical accounting policies and estimates following are descriptions of the company s accounting policies and estimates which are most critical in terms of reporting financial condition or results of operations 
utility regulation scana s regulated utilities are subject to the provisions of sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  which require them to record certain assets and liabilities that defer the recognition of expenses and revenues to future periods as a result of being rate regulated 
in the future  as a result of deregulation or other changes in the regulatory environment  the company may no longer meet the criteria for continued application of sfas and could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  liquidity or financial position of the company s electric distribution and gas distribution segments in the period the write off would be recorded 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s regulatory assets and liabilities  including those associated with the company s environmental assessment program 
the company s generation assets would be exposed to considerable financial risks in a deregulated electric market 
if market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for recovery of the resulting stranded costs  the company could be required to write down its investment in those assets 
the company cannot predict whether any write downs will be necessary and  if they are  the extent to which they would adversely affect the company s results of operations in the period in which they would be recorded 
as of december   the company s net investments in fossil hydro and nuclear generation assets were approximately billion and million  respectively 
revenue recognition and unbilled revenues revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers 
because customers of the company s utilities and retail gas operations are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual reading of their electric and gas meters  the company records estimates for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period 
such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of the amount of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last reading of their meters 
such unbilled revenues reflect consideration of estimated usage by customer class  the effects of different rate schedules  changes in weather and  where applicable  the impact of weather normalization provisions of rate structures 
the accrual of unbilled revenues in this manner properly matches revenues and related costs 
accounts receivable included unbilled revenues of million at december  and million at december   compared to total revenues of billion for and billion for provisions for bad debts and allowances for doubtful accounts as of each balance sheet date  the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and records allowances for doubtful accounts based on estimates of the level of expected write offs 
these estimates are based on  among other things  comparisons of the relative age of accounts  assigned credit ratings for commercial and industrial accounts  credit scores for residential customers in georgia when available  and consideration of actual write off history 
the distribution segments of the company s regulated utilities have established write off histories and regulated service areas that tend to improve the recoverability of accounts and enable the utilities to reliably estimate their respective provisions for bad debts 
the company s retail gas marketing segment operates in georgia s deregulated natural gas market in which customers may obtain service from others without necessarily paying outstanding amounts and in which there are certain limitations on the company s ability to effect timely shut off of service for nonpayment 
as such estimation of the provision for bad debts for these accounts is subject to greater imprecision 
nuclear decommissioning accounting for decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future 
among the factors that could change sce g s accounting estimates related to decommissioning costs are changes in technology  changes in regulatory and environmental remediation requirements  and changes in financial assumptions such as discount rates and timing of cash flows 
changes in any of these estimates could significantly impact the company s financial position and cash flows although changes in such estimates should be earnings neutral  because these costs are expected to be collected from ratepayers 
sce g s two thirds share of estimated site specific nuclear decommissioning costs for summer station  including both the cost of decommissioning plant components that are and are not subject to radioactive contamination  totals million  stated in dollars  based on a decommissioning study completed in santee cooper is responsible for decommissioning costs related to its one third ownership interest in summer station 
the cost estimate assumes that the site would be maintained over a period of years in such a manner as to allow for subsequent decontamination that would permit release for unrestricted use 
under sce g s method of funding decommissioning costs  amounts collected through rates are invested in insurance policies on the lives of certain company personnel 
sce g transfers to an external trust fund the amounts collected through electric rates  insurance proceeds  and interest on proceeds  less expenses 
the trusteed asset balance reflects the net cash surrender value of the insurance policies held by the trust 
management intends for the fund  including earnings thereon  to provide for all eventual decommissioning expenditures on an after tax basis 

table of contents accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits the company follows sfas  employers accounting for pensions  as amended by sfas  employees accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  in accounting for the cost of its defined benefit pension plan 
the company s plan is adequately funded and as such  net pension income is reflected in the financial statements see results of operations pension income 
sfas requires the use of several assumptions  the selection of which may have a large impact on the resulting benefit recorded 
among the more sensitive assumptions are those surrounding discount rates and expected returns on assets 
net pension income of million recorded in reflects the use of a discount rate and an assumed long term rate of return on plan assets 
the company believes that these assumptions were  and that the resulting pension income amount was  reasonable 
for purposes of comparison  using a discount rate of in would have decreased the company s pension income by million 
had the assumed long term rate of return on assets been  the company s pension income for would have been reduced by million 
for  the company selected the discount rate of which was derived using a cash flow matching technique 
for  the discount rate to be used will be  which was derived using that same cash flow matching technique 
the same discount rates were also selected for determination of other postemployment benefits costs discussed below 
the following information with respect to pension assets and returns thereon should also be noted 
the company determines the fair value of substantially all of its pension assets utilizing market quotes rather than utilizing any calculated values  market related values or other modeling techniques 
in developing the expected long term rate of return assumptions  the company evaluates input from actuaries and from pension fund investment consultants 
such consultants review of the plan s historical   and year cumulative performance showed actual returns of   and  respectively  all of which have been in excess of related broad indices 
the expected long term rate of return of was based on a target asset allocation of with equity managers and with fixed income managers 
management regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the portfolio when considered appropriate 
for  the expected rate of return will be 
the pension trust is adequately funded  and no contributions have been required since management does not anticipate the need to make pension contributions until after similar to its pension accounting  the company follows sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  as amended by sfas in accounting for the cost of its postretirement medical and life insurance benefits 
this plan is unfunded  so no assumptions related to rate of return on assets impact the net expense recorded  however  the selection of discount rates can significantly impact the actuarial determination of net expense 
the company used a discount rate of and recorded a net sfas cost of million for had the selected discount rate been  the expense for would have been million higher 
because the plan provisions include caps on company per capita costs  healthcare cost inflation rate assumptions do not materially impact the net expense recorded 
the company also adopted the balance sheet recognition provisions of sfas effective december   as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
asset retirement obligations sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  together with financial accounting standards board interpretation fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  provides guidance for recording and disclosing liabilities related to future legally enforceable obligations to retire assets aro 
sfas applies to the legal obligation associated with the retirement of long lived tangible assets that result from their acquisition  construction  development and normal operation 
because such obligation relates primarily to the company s regulated utility operations  sfas and fin have no significant impact on results of operations 
as of december   the company has recorded an aro of million for nuclear plant decommissioning as discussed above and an aro of million for other conditional obligations related to generation  transmission and distribution properties  including gas pipelines 
the aro for nuclear plant decommissioning reflects a reduction of million from the corresponding aro recorded as of december  the reduction is primarily related to the expectation of lower decommissioning cost escalations than had been assumed in the prior cash flow analysis 
all of the amounts recorded in connection with sfas and fin are based upon estimates which are subject to varying degrees of imprecision  particularly since such payments will be made many years in the future 
changes in these estimates will be recorded over time  however  these changes in estimates are not expected to materially impact results of operations so long as the regulatory framework for the company s utilities remains in place 
other matters off balance sheet financing although scana invests in securities and business ventures  it does not hold investments in unconsolidated special purpose entities such as those described in sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  or as described in fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
scana does not engage in off balance sheet financing or similar transactions  although it is party to incidental operating leases in the normal course of business  generally for office space  furniture and equipment
