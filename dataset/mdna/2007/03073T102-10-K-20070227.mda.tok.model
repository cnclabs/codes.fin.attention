item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a multi state managed healthcare company focused on serving people who receive healthcare benefits through publicly sponsored programs  including medicaid  schip  familycare and snp 
we were founded in december with the objective of becoming the leading managed care organization in the us focused on serving people who receive these types of benefits 
after over a decade of operations  we continue to believe that managed healthcare remains the only proven mechanism that significantly reduces medical costs  helps our government partners control their costs  and improves health outcomes for those receiving these types of benefits 
revenue growth in we continued to increase our membership achieving total membership growth of  members or to  members at december  premium revenues increased approximately million or 
our largest single source of growth resulted from entry into the state of georgia 
effective june   georgia implemented a statewide medicaid managed care program and amerigroup through its subsidiary amgp georgia managed care company  inc  began serving four of the state s six regions  including atlanta 
this represents approximately of our premium revenue growth for the year ended december  additionally  we began operating as a snp in our houston  texas market on january   offering managed healthcare services to the dual eligible population 
this represents approximately of our revenue growth for the year ended december  our remaining of premium revenue growth is a result of organic growth in our existing markets as a result of premium rate increases which averaged approximately 
this growth was partially offset by our exit from the state of illinois effective july   and declining enrollment in florida and new york that we believe was caused by administrative or legislative issues that both states are attempting to address 
additionally  as a result of provider network changes our new jersey enrollment has declined 
other growth includes in texas  our largest state  we added operations in a fifth local market corpus christi to the star program  which serves medicaid mothers and children 
in the star plus program  which serves people with long term illnesses or disabilities  we secured two new local markets  austin and san antonio  which began operations in february we also began serving medicaid mothers and children in dayton  ohio and anticipate that we will have the opportunity to serve people with long term disabilities in cincinnati in in virginia  we expanded our service area for medicaid mothers and children into the outer suburbs of washington  dc in florida  we were selected to participate in a state medicaid reform program in broward county 
additionally  the premium revenue for the year ended december  was impacted by a net favorable prior period revenue adjustment totaling million resulting from various premium recoupment issues in several of our markets 
net of the related income tax effect  net income increased approximately million or per diluted share for the year ended december  as a result of this net favorable prior period revenue adjustment 
opportunities for future growth we anticipate growth in as a result of several key drivers 
in maryland  we will begin operating our company s second snp  effective january  in  the state of tennessee chose amerigroup  through its subsidiary amerigroup tennessee  inc  as one of two companies to participate in its restructured tenncare program 
we anticipate that our operations in tennessee will commence in mid with approximately  members 
we are also in advanced negotiations to begin operations in two other states 
we are working with the state of south carolina to begin serving medicaid mothers and children in the greenville spartanburg area 
we are also working with the state of new mexico to serve people with long term illnesses and disabilities there 
we can make no assurance that these efforts will result in new business for us or if that new business will be favorable to our results of operations or financial condition 
as of december   approximately of our current membership has resulted from ten acquisitions 
we periodically evaluate acquisition opportunities to determine if they meet our return metrics 
we continue to believe acquisitions will be an important part of our long term growth strategy 
status of qui tam litigation on october   the jury in the qui tam litigation against the company and amerigroup illinois  inc returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs in the amount of million  which  under applicable law will be trebled to million  plus penalties 
the jury also found that there were  false claims 
under the federal false claims act  false claims carry a penalty of between  and  per claim 
under the illinois whistleblower and reward and protection act  ilc  false claims carry a penalty of between  and  per claim 
to date  the court has not determined the amount of the statutory penalties 
we timely filed motions for a new trial and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict 
on february   the court heard oral arguments on all post trial motions 
the court has not yet ruled on the motions  but we expect that a ruling is imminent 
in the event that the court rules in favor of the plaintiffs motions  the court could enter a judgment against us in an amount up to million  plus attorneys fees  costs and expenses of tyson s counsel 
in the event that our motions are denied  we intend to appeal the judgment to the us court of appeals for the seventh circuit 
in order to stay the execution of the judgment of the court during the pendency of our appeal  we may be required to establish a supersedeas bond equal to an amount set forth by the court in its final judgment  plus one year of interest 
we may raise the necessary financing to collateralize a letter of credit in favor of the court through any combination of one or more of the following i borrowing additional amounts under our credit agreement  ii using existing unregulated cash and investments  iii issuing debt  preferred stock and or equity securities including debt securities or preferred stock convertible into our common equity  under our shelf registration and or in one or more public or rule a offerings or privately negotiated transactions  and or iv entering into additional credit arrangements 
if we incur additional debt  it may limit our access to capital in the future which could impact our ability to meet statutory net worth requirements in the states in which we do business and limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities or enter new states 
additionally  any new credit arrangements may call for significant debt service requirements and have less favorable interest terms than under our current credit agreement 
any issuance of equity securities or debt or preferred stock convertible into our equity securities could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
depending upon the ultimate outcome  the amount of the final judgment against us could negatively impact our liquidity and could cause any amounts borrowed  or otherwise owed  under the credit agreement to become due and payable 
although it is possible that the ultimate outcome of the qui tam litigation will not be favorable to us  the amount of a loss  if any  is uncertain 
accordingly  we have not recorded any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes  if any 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
if we were to incur significant losses in connection with the qui tam litigation  the company could fail to meet certain financial covenants and or other provisions under its credit agreement which would render the company in default under the credit agreement  thereby causing  among other things  any amounts borrowed  or otherwise owed  under the credit agreement to become due and payable 
as a result of the qui tam litigation  it is possible that state or federal governments will subject the company to a greater regulatory scrutiny  investigation  action  or litigation 
we have been proactively in contact with all of the insurance and medicaid regulators in the states in which we operate as well as the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services oig  with respect to the practices at issue in the qui tam litigation 
in connection with our discussions with the oig we entered into a tolling agreement with the oig which preserves the rights that the oig had as of october  until september  in some circumstances  state or federal governments may move to exclude a company from contacts as a result of a civil verdict under the false claims act 
we are unable to predict at this time what  if any  further action any state of federal regulators may take 
exclusion is a discretionary step which we believe would not be commenced  if at all  until all appeals had been exhausted 
further  prior to any administrative action or exclusion taking effect  we believe we would have an opportunity to advocate our position 
while the circumstances of this case do not appear to warrant such action  exclusion from doing business with the federal or any state governments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
it is also possible that plaintiffs in other states could bring similar litigation against the company 
while we believe that the practices at issue in the qui tam litigation have not occurred outside of the operations of the company s illinois subsidiary  a successful verdict in similar litigation in another state could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
operating costs health benefits the following table reconciles the reported health benefits ratio hbr to recast hbr  which reflects the impact of net out of period amounts including adjustments through december   relating to premium revenues and health benefits expenses for the years ended december  and years ended december  reported premium revenues reported health benefits expenses reported hbr reported premium revenues less prior period premium revenues adjustments recast premium revenues reported health benefits expenses plus less prior period health benefits expense developments  net recast health benefits expenses recast hbr hbr on a recast basis decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this is primarily a result of premium rate increases averaging across all markets which was in excess of medical trend 
these rate increases are a result of negotiations with our government partners 
additionally  the commencement of operations of our snp product in our houston  texas market beginning january  resulted in improvement in the hbr 
during the year ended december   health benefits expenses were reduced by approximately million as a result of changes in our estimates of claims payable for prior periods 
net of the related tax impact  net income increased approximately million or per diluted share as a result of this favorable prior period development 
the changes in estimates were a result of actuarial analysis of actual claims paid for dates of service for december  and prior 
this decrease in claims payable is reflected in the above table as an increase in reported health benefits expenses for the year ended december  and a decrease in reported health benefits expenses for the year ended december  in order to present recast health benefits expenses and recast hbr 
in addition to this adjustment  health benefits expenses for the year ended december  is further reduced for changes in estimates in the year ended december  related to dates of service of december  and prior 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a were of total revenues for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  sg a expenses increased primarily as a result of increases in salaries and benefits  including the impact of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas no 
r and the accrual for expenses related to earnings based compensation plans not provided for in the prior year  operational and technology related initiatives  increased premium taxes  and increased legal expenses related to current litigation 
new products and markets on july   amerigroup tennessee  inc was chosen to offer healthcare coverage to medicaid members in the state of tennessee  for the middle grand region 
eligible members in this region are estimated at approximately  members who would be served by two contractors including amerigroup tennessee  inc on august   amerigroup tennessee  inc entered into a contract with the state of tennessee 
amerigroup tennessee  inc expects to begin enrolling members in mid  provided implementation remains on schedule 
amerigroup ohio  inc received an hmo license in and signed a contract with the state of ohio on july   and began enrolling members in september on march   amerigroup ohio  inc was awarded the regions of dayton and cincinnati  covering counties  and began enrolling members on september  additionally  on october   amerigroup ohio  inc won a preliminary endorsement from ohio s department of job and family services to serve  eligible residents enrolled in medicaid s abd program in the southwest region of ohio 
the southwest region includes eight counties near cincinnati 
enrollment of members under this program began in february as a result of a competitive bidding process  our georgia subsidiary  amgp georgia managed care company  inc d b a amerigroup georgia  was chosen in july to offer healthcare coverage to low income residents in four of six regions in the state of georgia 
amerigroup georgia has two competitors in the atlanta region and one competitor in each of the other regions 
we began serving the atlanta region effective june  and in the east  north and southeast regions effective on september  on september   cms designated amerigroup texas  inc  as a snp 
amerigroup texas  inc entered into a contract with cms to offer medicare benefits to dual eligibles that live in and surrounding houston  texas beginning january  amerigroup texas  inc already served these members through the texas medicaid star plus program and offers them the medicare and part d drug benefit under this contract 
on january   we began enrolling dual eligible members living in maryland 
amerigroup maryland  inc now offers these members the medicare and part d drug benefit under this new contract 
our participation in the medicare parts a b and part d programs is based upon assumptions regarding enrollment  utilization  physician  hospital and pharmaceutical costs and other factors 
in the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect  either as a result of unforeseen changes to medicare parts a b and part d or otherwise our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
significant market updates as a result of a competitive bidding process  our wholly owned subsidiary  amerigroup texas  inc was awarded star and schip  or texcare  contracts in its current service areas of houston  dallas and fort worth and contracts in two new service areas of corpus christi and el paso 
amerigroup texas  inc was also granted a star contract for the austin service area 
these contracts were effective september  amerigroup texas  inc has one or more competitors in each of its new and current service areas for the star and texcare programs 
the combined eligibles for these expanded products and markets are approximately  as compared to the previously existing eligible population of  in september  the amerigroup texas  inc notified the state of texas that it had declined the contract award in el paso for the contract period beginning september  amerigroup texas  inc elected not to enter into a contract for the el paso service area due to the competitive environment in that market  which would limit expansion 
the state announced expansion of star plus into four urban areas under a modified structure which will exclude risk on hospitalization costs to protect the upper payment limit 
the state awarded amerigroup texas  inc  the houston expansion  austin  and san antonio regions in addition to our current houston market with an anticipated implementation date in early in the fort worth service area  amerigroup texas  inc had an exclusive risk sharing arrangement with cook children s health care network cchcn and cook children s physician network ccpn  which includes cook children s medical center ccmc  that was terminated as of august  under the risk sharing arrangement the parties have an obligation to perform annual reconciliations and settlements of the risk pool for each contract year 
we believe that cchcn owes us a substantial payment for the contract year  which we estimate is approximately million  as of december  the contract with cchcn prescribes reconciliation procedures with respect to each contract period 
as of this date  we are completing the reconciliation process with cchcn with respect to the contract year 
we recently completed the reconciliation process with cchcn with respect to the contract year resulting in payment in full from cchcn of approximately million 
if we are unable to agree on a settlement  our expenses attributable to these periods may be adversely affected  and we may incur significant costs in our efforts to reach a final resolution of this matter 
amerigroup illinois  inc allowed its contract with the illinois department of healthcare and family services to terminate july  we do not expect the termination of this contract to have a material impact on the financial position  results of operations or liquidity of the company 
we continue to work with cms and the states on implementing the deficit reduction act of cms issued guidelines to the states on june   requiring proof of citizenship for all new enrollees and for re enrollments 
the regulations that came out in early july further exempt ssi recipients and certain other groups and permit use of school records for children  where appropriate 
at this point  we do not anticipate any significant impact on membership as a result of this provision  as most of the states have been trying to reduce the burden of these requirements of this provision for beneficiaries 
georgia and new york already required proof of citizenship and to date we have not been notified of any enrollment issues 
texas is using electronic records to assist beneficiaries and virginia has retrained all of its enrollment officers to ensure a smooth transition 
cms is also planning a widespread outreach effort to help beneficiaries understand the deficit reduction act of however  we can give no assurances that these guidelines will not impact our membership adversely  thereby negatively impacting our business  results of operations and financial condition 
contingencies medicare parts a b one year into our participation as a snp in the houston  texas market  we are receiving fewer medical claims than we expected 
as of december   we paid million of physician and hospital claims for services rendered to our members for medicare parts a b benefits or of the million in estimated incurred expenses 
a liability for incurred but not reported claims of million  representing the difference between the estimated incurred expense and the amount paid  is recorded as a liability in the consolidated financial statements at december  due to the uniqueness of this new program  there are a variety of factors that could contribute to this lower volume of claims 
such factors may include  among other things claims sent in error to other payors  confusion on behalf of providers as to the appropriate payor for the members  retroactive enrollment changes  variability in our enrollment since inception  difficulty adjudicating claims due to new or different medical benefits  complexities associated with a new product causing confusion among the members and providers  and changes in the severity of illness of our members 
all of these factors could cause a delay in the receipt of claims for services provided to our snp members  necessitate re adjudication of claims or result in a retroactive premium adjustment 
we are continuing to evaluate the potential impact of these various factors 
we estimate that our liability related to incurred but not reported medicare parts a b physician and hospital claims to be in the range of approximately million to million 
as discussed above  we have recorded a liability of million in the consolidated financial statements which represents our best estimate at december  in determining our best estimate  our actuaries relied upon their original medical cost estimates based on data provided by cms  and blended in the emerging medical claims experience using a credibility model 
in doing so  more credibility or reliance was placed on the paid claim data and less reliance was placed on our original medical cost estimates as of december  our range of liability related to incurred but not reported medicare parts a b physician and hospital claims represents our original estimates on the upper end of the range and estimates based solely on claims experience on the lower end of the range 
as we continue to evaluate our claims payment experience  favorable prior period development may result 
alternatively  if because of one or more of the factors stated above or for other reasons  we find that additional claims payments more closely approximate or exceed our previous estimate  then our actuarial estimate of incurred claims may be increased resulting in unfavorable prior period development 
we can give no assurance that any prior period development related to this issue in any future periods  whether favorable or unfavorable  will not have a material effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
medicare part d the company s contract with cms includes a risk sharing provision 
the risk sharing provision takes effect if actual pharmacy benefit costs are more than percentage points above or below expected cost levels as submitted by the company in its initial contract application 
we have calculated an estimate of the risk share and accordingly  as of and for the year ended december   we recorded a risk share liability to cms in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and a corresponding retrospective premium adjustment in premium revenues in the consolidated income statements 
the recorded liability represents the estimated amount payable by the company to cms under the risk share contract provision if the program was terminated at december  based on estimated costs incurred through that date 
the final risk share amounts due to or from cms  if any  will be determined approximately six months after the end of the contract year end 
in an effort to reimburse medicare prescription drug plans for drug costs incurred on behalf of medicare beneficiaries who may have switched plans or otherwise may not have been appropriately enrolled in a plan during the part d program start up earlier this year  cms has implemented a reconciliation process to correct payment discrepancies between plans which is referred to as the plan to plan reconciliation project 
this project facilitates the exchange of payments between the plan where the beneficiary is officially enrolled and the plan that paid claims 
during the fourth quarter of  phase of the plan to plan reconciliation was completed with no significant impact on the results of operations of the company 
florida behavioral health a florida statute the statute gives the florida agency for health care administration ahca the right to contract with entities to provide comprehensive behavioral healthcare services  including mental health and substance abuse services 
the statute further requires the contractor to use at least of the capitation for the provision of behavioral healthcare services  with any shortfall in the expenditure being refunded to the state 
in the contract that amerigroup florida  inc has with ahca  amerigroup florida  inc 
is required to provide comprehensive behavioral healthcare services  but the contract defines a limited subset of behavioral healthcare services that can be counted towards the fulfillment of the requirement 
amerigroup florida  inc and other similarly situated contractors have disputed the restrictive definition imposed by ahca and believe that ahca s limited definition does not support meeting our obligation to provide comprehensive healthcare services in accordance with our contract 
there was an attempt to resolve this issue in the most recent session of the florida legislature  which was unsuccessful 
amerigroup florida  inc believes that the implementation by ahca of the restrictive definition of comprehensive behavioral healthcare services in the contract is impermissible and inconsistent with the statutory requirements for administrative rule making 
in february  the company received a determination from ahca indicating amounts owed to ahca of million for the and contract years which has been recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of december  the company has the option to appeal this determination through arbitration and is currently considering this alternative 
the company has reserved approximately million as its best estimate of liability for all prior and current contract periods  which is included in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  experience rebate payable amerigroup texas  inc  our texas subsidiary  is required to pay a rebate to the state of texas in the event profits exceed established levels 
the rebate calculation reports that we filed for the contract years ended august  through have been audited by a contracted auditing firm retained by the state of texas 
in their report  the auditor has challenged inclusion in the rebate calculation certain expenses incurred by the company in providing services to amerigroup texas  inc under the administrative services agreement 
we are not certain whether there has been an ultimate determination by the state of texas with respect to the recommendations to exclude these expenses as defined in the report 
the contract year ending august  is currently being audited by the state contracted firm and the audit of the contract year ended august  is expected to commence in mid although we believe that the rebate calculations were done appropriately  if the regulators were ultimately to disallow certain of these expenses in the rebate calculation  it could result in the requirement that we pay the state of texas additional amounts for these prior periods and it could reduce our profitability in future periods 
at this time  we believe it is reasonably possible that the liability related to this issue could range from zero to million 
new jersey provider network in december  our new jersey subsidiary received a notice of deficiency for failure to meet provider network requirements in several new jersey counties as required by our medicaid contract with new jersey 
we submitted to the state of new jersey a corrective action plan and a request for a waiver of certain contractual provisions in december and january the state of new jersey is considering our requests for waivers  and we have been granted an extension to correct the network deficiencies through june prior to the expiration of the extension  we will work with the state of new jersey to correct certain electronic records and to correct the network deficiencies 
although we believe that we will be able to resolve this issue  if the state of new jersey does not grant further waivers and imposes fines and penalties our financial results could be materially impacted 
discussion of critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be significant 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we generate revenues primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate to arrange for health benefit services for our members 
we receive premiums from cms for the snp program 
we recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
a fixed premium per member per month is paid to us to arrange for healthcare benefit services for our members pursuant to our contracts in each of our markets 
these premium payments are based upon eligibility determined by the state governments with which we have contracted 
errors in this eligibility determination on which we rely can result in positive and negative premium adjustments to the extent this information is adjusted by the state 
in all of our states  except virginia  we are eligible to receive supplemental payments to offset the health benefits expenses associated with the birth of a baby 
each state contract is specific as to what is required before payments are generated 
upon delivery of a newborn  each state is notified according to our contract 
revenue is recognized in the period that the delivery occurs and the related services are provided to our member based on our authorization system for these services 
additionally  in some states we receive supplemental payments for certain services such as high cost drugs and early childhood prevention screenings 
any amounts that have not been received from the state by the end of the period are recorded on our balance sheet as premium receivables 
we also generate income from investments 
estimating health benefits expense and claims payable our results of operations depend on our ability to effectively manage expenses related to health benefits  as well as our ability to accurately predict costs incurred in recording the amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
expenses related to health benefits have two components direct medical expenses and medically related administrative costs 
direct medical expenses include fees paid to hospitals  physicians and providers of ancillary medical services  such as pharmacy  laboratory  radiology  dental and vision 
medically related administrative costs include expenses related to services such as health promotion  quality assurance  case management  disease management and hour on call nurses 
direct medical expenses also include estimates of ibnr 
for the year ended december   approximately of our direct medical payments related to fees paid on a fee for service basis to hospitals  pcps  specialist physicians and other providers  including fees paid to third party vendors for ancillary services 
the balance related to fees paid on a capitation  or per member  basis 
primary care and specialist physicians not paid on a capitation basis are paid on a maximum allowable fee schedule set forth in the contracts with our providers 
we reimburse hospitals on a negotiated per diem  case rate or an agreed upon percent of their standard charges 
in maryland  the state sets the amount reimbursed to hospitals 
fees paid for services provided to our members by hospitals and providers with whom we have no contract are paid based upon our usual and customary fee schedules unless mandated at other levels by state regulation 
we have used a consistent methodology for estimating our medical expenses and medical liabilities since our inception  and have refined our assumptions to take into account our maturing claims  product and market experience 
for new products and markets  we estimate health benefits expense at underwritten levels until actual historical experience becomes reliable or credible enough to incorporate into our estimates 
typically this occurs at approximately six months after inception 
in the case of our snp product  claims payments have been significantly lower than underwritten levels 
therefore  our actuaries relied upon their original cost estimates based on data provided by cms and blended in the emerging medical claims experience 
in doing so  more credibility or reliance was placed on the paid claims data and less reliance was placed on our original cost estimates as of december  as medical utilization patterns and cost trends change from year to year  our underlying claims payments reflect the variations in experience 
our estimates are revised based upon actual claims payments using historical per member per month claims cost  including provider settlements  changes in the age and gender of our membership  variations in the severity of medical conditions  high dollar claims and authorization data 
each of these factors may be considered in determining our current medical liabilities 
there are certain aspects of the managed care business that are not predictable with consistency 
these aspects include the incidences of illness or disease state eg  cardiac heart failure cases  cases of upper respiratory illness  diabetes  the number of full term versus premature births  and the number of neonatal intensive care babies as well as non medical aspects  such as changes in provider contracting and contractual benefits 
therefore  we must rely upon our historical experience  as continually monitored  to reflect the ever changing mix and growth of members 
monthly  we estimate our ibnr based on a number of factors  including prior claims experience  member mix changes  high dollar claims  and authorization data 
authorization data is information captured in our medical management system  which identifies services requested by providers or members 
the medical cost related to these authorizations is estimated by pricing the approved services using contractual or historical amounts adjusted for known variables such as historical claims trends 
these estimated costs are included as a component of ibnr in the more current months 
as part of our normal review  we consider the costs to process medical claims  and estimates of amounts to cover uncertainties related to fluctuations in claims payment patterns  membership  products and authorization trends 
these estimates are adjusted as more information becomes available and any adjustments are included in current operations 
due to the uncertainty associated with payment rates and inventory levels  associated with the facets conversion  we established a separate estimate for this uncertainty to cover the possibility of adverse claims development 
we will maintain this additional estimate as long as this uncertainty related to the systems conversion remains 
we utilize the services of independent actuarial consultants  to review our estimates on a quarterly basis  as well as the assumptions used in forming these estimates 
judgments are made based on knowledge and experience about past and current events 
there is a likelihood that actual results could be materially different than reported if different assumptions or conditions prevail 
also included in claims payable are estimates for provider settlements due to clarification of contract terms  out of network reimbursement and claims payment differences  as well as amounts due to or from contracted providers under risk sharing or other arrangements 
during  we reclassified certain provider receivables under our risk sharing arrangement with cchcn to prepaid expenses  provider receivables and other current assets as a result of the termination of the contract whereby no liabilities remained in claims payable to offset the risk sharing receivable 
the following table shows the components of the change in medical claims payable for the years ended december   and in thousands medical claims payable as of january medical claims payable assumed from businesses acquired during the year health benefits expenses incurred during the year related to current year related to prior years total incurred health benefits payments during the year related to current year related to prior years total payments medical claims payable as of december in the current year  we experienced an increase in the favorable prior year development of approximately million related to and prior which compares to a decrease of million in the prior year related to and prior 
the current year increase in favorable prior period development was primarily due to realized health benefits expense trends that were less than previously estimated 
the health benefits expenses incurred during the year related to prior years include favorable development related to the factor for uncertainty established in the prior year 
this may be offset by the establishment of a factor for uncertainty for adverse claims development when estimating claims payable related to the current year 
the company s methodology includes adding a factor to compensate for normal claims uncertainty 
the more precisely we have been able to predict claims patterns  the lower the required factor for uncertainty as a percentage of our medical liability 
due to the changing mix of members  products and markets  this factor is a necessary component of our medical liabilities 
while our prior year development historically has been favorable  there is no guarantee this will continue 
the factor for uncertainty mitigates the risk of emerging claims experience that is different from historical patterns 
the health benefits expenses incurred during the period related to prior years relate almost entirely to revisions in estimates for the immediately preceding year 
the application of our methodology has resulted in reversals of estimated incurred claims related to prior years in each of the years in the three year period ended december  the resulting impact on operations is a function of the variation of the change in estimate from year to year 
our factor for uncertainty increased in and by million  and million  respectively 
our factor for uncertainty decreased by million in changes in estimates are primarily the result of obtaining more complete claims information that directly correlates with the claims and provider reimbursement trends 
since our estimates are based upon the blended per member per month claims experience  changes cannot typically be explained by any single factor  but are the result of a number of interrelated variables  all influencing the resulting experience 
these variables include fluctuations in claims payment patterns  changes in membership levels  number and mix of products  benefit structure  changes in provider networks or contract terms  severity of illness and utilization levels 
absent a major acquisition  change in product mix  or expansion into new markets  we believe there will likely be less volatility as we increase in size and gain more maturity in our markets and successfully convert our remaining health plans to facets 
we believe that the amount of claims payable is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of december   however  actual claim payments and other items may differ from established estimates 
assuming a hypothetical difference between our december  estimates of claims payable and actual claims payable  our results of operations for the year ended december  would increase or decrease by approximately million net of related income tax effects and diluted earnings per share would increase or decrease by approximately per share 
income taxes on a quarterly basis  we estimate our required tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets 
our taxes payable are estimated based on enacted rates  including estimated tax rates in states where we do business  applied to the income expected to be taxed currently 
management assesses the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and management s projections for future taxable income 
we cannot guarantee that we will generate income in future years 
historically we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual 
goodwill and intangible assets as of december  and  we had goodwill and other intangible assets of million and million  respectively  net of accumulated amortization 
we review our intangible assets with defined lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate we might not recover their carrying value 
we assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future utility and cash flows and other internal and external factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
share based payments management s estimate of grant date fair value of the cost of employee services in share based payment transactions are based on results of a black scholes merton option pricing model adjusted for the unique characteristics of the company s share based payment instruments 
for the year ended december   assumptions used in estimating the fair value at date of grant were based on the following i 
the expected life of each award granted was calculated using the simplified method in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
ii 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility levels  and iii 
the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life 
recent accounting standards on july   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which is effective for the company on january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for a tax benefit to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by applicable taxing authorities 
the benefit recognized is the amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon final settlement of the tax position 
the cumulative effects of applying fin will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption 
based on our evaluation as of december   it is estimated that the company will record an adjustment to increase retained earnings by up to million

commitments as of december   the company has no commitments 
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries  which include hmos and one phsp 
hmos and phsps are subject to state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing  payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their stockholders 
additionally  certain state regulatory agencies may require individual regulated entities to maintain statutory capital levels higher than the state regulations 
as of december   we believe our subsidiaries are in compliance with all minimum statutory capital requirements

we believe as a result that we will continue to be in compliance with these requirements at least through the end of the national association of insurance commissioners naic has defined risk based capital rbc standards for hmos and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage that are designed to identify weakly capitalized companies by comparing each company s adjusted surplus to its required surplus rbc ratio 
the rbc ratio is designed to reflect the risk profile of hmos 
within certain ratio ranges  regulators have increasing authority to take action as the rbc ratio decreases 
there are four levels of regulatory action  ranging from requiring insurers to submit a comprehensive plan to the state insurance commissioner to requiring the state insurance commissioner to place the insurer under regulatory control 
at december   the rbc ratio of each of the company s health plans was at or above the level that would require regulatory action 
although not all states had adopted these rules at december   at that date  each of the company s active hmos had a surplus that exceeded either the applicable state net worth requirements or  where adopted  the levels that would require regulatory action under the naic s rbc rules 
inflation although the general rate of inflation has remained relatively stable and healthcare cost inflation has stabilized in recent years  the national healthcare cost inflation rate still exceeds the general inflation rate 
we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation 
specifically  our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through contracts with independent providers of healthcare services 
through these contracted care providers  our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements at december  include future minimum rental commitments of million 
we have no investments  loans or any other known contractual arrangements with special purpose entities  variable interest entities or financial partnerships
