item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general nobility s primary focus is homebuyers who generally purchase their manufactured homes from retail sales centers to locate on property they own 
nobility has aggressively pursued this market through its prestige retail sales centers 
while nobility actively seeks to make wholesale sales to independent retail dealers  its presence as a competitor limits potential sales to dealers located in the same geographic areas serviced by its prestige retail sales centers 
nobility has also aggressively targeted the retirement community market  which is made up of retirees moving to florida and typically purchasing homes to be located on sites leased from park communities offering a variety of amenities 
sales are not limited by the presence of the company s prestige retail sales centers in this type of arrangement  as the retirement community sells homes only within their community 
nobility has a product line of approximately active models 
although market demand can fluctuate on a fairly short term basis  the manufacturing process is such that nobility can alter its product mix relatively quickly in response to changes in the market 
during fiscal  and  nobility s product mix was affected by the number of special edition homes marketed by prestige and by larger  more expensive multi wide homes resulting from the availability of varied types of financing at competitive rates through our affiliates 
most family buyers today purchase three  four or five bedroom manufactured homes  compared with the two bedroom home that typically appeals to the retirement buyers who reside in the manufactured housing communities 
nobility s joint venture and finance revenue sharing agreement with st mortgage corporation and its subsidiaries provides mortgage financing to retail customers who purchase nobility s manufactured homes at prestige retail sales centers 
these agreements  which originate and service loans  have given prestige more control over the financing aspect of the retail home sales process and allowed it to offer better services to its retail customers 
management believes that these agreements give prestige an additional potential for profit by providing finance products to retail customers 
in addition  management believes that prestige has more input in the design of unique finance programs for prospective homebuyers  and that the joint venture has resulted in more profitable sales at its prestige retail sales centers 
for more information about the finance revenue sharing agreement  see note to the financial statements beginning on page in an effort to make manufactured homes more competitive with site built housing  financing packages are available to provide year financing  an interest rate reduction program  combination land manufactured home loans  and a down payment program for qualified buyers 
prestige also maintains several other outside financing sources that provide financing to retail homebuyers for its manufactured homes 
in the future  nobility may explore the possibility of underwriting its own mortgage loans for non st mortgage loans 
prestige s wholly owned subsidiary  mountain financial  inc  is an independent insurance agent and mortgage broker  provides mortgage brokerage services  automobile  extended warranty coverage and property and casualty insurance to prestige customers in connection with their purchase and financing of manufactured homes

critical accounting policies and estimates the company applies judgment and estimates  which may have a material effect in the eventual outcome of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  for accounts receivable  inventory and goodwill 
the following explains the basis and the procedure for each asset account where judgment and estimates are applied 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from its retail sales upon the occurrence of the following its receipt of a down payment  construction of the home is complete  home has been delivered and set up at the retail home buyer s site  and title has been transferred to the retail home buyer  remaining funds have been released by the finance company financed sales transaction  or cash has been received from the home buyer cash sales transaction  and completion of any other significant obligations 
the company recognizes revenues from its independent dealers upon receiving wholesale floor plan financing or establishing retail credit approval for terms  shipping of the home  and transferring title and risk of loss to the independent dealer 
for wholesale shipments to independent dealers  the company has no obligation to setup the home or to complete any other significant obligations 
the company recognizes revenues from its wholly owned subsidiary  mountain financial  inc  as follows commission income and fees in lieu of commissions is recorded as of the effective date of insurance coverage or the billing date  whichever is later 
commissions on premiums billed and collected directly by insurance companies are recorded as revenue when received which  in many cases  is the company s first notification of amounts earned due to the lack of policy and renewal information 
contingent commissions are recorded as revenue when received 
contingent commissions are commissions paid by insurance underwriters and are based on the estimated profit and or overall volume of business placed with the underwriter 
the data necessary for the calculation of contingent commissions cannot be reasonably obtained prior to the receipt of the commission which  in many cases  is the company s first notification of amounts earned 
the company provides appropriate reserves for policy cancellations based on numerous factors  including past transaction history with customers  historical experience  and other information  which is periodically evaluated and adjusted as deemed necessary 
in the opinion of management  no reserve is deemed necessary for policy cancellations at november  or november  investment in majestic majestic was formed in as a joint venture with our joint venture partner  an unrelated entity st mortgage corporation st mortgage 
we have been allocated our share of net income and distributions on a basis since majestic s formation 
while majestic has been deemed to be a variable interest entity  the company only holds a interest in this entity and all allocations of profit and loss are on a basis 
since all allocations are to be made on a basis and the company s maximum exposure is limited to it s investment in majestic  management has concluded that the company would not absorb a majority of majestic s expected losses nor receive a majority of majestic s expected residual returns  therefore  the company is not required to consolidate majestic with the accounts of nobility homes in accordance with fin r 
management believes that the company s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with majestic is its investment in the joint venture recorded in the accounts of nobility homes of  as of november  and  as of november  however  based on management s evaluation  there was no impairment of this investment at november  or november  the company is not obligated to repurchase any foreclosed repossessed units of majestic as it does not have a repurchase agreement or any other guarantees with majestic the company resells foreclosed repossessed units of majestic through the company s network of retail centers as we believe it benefits the historical loss experience of the joint venture 
we earn commissions from reselling such foreclosed repossessed units and have historically not recorded any material losses in connection with this activity 
finance revenue sharing agreement the finance revenue sharing agreement is between st mortgage corporation  prestige home centers  inc  and majestic homes  inc and no separate entity has been formed 
as a condition to the finance revenue sharing agreement  the company has agreed to repurchase homes from defaulted loans which were financed under the agreement 
however  the company has only minimal risk of loss 
no losses have been incurred in connection with the finance revenue sharing agreement 
goodwill between and the company acquired retail sales centers accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
as a result  goodwill is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets 
a valuation was performed by the company and it was determined that the estimated fair value of the goodwill in the accounts exceeded its book value 
there is no assurance that the value of the acquired sales centers will not decrease in the future due to changing business conditions 
vendor volume rebates the company receives volume rebates from its vendors based upon reaching a certain level of purchased materials during a specified period of time 
volume rebates are estimated based upon annual purchases  and are adjusted quarterly if the accrued volume rebate is applicable 
dealer volume rebate the company pays a volume rebate to independent dealers based upon the dollar volume of homes purchased and paid for by the dealer in excess of a certain specific dollar amount during a specific time period 
dealer volume rebates are accrued when sales are recognized
