item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
we are a diversified oil and gas industry supplier with three operating segments fluids systems and engineering  mat and integrated services  and environmental services 
we provide these products and services principally to the oil and gas exploration and production e p industry in the us gulf coast  west texas  us mid continent  us rocky mountains  canada  mexico  brazil and areas of europe and north africa surrounding the mediterranean sea 
further  we are expanding our presence outside the e p sector  particularly in mat and integrated services  where we are marketing to utilities  municipalities  and government sectors 
continuing operations revenues increased in to million due to higher drilling activity primarily in our fluids systems and engineering segment 
operating income before pre tax goodwill and long lived asset impairment charges was million 
this represented a increase from despite increases in general and administrative expenses during related to costs associated with the investigation of the accounting irregularities discovered in and the resulting restatement of the prior year financial statements 
loss from continuing operations in was million and was principally due to the impairment of million of goodwill and long lived assets in two of our reporting units in our environmental services segment 
net loss in was million primarily due to these impairment charges and losses associated with discontinued operations 
discontinued operations on august   our management with the approval of the executive committee of our board of directors determined to shut down the operations of newpark environmental water solutions  llc  which we refer to as news  and to dispose of  sell or redeploy all of the assets used in connection with its operations 
news was formed in early to commercialize in the united states and canada a proprietary and patented water treatment technology owned by a mexican company 
in connection with the shut down  we recognized  in the quarter ended september   a non cash pre tax impairment charge of million against the assets attributable to the water treatment business 
this impairment charge relates to the write down of investments in property  plant and equipment of approximately million and advances and other capitalized costs associated with certain agreements of approximately million 
as of december   all of the assets of news  along with certain assets related to disposal and water treatment operations in wyoming which existed prior to the start up of news  have been either abandoned or held for sale 
the related operations have been classified as discontinued operations since the operations ceased at those facilities as of december  this activity was previously recorded in the environmental services segment 
these discontinued operations had net losses of million and  in and  respectively 
in  these discontinued operations had net income of  if we are unable to sell the news assets  we may incur pre tax cash charges relating to cost of exiting this business of approximately million to million  which would be expensed as incurred 
hurricane impact during  we were able to recover from hurricanes katrina and rita which severely affected our fluids systems and engineering and environmental services operations along the us 
table of contents gulf coast in and early we recorded losses relating to property  plant and equipment damages totaling million and inventory losses totaling million in we also recorded additional costs totaling approximately  and million in and  respectively  as a direct result of the storms 
all of these costs were fully reimbursable by our insurers subject to deductibles 
in and  we recorded recoveries related to business interruption coverage related to the hurricanes of million and million  respectively  as reductions to cost of revenues 
we received insurance proceeds of million including million in reimbursement of losses on property  plant and equipment in in  we received insurance proceeds of million including million in reimbursement of losses on property  plant and equipment 
as of december   we had collected all insurance recoveries from our insurers 
all facilities damaged by the hurricanes currently have the capacity to operate at or near pre storm levels 
results of operations our operating results depend in large measure on oil and gas drilling activity levels in the markets we serve  as well as on the depth of drilling  which governs the revenue potential of each well 
these levels  in turn  depend on oil and gas commodities pricing  inventory levels and product demand 
rig count data is the most widely accepted indicator of drilling activity 
key average rig count data for the last three years ended december is as follows us rig count canadian rig count derived from baker hughes incorporated summarized financial information from continuing operations concerning our reportable segments is shown in the following table dollars in thousands years ended december  vs

drilling fluid sales and engineering north america mediterranean and south america total drilling fluid sales and engineering completion fluids and services industrial materials total north american drilling fluid sales and engineering revenues increased to million in overall north american rig activity increased during this period  while the average number of north american rigs serviced by this segment  namely the us gulf coast  us central region and canada  increased by only 
significant drivers of the revenue growth above rig count were market penetration in areas where new rigs are being deployed in our markets  the servicing of more complicated wells which generate higher revenues and improved pricing 
average revenue per rig  an indication of the complexity and depth of wells being serviced  increased in as compared to in  our mediterranean and south american revenues increased over these operations are realizing improvements as a result of continued focus on technology and performance 
these increases were driven by north african rig activity and additional segment infrastructure investment in this market 
revenues in our completion fluids and services business increased million  or  to million in  due to increased investment in the completion fluids business as well as increased market share and higher well completion activity 
revenues in our industrial materials market is principally associated with wholesale sales of barite and industrial minerals 
these revenues increased million in  or  as compared 
table of contents to as a result of higher demand for barite driven by the increased drilling activity in the us markets we serve 
operating income operating income for this segment increased million in on a million increase in revenues  compared to  representing an incremental operating margin of 
the operating margin for this segment in was  compared to in the increase in operating margin was principally due to operating leverage gained throughout the segment  a change in mix of revenues and business interruption insurance proceeds 
our completion fluids and services business  typically a higher margin business  had increased revenues of as compared to an increase in total revenue of 
our operating margin was favorably impacted by the final settlement of our business interruption coverage related to losses incurred as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita totaling million  which was recorded as a reduction of costs of revenues

installation re rental total us oilfield mat rental non oilfield mat rental canadian mat sales composite mat sales sawmill integrated services total us oilfield mat rental volume  measured in square feet  increased in compared to the average price per square foot decreased over total us oilfield mat rental revenues increased by million in  compared to  reflecting an increase in the larger number of installations in due to higher drilling activity 
revenues from non oilfield mat rentals  a premium margin market composed principally of seasonal utility and infrastructure construction markets  decreased the prior year revenues included revenues from a large one time utility job that occurred in the first quarter of canadian revenues  primarily related to the sales of wooden mats  increased million over this increase is due to increased demand during the first half of the year for our wooden mats in the western canada market and a large one time sale in the first quarter 
composite mat revenue decreased million from to million in primarily due to a decrease in the number of bravo mats sold 
we sold more durabase mats in than the revenue did not decrease proportionally as bravo average price per mat is significantly lower than the durabase average price per mat 
the decrease in the number of bravo mats is due to a large number of mats sold to the event industry in california in we 
table of contents continued to sell mats to this industry in  however  the industry did not require as large a quantity 
integrated services and other revenues  our lowest margin business unit for this segment  increased million in as compared to due to increased activity in production site maintenance and environmental services resulting from higher drilling activity 
operating income mat and integrated services operating income improved million in on a million increase in revenues  compared to this represents an incremental operating margin of 
operating margins increased to for as compared to in operating income was not fully impacted by the canadian mat sale revenue growth as we typically realize lower margins on that business 
this segment has been focusing on improving operating margins by lowering operating costs through the consolidation of five separate business units into one 
environmental services revenues total revenue for this segment consists of the following for and dollars in millions vs 
e p waste gulf coast e p waste other markets norm industrial total e p waste gulf coast revenues increased million  or  on a increase in waste volumes received offset by a decrease in average revenue per barrel 
the increase in waste volume is primarily due to the recovery from the disruption of operations in the third quarter of related to hurricanes katrina and rita 
the slight decrease in average revenue per barrel in the us gulf coast market in is due to fewer ancillary services being sold in the offshore and onshore markets 
operating income environmental services operating income increased million in on a million increase in revenues  compared to  representing a incremental operating margin 
operating margin of in was impacted positively by the final settlement of our business interruption recoveries related to losses incurred as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita totaling approximately  which was recorded as a reduction of cost of revenues 
operating margin for adjusted for the business interruption insurance is as compared to operating margin of 
the decline in adjusted operating margin in is principally due to cost increases which have not been fully offset by price increases 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased million to million in legal and accounting fees increased million 
these costs were related to the internal investigation conducted by our audit committee in  the resulting restatement of our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to and including december  and class action and derivative lawsuits filed relating to the restatement 
consulting fees increased million due to strategic 
table of contents planning  the evaluation of the news business  and computer software projects 
payroll  employee placement fees and other employee related costs increased million due to additional positions hired in our corporate office and the relocation of the corporate office 
stock based compensation increased million due to the implementation of fas r in finally  we had unfavorable experience in our self insured insurance programs of approximately  in versus we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will continue to be high in due to legal and other related costs associated with the class action and derivative lawsuits 
provision for uncollectible accounts the provision for uncollectible accounts increased  to million in as compared to  in this increase is primarily due to slower payments from some customers which have caused some accounts to become significantly past due 
we have reserved for these accounts in a manner consistent with our allowance policy which requires that we reserve on a specific identification basis when we believe that the required payment of specific amounts owed to us is not probable 
impairment losses in the fourth quarter of  we recorded goodwill impairment losses on the gulf coast and canadian reporting units in our environmental services segment totaling million 
we performed our goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests by estimating the fair value of our reporting units and other intangible assets 
we compared the estimated fair value of our reporting units with their respective carrying amounts and determined that our goodwill in our gulf coast and canadian reporting units was impaired 
the principal reasons giving rise to the impairment are reduced market multiples and reduced future expected cash flows resulting from increased competition and changes in the outlook of the regulatory environment 
for the same reasons stated above  we evaluated the recoverability of our long lived assets in our gulf coast reporting unit in our environmental services segment 
as a result of this evaluation  we also recorded an impairment charge on long lived assets totaling million 
the impairment was allocated as follows million to property  plant and equipment   to intangible assets  and  to other assets 
interest expense interest expense increased approximately million in compared to the increase in interest expense was partly related to the prepayment penalties of approximately  on the barite facilities financing   related to the unamortized balance of debt issuance costs related to the senior subordinated notes and the loss of approximately  on a rate swap agreement for our mediterranean operations 
the remaining increase in interest expense is due to an increase in the average debt outstanding as compared to as well as higher interest rates in provision for income taxes for  we recorded an income tax benefit of million  reflecting an income tax rate of 
this low effective rate is due to the impact of certain non deductible expenses  including a portion of the goodwill impairment 
for  we recorded an income tax provision of million  reflecting an income tax rate of 
the lower effective rate in reflects the favorable impact of changes in estimates  including estimated tax reserves  totaling approximately million 
these changes in estimates relate to finalization of canadian tax audits 
we expect the effective tax rate in to be between and

additionally  average revenue per rig  an indication of the complexity and depth of wells being serviced  increased 
we saw increased market penetration throughout our united states operations 
our canadian market increased due to increases in rig activity and the introduction of new drilling fluid systems 
revenues in the mediterranean and south american market increased during  compared to  principally related to increased market penetration in the north african locations that we service 
revenues in our completion fluids and services business increased million  or to million  in due to increased market penetration in the areas that we serve and higher well completion activity 
revenues in our industrial fluids market is principally associated with wholesale sales of barite and industrial minerals 
these revenues more than doubled during  compared to  due to the shortage of barite supplies in many us markets 

table of contents operating income operating income for this segment increased million in on a million increase in revenues  compared to the operating margin for this segment in was  compared to in the increase in operating margin was principally attributable to recent price increases and the operating leverage of this segment 
the increase in operating margin was partially offset by increased barite costs that have not been fully recovered through price increases to our customers during more favorable transportation arrangements have helped to stabilize barite costs 
mat and integrated services revenues total revenue for this segment consists of the following for and dollars in millions vs 
installation re rental total us oilfield mat rental non oilfield mat rental canadian mat sales composite mat sales sawmill integrated services total us oilfield mat rental volume for decreased from the average price per square foot increased over our oilfield mat rental pricing should continue to increase as market conditions improve 
any further improvement in revenue will be contingent upon increased utilization of our mat inventory  related in part to reductions in available mat inventory  and to improvements in market activity 
re rental revenues increased by million in  compared to  reflecting an increase in the number of larger installations in revenues from non oilfield mat rentals  a premium margin market composed principally of seasonal utility and infrastructure construction markets  increased  or 
most of this increase occurred in the first quarter of third quarter market conditions were hampered by four hurricanes affecting the southeastern region of the united states 
canadian revenues for and were related to sales of wooden mats 
the increase in wooden mat sales is principally due to the unusually early break up in western canada and continued acceptance of matting systems in this market as a means to improve the operating efficiency for our customers 
the increase in sales primarily occurred in the first half of total composite mat sales increased million for  as compared to the same period in recent increases in the number of bravo sales have helped to offset declines in the more expensive durabase mat sales 
during  we recognized approximately million in composite mat sales 
integrated services and other revenues  our lowest margin business unit for this segment  includes a comprehensive range of environmental services necessary for our customers oil and gas e p activities 

table of contents operating income mat and integrated services operating income improved million in on a million increase in revenues  compared to the significant increase in operating income reflects the benefit of cost reductions which began in  higher margin mat sales and the impact of improvement in pricing for our oilfield mat rental market 
environmental services revenues total revenue for this segment consists of the following for and dollars in millions vs 
e p waste gulf coast e p waste other markets norm industrial total e p waste gulf coast revenues increased  or  on a increase in average revenue per barrel offset in part by a decline in waste volumes received 
the decline in volumes received  in spite of the increase in gulf coast rig activity  includes the effect of temporary recycling process volume limitations affecting the first quarter of and the hurricanes in late during this time  we lost some market share 
the increase in gulf coast revenues was more than offset by lower revenues from the wyoming and western canadian market as resources and management focus were reallocated to development of the new water treatment business 
beginning in mid  we added additional management resources in the western canadian market and in the fourth quarter revenues and operating income began to improve 
operating income environmental services operating income declined  in on a million decrease in revenues  compared to general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased  to approximately million in  compared to the same period in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were in  compared to in impairment losses we recorded an impairment loss of million in the fourth quarter of due to the other than temporary impairment of an investment in convertible  redeemable preferred stock of a company that owns thermal desorption technology 
the company in which we had invested suffered an adverse judgment in a patent case and filed for protection under chapter bankruptcy proceedings 
in the fourth quarter of  the company was forced into conversion of its chapter proceedings to chapter bankruptcy proceedings by the plaintiff 
with no access to its equipment and the related operating cash flows due to this conversion  the company had to cease its operations 
table of contents in the fourth quarter of the impairment loss was recorded as the recovery of our investment was considered remote due to the impact of the chapter proceedings and other actions taken by the plaintiff during interest and other income interest and other income totaled  in  compared to million in during the second quarter of we collected the entire balance owed on a note receivable resulting from the sale of a former shipyard operation 
the payment included  of previously unaccrued interest related to the note receivable  which is included in interest income for we had ceased accrual on the note receivable in january due to the financial condition of the operator 
interest expense interest expense increased approximately million for compared to this increase was principally due to an increase in average outstanding debt during debt outstanding increased principally due to a million increase related to the consolidation of our mat manufacturing operations as a result of our purchase of the remaining interest in these operations in the second quarter of  a million increase related to the assumption of a lease in january from a joint venture which supplied a portion of our wooden mats and million in new financing for wooden mat additions 
the remainder of the increase in outstanding debt is related to funding of working capital in our mediterranean operations and funding of a portion of capital expenditures  including expenditures related to news 
provision for income taxes for  we recorded an income tax provision of million  reflecting an income tax rate of

the lower effective rate in reflects the favorable impact of changes in estimates  including estimated tax reserves  totaling approximately million 
these changes in estimates relate to final canadian tax audits 
liquidity and capital resources cash generated from operations during totaled million  including million of insurance proceeds resulting from claims associated with hurricanes katrina and rita 
we received additional insurance proceeds of million during for the reimbursement of losses on property  plant and equipment 
this cash  along with increased borrowings on our lines of credit of million and proceeds from option exercises of million  was used principally to fund capital expenditures of million 
included in the capital expenditures is million of replacement property  plant and equipment and million of assets related to news 
capital expenditures excluding news and hurricane expenditures totaled million  compared to million in depreciation 
we anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of million to million 
accounts receivable increased million to million as of december  due to increased sales in for the fourth quarter of  days sales in receivables improved three days to days  from days in the fourth quarter of we expect this metric to continue to improve as we implement measures to decrease collection times on outstanding receivables 
inventory turnover remained consistent at six times for and inventory levels increased million to million as of december  as compared to december  this increase is principally due to the increases in the price of barite as well as increased levels of 
table of contents barite as of december  additionally  as sales have increased  we have increased our inventory levels to meet demand 
we anticipate that our working capital requirements for will increase with the anticipated growth in revenue 
some of the increase in working capital requirements should be offset by our continued focus on improving our collection cycle 
however  we believe we have the ability to fund the expected increase in working capital 
our long term capitalization was as follows as of december long term debt term credit facility senior subordinated notes credit facility revolver credit facility term barite facilities financing other  primarily mat financing total long term debt stockholders equity total capitalization long term debt to long term capitalization in august  we entered into a term credit agreement which we refer to as the term credit facility 
this term credit facility  in the aggregate face amount of million  has a five year term and an initial interest rate of libor plus  based on our corporate family ratings by moody s and standard poor s 
effective january   the spread was lowered to 
the maturity date of the term credit facility is august  the term credit facility requires that we enter into  and thereafter maintain  interest rate management transactions  such as interest rate swap arrangements  to the extent necessary to provide that at least of the aggregate principal amount of the term credit facility is subject to either a fixed interest rate or interest rate protection for a period of not less than three years 
to comply with this requirement  we entered into an interest rate swap arrangement for the period from september  through march   which fixes the libor rate applicable to of the principal amount under the term credit facility at plus a spread based on our corporate family ratings by moody s and standard and poor s 
in addition  we entered into an interest rate cap arrangement that provides for a maximum libor rate of on the principal amount of million for the period from march  through september  we paid a fee of  for the interest rate cap arrangement  which is expected to be expensed during the period covered by the arrangement 
we made a draw down of the entire term credit facility on september   and partially used it to redeem our outstanding senior subordinated notes  which we refer to as the notes  in the principal amount of million plus accrued interest 
in addition  we repaid the barite facilities financing and the term portion of a prior revolving credit facility 
the term credit facility is a senior secured obligation of ours and is secured by first liens on all of our us tangible and intangible assets  excluding our accounts receivable and inventory  and by a second lien on us accounts receivable and inventory 
the term credit facility is callable at face value  except for a call premium if called at any time during the first year 
we make quarterly payments on the principal of the term credit facility of  we are also required to make an annual principal reduction equal to to of excess cash flow based on our consolidated leverage ratio 
we expect this payment to be approximately million for the year ended december  
table of contents in connection with the redemption of the notes and the payout of the other term debt  we expensed the unamortized balance of debt issuance costs related to these debt instruments which totaled approximately  in the third quarter of in addition  the prepayment of the barite facilities financing resulted in a prepayment penalty of  which also was recorded in the third quarter of in december  we entered into an agreement  which we refer to as the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is in the maximum aggregate face amount of million and matures on june  the revolving credit facility is secured by a first lien on our us accounts receivable and inventory and by a second lien on our us tangible and intangible assets 
availability under the revolving credit facility is based on a percentage of our eligible consolidated accounts receivable and inventory as defined in the revolving credit facility 
at december   the maximum amount we could borrow under the revolving credit facility was million 
at december   million in letters of credit were issued and outstanding and million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility  leaving million of availability at that date 
the revolving credit facility bears interest at either a specified prime rate at december   or the three month libor rate at december  plus a spread determined quarterly based upon the amount of the prior quarter average availability under the revolving credit facility 
the weighted average interest rates on the outstanding balances under the credit facilities for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
both the term credit facility and revolving credit facility contain a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant and a debt to ebitda ratio 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants contained in these facilities 
the term credit facility and the revolving credit facility also contain covenants that significantly limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock  incur additional debt and repurchase our common stock 
ava  spa  our european fluid systems and engineering subsidiary  which we refer to as ava  maintains its own credit arrangements  consisting primarily of lines of credit with several banks  with the lines renewed on an annual basis 
advances under these short term credit arrangements are typically based on a percentage of ava s accounts receivable or firm contracts with certain customers 
the weighted average interest rate under these arrangements was at december  as of december   ava had a total of million outstanding under these facilities  including approximately  reported in long term debt 
we do not provide a corporate guaranty of ava s debt 
as of december   ava had a swap arrangement in which ava received a floating rate from a bank and paid a rate which varied based on inflation 
under the terms of the swap  ava receives an annual payment from the bank based on a euro notional amount of million times the euribor rate in effect as of the end of the determination period  and pays an annual amount to the bank based on the notional amount times a rate which varies according to both the euribor rate and the published inflation rate for the euro area 
this arrangement requires annual settlements and matures in february during  we entered into a secured financing facility which provides up to million in financing for wooden mat additions 
at december   we had borrowed million under the facility 
principal payments totaling approximately  are required monthly for months 
interest based on one month libor plus is also payable monthly 
with respect to additional off balance sheet liabilities  we lease most of our office and warehouse space  barges  rolling stock and certain pieces of operating equipment under operating leases 

table of contents except as described in the preceding paragraphs  we are not aware of any material expenditures  significant balloon payments or other payments on long term obligations or any other demands or commitments  including off balance sheet items to be incurred within the next months 
inflation has not materially impacted our revenues or income 
a summary of our outstanding contractual and other obligations and commitments at december  is as follows in millions payments due by period total less than year years years after years long term debt and capital leases foreign bank lines of credit interest on debt obligations operating leases trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities reflected in balance sheet purchase commitments  not accrued other long term liabilities reflected in balance sheet performance bond obligations standby letter of credit commitments not included elsewhere total contractual obligations includes purchase order commitments for barite inventory including  secured by standby letters of credit not received as of december  we anticipate that the obligations and commitments listed above that are due in less than one year will be paid from operating cash flows 
subsequent event in february following a comprehensive review of all of our businesses  we decided to explore strategic alternatives with regards to our environmental services business  including the potential sale of this business 
this decision is part of our newly developed strategic plan to focus our attention and capital on our fluids systems and engineering and mat and integrated services businesses 
it is in these two segments where we believe there is a greater opportunity for earnings growth 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  which requires us to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments related to uncollectible accounts and notes receivable  inventory  impairments of long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles and our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that are believed to be reasonable 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material 
we believe the critical accounting policies described below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and notes receivable are determined on a specific identification basis when we believe that the required payment of specific amounts owed to us is not probable 
for notes receivable  our judgments with respect to collectibility include evaluating any underlying collateral 
the majority of our revenues are from mid sized and international oil companies and government owned or government controlled oil companies  and we have receivables in several foreign jurisdictions 
changes in oil and gas drilling activity or changes in economic conditions in foreign jurisdictions could cause our customers to be unable to repay these receivables  resulting in additional allowances 
since amounts due from individual customers can be significant  future adjustments to the allowance could be material 
inventory reserves for inventory obsolescence are determined based on fair value of the inventory using factors such as our historical usage of inventory on hand  future expectations related to our customers needs  market conditions and the development of new products 
changes in oil and gas drilling activity and the development of new technologies associated with the drilling industry could require additional allowances to reduce the value of inventory to the lower of its cost or net realizable value 
impairments our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes goodwill and other intangible assets  net of amortization  totalling million 
this amount has principally been recorded as a result of business combinations 
the decrease in goodwill and other intangible assets from december  is principally due to recognition of the impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets in the environmental services segment of million discussed previously 
in addition  our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes property  plant and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  of million 
as previously discussed  in we recorded an impairment charge of million on property  plant and equipment in our environmental services segment 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill  intangible assets and property  plant and equipment  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded for these assets 
we perform goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests on an annual basis or when facts and circumstances warrant a review 
a significant amount of judgment is required in performing goodwill and other intangible assets impairment tests 
these tests include estimating the fair value of our reporting units and other intangible assets 
with respect to goodwill  we compare the estimated fair value of our reporting units with their respective carrying amounts  including goodwill 
under financial accounting standard fas  fair value refers to the amount for which the entire reporting unit may be bought or sold 
our methods for estimating reporting unit fair values include discounted cash flows and multiples of earnings 
we typically identify our reporting units based on geographic markets within each of our business segments 
we perform property  plant and equipment and other long lived asset impairment tests 
in accordance with fas  impairments are calculated based on a future cash flow concept 
in estimating our expected future cash flows  we use a probability weighted approach 
we assess the impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets  property  plant and equipment and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

table of contents when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable  any impairment is calculated and recorded as an impairment loss 
income taxes we have net deferred tax assets of million at december  a valuation allowance must be established to offset a deferred tax asset if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december   we had recorded a valuation allowance for all state nols and for nols generated during start up operations of certain of our foreign operations 
we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for our valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period this determination was made

fin applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of fin and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  based on our preliminary evaluation  we do not expect adoption of fin to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency rates 
a discussion of our primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below 
interest rate risk our policy historically has been to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
at december   we had total debt outstanding of million  all of which is subject to variable rate terms 
our term credit agreement requires that we enter into  and thereafter maintain  interest rate management transactions  such as interest rate swap arrangements  to the extent necessary to provide that at least of the aggregate principal amount of the term credit facility is subject to either a fixed interest rate or interest rate protection for a period of not less than three years 
to satisfy this requirement  we entered into an interest rate swap arrangement for the period from september  through march   which fixes the libor rate applicable to of the principle amount under the term credit facility at plus a spread based on our corporate family ratings by moody s and standard poor s 
in addition  we entered into an interest rate cap arrangement that provides for a maximum libor rate of on the principal amount of million for the period from march  through september  we paid a fee of  for the interest rate cap arrangement 
through this swap arrangement  we have effectively fixed the interest rate on million  or  of our total debt outstanding as of december  
table of contents the fair value of the term credit facility totaled million at december   as compared to the recorded balance of million 
the fair value of the interest rate swap is a  liability as of december  the fair value of the interest rate cap is  as of december  as compared to the original cost of  as of december   ava  spa  our european fluids systems and engineering subsidiary  which we refer to as ava  had a swap arrangement in which ava received a floating rate from a bank and paid a rate which varied based on inflation 
under the terms of the swap  ava receives an annual payment from the bank based on a euro notional amount of million times the euribor rate in effect as of the end of the determination period  and pays an annual amount to the bank based on the notional amount times a rate which varies according to both the euribor rate and the published inflation rate for the euro area
