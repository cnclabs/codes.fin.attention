critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  warranty obligations  goodwill and intangible asset valuation  stock based compensation and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company s policy is to recognize revenue for product sales when evidence of an arrangement exists  sales price is determinable or fixed  title transfers and risk of loss has passed to the customer  which is generally upon shipment of our products to our customers 
the company defers and recognizes service revenue over the contractual period or as services are rendered 
some distributor agreements allow for potential return of products and provide price protection under certain conditions within limited time periods 
such return rights are generally limited to short term stock rotation 
the company estimates sales returns and price adjustments based upon historical experience and other qualitative factors 
the company estimates expected sales returns and price adjustments and records the amounts as a reduction of revenue at the later of the time of shipment or when the pricing decision is made 
each period  price protection is estimated based upon pricing decisions made and information received from distributors as to the amount of inventory they are holding 
the company s policies comply with the guidance provided by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  issued by the securities and exchange commission 
judgments are required in evaluating the credit worthiness of our customers 
credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until the company has determined that the collection risk is minimal 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  the company obtains credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer when determining or modifying their credit limits 
the company regularly evaluates the collectibility of its trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account balance becomes past due  the company initiates dialogue with the customer to determine the cause 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to the company  such as in the case of bankruptcy  deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business  the company records a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company expects to recover 
the company also records an allowance for all customers based on certain other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due  the amount outstanding  and historical collection experience with customers 
the company believes its reported allowances are adequate 
however  if the financial condition of those customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  the company may need to record additional allowances which would result in additional general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination was made 
inventory 
the company is exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of its inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage  or subject to lower of cost or market issues 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological and regulatory changes in the company s markets  the company s ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  forecasting errors  new product introductions  quality issues with key suppliers  product phase outs  future customer service and repair requirements  and the availability of key components from the company s suppliers 
the company s policy is to reduce the value of inventory when conditions exist that suggest that its inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon its assumptions about future demand for its products and market conditions 
the company regularly evaluates its ability to realize the value of its inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
purchasing practices and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  the company s adjustments are intended to reduce the carrying value of its inventory to its net realizable value 
if actual demand for the company s products deteriorates or market conditions become less favorable than those that the company projects  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
product warranties 
the company s products are sold with warranty provisions that require it to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance over a specified period of time  generally between and months  at no cost to the company s customers 
the company s policy is to establish warranty reserves at levels that represent its estimate of the costs that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements at the time that revenue is recognized 
the company believes that its recorded liabilities are adequate to cover its future cost of materials  labor and overhead for the servicing of its products 
if product failure rates  or material or service delivery costs differ from the company s estimates  its warranty liability would need to be revised accordingly 
intangible assets 
the company adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on accounting for business combinations and goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal year accordingly  the company no longer amortizes goodwill from acquisitions  but continues to amortize other acquisition related intangibles and costs 
as required by these rules  the company performs an impairment review of goodwill annually or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
this annual impairment review was completed during the second quarter of fiscal year for the goodwill associated with the medical and industrial business units and in the fourth quarter of fiscal year for the goodwill associated with the control room and digital signage business unit 
neither analysis indicated an impairment 
the impairment review was based on a discounted cash flow approach that used estimates of future market share and revenues and costs for the relevant segments as well as appropriate discount rates 
the estimates used were consistent with the plans and estimates that the company uses to manage the underlying businesses 
in the future  if the company fails to deliver new products for these groups  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance  or if market conditions in the related businesses become unfavorable  revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and the company may incur further charges for impairment of goodwill 
for identifiable intangible assets  the company amortizes the cost over the estimated useful life and assesses any impairment by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows from the associated asset in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
based upon impairment analyses performed in fiscal  an impairment charge was recorded see additional discussion in notes and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
if the estimated cash flow related to these assets decreases in the future or the useful life is shorter than originally estimated  the company may incur further charges for impairment of these assets 
additional impairment could result if the associated products do not sell as expected 
share based compensation expense 
on october   the company adopted fas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock options  restricted stock and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan  based on estimated fair values 
upon adoption of fas r  the company maintained its method of valuation of share based awards using the black scholes option pricing model  which has historically been used for the purpose of the pro forma financial information in accordance with fas the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding the risk free interest rate  the expected dividend yield  the expected option life  and expected volatility over the term of the awards 
the company estimates volatility based on its historical stock price volatility for a period consistent with the expected life of its options 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the company s employee stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on the company s history and expectation of dividend payouts 
the expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding based on historical experience 
as share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
fas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical and anticipated future experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of fas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under fas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
income taxes 
the company records a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
if the company is able to realize the deferred tax assets in an amount in excess of its reported net amounts  an adjustment to decrease the valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets would decrease goodwill or increase earnings in the period such a determination was made 
similarly  if the company should determine that its net deferred tax assets may not be realized to the extent reported  an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance associated with the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such a determination was made 
business acquisitions in september  the company completed the acquisition of clarity visual systems  inc clarity 
clarity is engaged in the design  development  manufacturing  marketing  distribution  support  and maintenance of large screen display systems for entertainment  business  and retail market applications 
as a result of the acquisition  the company is able to broaden its product offerings in the specialized display market segments 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the operations of clarity have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition
