item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with those statements and notes thereto 
this report contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including the following the planned opening of to american eagle stores in the united states and canada  at least aerie stand alone stores and approximately martin osa stores in the united states during fiscal the selection of approximately american eagle stores in the united states for remodeling during fiscal  the completion of improvements and expansion at our distribution centers  the completion of the construction of our new corporate headquarters and data center  the success of our new brand concept  martin osa  the success of our new intimates sub brand  aerie by american eagle  the expected payment of a dividend in future periods  and the possibility of growth through acquisitions and or internally developing additional new brands 
page annual report we caution that these forward looking statements  and those described elsewhere in this report  involve material risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on factors beyond our control  as discussed within part i  item a of this form k 
accordingly  our future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forward looking statement 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations should actual results differ 
we base our estimates and assumptions on the best available information and believe them to be reasonable for the circumstances 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board 
revenue recognition 
we record revenue for store sales upon the purchase of merchandise by customers 
our e commerce operation records revenue upon the estimated customer receipt date of the merchandise 
revenue is not recorded on the purchase of gift cards 
a current liability is recorded upon purchase and revenue is recognized when the gift card is redeemed for merchandise 
revenue is recorded net of estimated and actual sales returns and deductions for coupon redemptions and other promotions 
the estimated sales return reserve is based on projected merchandise returns determined through the use of historical average return percentages 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our sales return reserve 
however  if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly  our operating results could be adversely affected 
during fiscal  we reviewed our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and determined that shipping and handling amounts billed to customers  which were historically recorded as a reduction to cost of sales  should be recorded as revenue 
accordingly  these amounts are recorded within net sales 
prior year amounts were reclassified for comparative purposes 
during the three months ended october   we began recording sell offs of end of season  overstock and irregular merchandise on a gross basis  with proceeds and cost of sell offs recorded in net sales and cost of sales  respectively 
historically  we presented the proceeds and cost of sell offs on a net basis within cost of sales 
amounts for prior periods were not adjusted to reflect this change as the amounts were deemed to be immaterial 
merchandise inventory 
merchandise inventory is valued at the lower of average cost or market  utilizing the retail method 
average cost includes merchandise design and sourcing costs and related expenses 
we review our inventory in order to identify slow moving merchandise and generally use markdowns to clear merchandise 
additionally  we estimate a markdown reserve for future planned markdowns related to current inventory 
if inventory exceeds customer demand for reasons of style  seasonal adaptation  changes in customer preference  lack of consumer acceptance of fashion items  competition  or if it is determined that the inventory in stock will not sell at its currently ticketed price  additional markdowns may be necessary 
these markdowns may have a material adverse impact on earnings  depending on the extent and amount of inventory affected 
we estimate an inventory shrinkage reserve for anticipated losses for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
the estimate for the shrinkage reserve is calculated based on historical percentages and can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory shrinkage reserve 
however  if actual physical inventory losses differ significantly from our estimate  our operating results could be adversely affected 
american eagle outfitters page asset impairment 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted future cash flows of the asset to the carrying value 
if the future cash flows are projected to be less than the carrying value of the asset  we adjust the asset value to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our impairment loss calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  our operating results could be adversely affected 
share based payments 
we account for share based payments in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
to determine the fair value of our stock option awards  we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires management to apply judgment and make assumptions to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them the expected term  the estimated volatility of the price of our common stock over the expected term and an estimate of the number of options that will ultimately be forfeited 
we calculate a weighted average expected term using the simplified method as permitted by staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payment sab no 

the simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of the vesting term and original contractual term of the options 
expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility 
we chose to use a combination of historical and implied volatility as we believe that this combination is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility alone 
estimated forfeitures are calculated based on historical experience 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of our share based payments and the related amount recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
we calculate income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates  based on certain judgments regarding enacted tax laws and published guidance  in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred taxes may not be realized 
changes in our level and composition of earnings  tax laws or the deferred tax valuation allowance  as well as the results of tax audits may materially impact our effective tax rate 
both the calculation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as the decision to establish a valuation allowance require management to make estimates and assumptions 
although we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates and assumptions used  if actual results are not consistent with the estimates and assumptions  the balances of the deferred tax assets  liabilities and valuation allowance could be adversely affected 
page annual report key performance indicators our management evaluates the following items  which are considered key performance indicators  in assessing our performance comparable store sales comparable store sales provide a measure of sales growth for stores open at least one year 
a store is included in comparable store sales in the thirteenth month of operation 
however  stores that have a gross square footage increase of or greater due to a remodel are removed from the comparable store sales base  but are included in total sales 
these stores are returned to the comparable store sales base in the thirteenth month following the remodel 
management considers comparable store sales to be an important indicator of our current performance 
comparable store sales results are important in achieving leveraging of our costs  including store payroll  store supplies  rent  etc 
positive comparable store sales contribute to greater leveraging of costs while negative comparable store sales contribute to deleveraging of costs 
comparable store sales also have a direct impact on our total net sales  cash and working capital 
gross profit gross profit measures whether we are appropriately optimizing the price and inventory levels of our merchandise 
gross profit is the difference between net sales and cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of merchandise costs  including design  sourcing  importing and inbound freight costs  as well as markdowns  shrinkage  certain promotional costs and buying  occupancy and warehousing costs 
buying  occupancy and warehousing costs consist of compensation  employee benefit expenses and travel for our buyers and certain senior merchandising executives  rent and utilities related to our stores  corporate headquarters  distribution centers and other office space  freight from our distribution centers to the stores  compensation and supplies for our distribution centers  including purchasing  receiving and inspection costs  and shipping and handling costs related to our e commerce operation 
any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups or any significant increase in our use of markdowns could have an adverse effect on our gross profit and results of operations 
operating income management views operating income as a key indicator of our success 
the key drivers of operating income are comparable store sales  gross profit and our ability to control selling  general and administrative expenses 
store productivity store productivity  including net sales per average square foot  sales per productive hour  average unit retail price  conversion rate  the number of transactions per store  the number of units sold per store and the number of units per transaction  is evaluated by management in assessing our operational performance 
inventory turnover management evaluates inventory turnover as a measure of how productively inventory is bought and sold 
inventory turnover is important as it can signal slow moving inventory 
this can be critical in determining the need to take markdowns on merchandise 
cash flow and liquidity management evaluates cash flow from operations  investing and financing in determining the sufficiency of our cash position 
cash flow from operations has historically been sufficient to cover our uses of cash 
management believes that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements

our results were driven by our on going customer focus  the depth of talent within our teams and a company wide commitment to strong operating disciplines

impact of inflation deflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant effect on our net sales or our profitability

additionally  while deflation could positively impact our merchandise costs  it could have an adverse effect on our average unit retail price  resulting in lower sales and profitability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have market risk exposure related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is measured as the potential negative impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates over the next year 
interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on cash equivalents and investments 
the impact on cash and investments held at the end of fiscal from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would have been a decrease in net income of approximately million during fiscal foreign exchange rate risk we are exposed to the impact of foreign exchange rate risk primarily through our canadian operations where the functional currency is the canadian dollar 
the recent weakening of the us dollar compared to the canadian dollar has positively impacted our net sales and any operating income generated by our canadian businesses 
as of february   a change in the canadian foreign exchange rate would have resulted in an increase or decrease in net income of approximately million during fiscal page annual report
