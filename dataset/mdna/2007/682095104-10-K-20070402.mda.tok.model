we were involved in a putative class action litigation filed in the clark county circuit court  in arkansas  alleging that our corrugated stainless steel tubing product  tracpipe and similar products manufactured by several other manufacturers also named as defendants in the case was defective against potential damage caused by the nearby lightning strikes 
on september   we entered into a stipulation and settlement agreement with the class representatives and class counsel  to settle and resolve the allegations brought forth in the lawsuit 
we and the other defendants deny all of the allegations in the lawsuit  and deny any wrongdoing or legal liability  but agreed to settle this matter to avoid further cost and the uncertainty and risk of the outcome of further litigation 
the settlement agreement provides a a release of all claims brought by class representatives for themselves and for the class against the defendants in the lawsuit  b notice to the class of the settlement and a remedial program for all class members  c certain marketing measures by the defendants  and d payment of attorneys fees to the class counsel 
a copy of the settlement agreement has been filed as an exhibit to the current report on form k that we filed with the securities and exchange commission on september   and is available on the sec website at www

the court gave final approval to the settlement agreement on february  the remedial program provided under the settlement agreement is currently processing claims from class members as provided under the settlement agreement 
the deadline for submitting such claims is september  we are currently engaged in a case to protect our intellectual property rights 
we have sued a flexible gas pipe competitor for infringement on one or more of our us patents covering our autoflare fittings 
we have alleged that the competitor has infringed on one or more of our patents covering the autoflare fittings by including certain patented features in the competitor s fitting  including a locator sleeve that makes it easier to align the connection 
the trial court has ruled that the competitor did infringe on one or more of our autoflare patents  and that the autoflare patents are valid 
the case is now scheduled for a trial to determine the amount of damages for the infringement  and a decision on the damages trial is expected in the nd quarter of however  the defendant has filed an appeal from the trial court ruling on the validity of one or more of our autoflare patents  and that appeal is currently pending 
a decision from the appellate court may be issued in the latter part of  and an adverse ruling could reverse one or more parts of the trial court decision 
in another case that was pending in the court of common pleas in chester county  pennsylvania  we sued a former employee and a flexible metal hose competitor to enjoin the disclosure of our trade secrets covering our proprietary rotary manufacturing process 
in this case  a former long term employee left our company to work for a competitor who is engaged in the flexible metal hose market 
the former employee had been involved in the development and or refinement of aspects of the rotary process manufacturing method  and had detailed knowledge of our trade secrets concerning this manufacturing method 
we filed suit to enjoin any disclosure of our trade secrets by the former employee to his new employer  to enforce certain terms of an employment agreement previously signed by the former employee  and to obtain damages for any unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of our trade secrets 
the case went to trial in march  and the court issued its decision in july  ruling that our proprietary rotary process for manufacturing corrugated stainless steel tubing was a trade secret under pennsylvania law  and was to be accorded protection against unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation 
the defendants were permanently enjoined from disclosing the trade secrets  or using the trade secrets in their business 
at trial  we did not bring a claim for monetary damages  and no monetary damages were awarded by the court

overview as disclosed in item under the caption development of business  the company is a former subsidiary of mestek  inc on july   mestek  inc effected a distribution of its ownership of the company s common stock to the mestek record shareholders 
this distribution was preceded by the filing on july  of a definitive registration statement of the company s common stock on form with the securities and exchange commission 
the company s common shares began trading on the nasdaq global market formerly known as the nasdaq national market under the trading symbol oflx on august  certain effects of the distribution are reflected in the changes of financial condition of the company for the year ended december  the company is a leading manufacturer of flexible metal hose  and is currently engaged in a number of different markets  including construction  manufacturing  transportation  petrochemical  pharmaceutical and other industries 
the company s business is controlled as a single operating segment that consists of the manufacture and sale of flexible metal hose and accessories 
the company s products are concentrated in residential and commercial construction  and general industrial markets 
the company s primary product line  tracpipe flexible gas piping  is used for gas piping within residential and commercial buildings 
through its flexibility and ease of use with patented fittings distributed under the trademark autoflare  the tracpipe flexible gas piping allows users to substantially cut the time required to install the gas piping  as compared to traditional methods 
all of the company s hose products are manufactured at the company s exton  pennsylvania facility 
a majority of the company s sales across all industries are generated through independent outside sales organizations such as sales representatives  wholesalers and distributors  or a combination of both 
the company has a broad distribution network in north america and to a lesser extent in other global markets 
non gaap financial measures return on average net assets employed   and the following analysis of the company s results of operations focuses on the relationship of core operating profits  a non gaap financial measure  as defined below  to average net assets employed  as defined below 
management believes this focus  which is essentially an enterprise value point of view  is more useful to investors as it isolates and relates the company s ongoing pre tax  pre interest  operating earnings to the total capital invested  whether debt or equity capital 
the company s operating profits in  and  as reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  included non cash stock based compensation charges of   and  respectively  that relate to the put rights of two of the company s principal executive officers who are also shareholders of omega flex which potentially obligated the company to repurchase the officer s option shares at book value 
effective with the date of spin off  the put rights were cancelled and the balance of the put obligation   was converted to paid in capital 
the company s operating profits for  and as reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  also included   and  respectively  for legal expenses in connection with the arkansas litigation matter in which the company is engaged  as more fully discussed in note to the financial statements 
core operating profits  as the term is used herein  is defined as operating profits determined in accordance with gaap  as reflected in the accompanying financial statements  plus the aforementioned non cash stock based compensation charges and non recurring legal expenses 
core operating profits as defined above represents a non gaap financial measure which is reconcilable with the comparable gaap financial measure  operating profits  as follows in thousands operating profits comparable gaap financial measure plus non cash stock based compensation and non recurring legal expenses core operating profits non gaap financial measure the company s return on average net assets employed  defined as core operating profits  over average net assets employed from continuing operations total assets less current and non current liabilities other than current and non current portions of long term debt averaged over months for the years   and was as follows in thousands core operating profits non gaap financial measure average net assets employed from continuing operations return on average net assets employed annualized the slight dip in overall return on average net assets employed from in to in is reflected in the following themes the company s average net assets employed anae increased from to the increase in anae is principally due to the purchase of the company s manufacturing facility in april of  which has a current carrying value of million 
in addition  the company had an increase in working capital driven by the sales increase of over the same year period  principally in the tracpipe flexible gas piping product  as more fully described under results of operations 
core operating profits increased during the year period largely offsetting the increase in anae 
this increase to core operating profits was principally derived from our ability to sustain higher levels of growth without adding commensurate continuing resource costs  increased levels of sales  enhanced purchasing efficiencies  and our ability to effectively gain productivity increases at the higher volumes 
our abilities to effectively manage existing costs by gaining higher levels of manufacturing efficiencies  coupled with enhanced purchasing practices  also as more fully described under results of operations further diminished the effects of the increase in anae 
changes in financial condition on april   the company paid the remaining outstanding principal balance and accrued interest of  million on the mortgage note that was obtained from sovereign bank in the balance at december  was  on september  the company entered into a stipulation and settlement agreement with the class representatives and class counsel  to settle and resolve the allegations brought forth in the lawsuit titled lovelis  et al 
v 
titeflex  inc  et al

the company estimates that the total amount of the liability relating to the settlement of the litigation will fall within a range of million and million 
accordingly  the company recorded a pre tax charge to operations of approximately million in the third quarter of this amount is based on currently available information and certain estimates and judgments  and is subject to revision as actual claims are received  and a claim history is established 
the court gave final approval to the settlement agreement on february  refer to note for a detailed description of the settlement 
on december  the board of directors authorized a special dividend of per share to all shareholders of record as of january   and payable as soon as practicable

the company reported comparative results from continuing operations for and as follows net sales gross profit core operating profits a non gaap financial measure average net assets employed anae return on anae the company s sales increased  from  in as compared to  in due to continued strong sales of the company s flagship tracpipe flexible gas piping product and its patented autoflare connection system 
tracpipe is a corrugated stainless steel tubing product developed especially for use in the piping of fuel gas lines within residential and commercial buildings 
although sales in to established contractors in the residential construction sector may have been affected by the current weakening of the residential market  overall sales of tracpipe flexible gas piping were sustained by conversion of competitive products in the company s largest market residential construction  and strategic initiatives resulting in accelerating sales in the commercial market 
of the  increase in sales from to  approximately two thirds of such increases were a result of price increases to address rapidly increasing raw material costs with the remainder due to increases in sales volume 
the company s gross profit margins increased from in to in indicative of management s ability to find manufacturing efficiencies and effectively price our products despite inflationary pressures effecting stainless steel and other commodities

for the year  the company s effective income tax rate varied slightly from the statutory rates for both federal and state taxes due primarily to limitations on deductions related to incentive stock options 
for the year  the effective tax rate was equal to the statutory rate 
commitments and contingencies commitments on september  the company entered into a stipulation and settlement agreement with the class representatives and class counsel  to settle and resolve the allegations brought forth in the lawsuit titled lovelis  et al 
v 
titeflex  inc  et al 
in the arkansas circuit court  clark county 
all of the other defendants in the case also signed the settlement agreement 
the lawsuit relates to allegations that the company s csst products posed an unreasonable risk of fire due to lightning strikes 
both the company and the other defendants deny these allegations  and deny any wrongdoing or legal liability  but have agreed to settle this matter to avoid further cost and the uncertainty and risk of the outcome of further litigation 
the court gave final approval to the settlement agreement on february  the remedial program provided under the settlement agreement is currently processing claims from class members 
the deadline for submitting any claims is september  under the settlement agreement  the company has agreed to pay the value of each payment voucher redeemed by a class member for the installation of a lightning protection system or bonding and grounding of the company s csst product 
the amount of the voucher is dependent on the geographical area in the united states where the building is located and the size of the heated or air conditioned area of the building  as set forth in the settlement agreement 
the company has also agreed to pay a fixed amount of administrative expenses in providing notice to the class  and establishing and operating a claim system under which class members may obtain information  submit claims  and have claims processed 
finally  the company has agreed to pay attorneys fees to the class counsel to resolve this matter 
the company cannot determine the exact amount for which it may be liable for the costs of the payment vouchers tendered under the claim program because of the number of unknown variables associated with this liability  including  the number of buildings in the united states that contain the company s csst product  the number of payment vouchers that are properly and timely submitted by claimants  the extent to which vouchers are for lightning protection systems or for bonding and grounding  the geographical location of the building within the united states  and the size of the building in which the csst is located 
however  the company estimates that the total amount of the liability relating to the settlement of the litigation will fall within a range of million and million 
accordingly  the company recorded a pre tax charge to operations of approximately million in the third quarter of this amount is based on currently available information and certain estimates and judgments  and is subject to revision as actual claims are received  and a claim history is established 
the company is obligated under indemnity agreements executed on behalf of of the company s officers and directors 
under the terms of the agreement  the company is contingently liable for costs which may be incurred by the officers and directors in connection with claims arising by reason of these individuals roles as officers and directors 
as of december   the company was a guarantor of the debt of its wholly owned subsidiary  exton ranch  inc  related to the mortgage note established on april  with sovereign bank for the purchase of the company s main operating facility in exton  pennsylvania 
however  on april   the company paid the entire outstanding principal balance and accrued interest of the million mortgage note that was obtained from sovereign bank in the company has entered into salary continuation agreements with two employees which provide for monthly payments to each of the employee or his designated beneficiary upon the employee s retirement or death 
the payment benefits range from  per month to  per month with the term of such payments limited to years after the employee s retirement at age the agreements also provide for survivorship benefits if the employee dies before attaining age  and severance payments if the employee is terminated without cause  the amount of which is dependent on the length of company service at the date of termination 
the net present value of the retirement payments is included in other long term liabilities 
the company has obtained and is the beneficiary of two whole life insurance policies in respect of the two employees  and the cash surrender value of such policies included in other assets exceeds the net present value of the company s obligations for the retirement payments at december  contingencies the company retains significant obligations under its commercial insurance policies for losses occurring in the policy years in which it was a subsidiary of mestek  inc for the policy year ending october   the company retained liability for the first  per occurrence of commercial general liability claims including product liability claims  subject to an agreed aggregate 
for losses occurring in the policy year ended october   the company retained liability for the first  per occurrence of commercial general liability claims including product liability claims  subject to an agreed aggregate 
in addition  for and the company retained liability for the first  per occurrence of workers compensation coverage  subject to an agreed aggregate 
however  for policy years beginning on july  the effective date of the spin off  the company retained liability for the first  per occurrence of commercial liability claims including products liability claims  subject to an agreed aggregate  and the company is currently insured on a first dollar basis for workers compensation subject to statutory limits 
the company maintains reserves for its obligations under these various policies based on claim experience and the reserves established by the insurers in relation to these claims 
the reserve balances at december  and december  were not material in amount 
prior to the spin off  the company self insured a substantial portion of the health benefits provided for its employees and maintained reserves in this regard and relied upon a recognized actuarial consulting firm to help it set and maintain these reserves 
after the spin off  the company s liability is limited to  per case and an aggregate of  annually 
the company was obligated as a guarantor with respect to the debt of mestek  inc under mestek s primary commercial bank line of credit 
as of the effective date of the spin off as disclosed in note  the guaranty was cancelled and is no longer in effect 
the company has disclosed the estimated contingency related to the settlement agreement reached on february  in the commitments caption above 
warranty commitments gas transmission products such as those made by the company carry potentially serious personal injury risks in the event of failures in the field 
as a result  the company has extensive internal testing and other quality control procedures and historically the company has not had a meaningful failure rate in the field due to the extensive nature of these quality controls 
due to the company s quality systems  the warranty expense is de minimis  and accordingly  the company does not maintain a warranty reserve beyond a nominal amount 
future impact of known trends or uncertainties the company s operations are sensitive to a number of market factors  any one of which could materially adversely affect its results of operations in any given year construction activity the company is directly impacted by the level of single family and multi family residential housing starts and  to a lesser extent  commercial construction starts 
historically low interest rates had contributed to strong residential construction activity in recent years 
significant increases in interest rates or reductions in residential construction activity for other reasons in future periods  however  could be expected to adversely affect the company s revenues  possibly materially 
technological changes although the hvac industry has historically been impacted by technology changes in a relatively incremental manner  it cannot be discounted that radical changes such as might be suggested by fuel cell technology  burner technology and or other developing technologies which might impact the use of natural gas could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations and or financial position in the future 
weather conditions the company s flagship tracpipe product is used in residential and commercial heating applications 
as such  the demand for its products is impacted by weather as it affects the level of construction 
furthermore  severe climatic changes  such as those suggested by the global warming phenomenon  could over time adversely affect the demand for heating products and adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial position 
purchasing practices it has been the company s policy in recent years to aggregate purchase volumes for high value commodities with fewer vendors to achieve maximum cost reductions while maintaining quality and service 
this policy has been effective in reducing costs but has introduced additional risk which could potentially result in short term supply disruptions or cost increases from time to time in the future 
supply disruptions and commodity risks the company uses a variety of materials in the manufacture of its products  including stainless steel  polyethylene and brass for its autoflare connectors 
in connection with the purchase of commodities  principally stainless steel for manufacturing requirements  the company typically enters into one year purchase commitments which include a designated fixed price range 
these agreements require the company to accept delivery of the commodity in the quantities committed  at the agreed upon prices 
transactions required for these commodities in excess of the one year commitments are conducted at current market prices at the company s discretion 
in addition to the raw material cost strategy described above  the company enters into fixed pricing agreements for the fabrication charges necessary to convert these commodities into useable product 
management believes at present that it has adequate sources of supply for its raw materials and components subject to the risks described above under purchasing practices and has historically not had significant difficulty in obtaining the raw materials  component parts or finished goods from its suppliers 
the company is not dependent for any commodity on a single supplier  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on its business 
interest rate sensitivity the company currently has no borrowing with any lending institutions and therefore has very little risk related to interest rate volatility 
interest rates are nonetheless significant to the company as a participant in the residential construction industry 
see construction activity  above 
retention of qualified personnel the company does not operate with multiple levels of management 
it is relatively flat organizationally  which does subject the company to the risks associated with the loss of critical managers for whatever reason 
from time to time  there may be a shortage of skilled labor  which may make it more difficult and expensive for the company to attract and retain qualified employees 
the company is dependent upon the relatively unique talents and managerial skills of a small number of key executives 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates financial reporting release no 
 released by the securities and exchange commission  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements include a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the company s more significant accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition  accounts receivable valuations  inventory valuations  goodwill and intangible asset valuations  product liability costs  workers compensation claims reserves  health care claims reserves  and accounting for income taxes 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies and significant estimates and assumptions are described in more detail as follows revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition activities relate almost entirely to the manufacture and sale of its flexible metal hose and related products 
under generally accepted accounting principles  revenues are considered to have been earned when the company has substantially accomplished what it must do to be entitled to the benefits represented by the revenues 
with respect to sales of the company s products  the following criteria represent preconditions to the recognition of revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and historical write off experience 
while management believes the allowance to be adequate  if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory the company values its inventory at the lower of cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory  determined on the first in  first out fifo method  or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
the company periodically reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and or obsolete inventory based primarily on its historical usage  as well as estimated forecast of product demand 
a significant decrease in demand for the company s products or technological changes in the industries in which the company operates could result in an increase of excess or obsolete inventory quantities on hand  requiring adjustments to the value of the company s inventories 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with fas  the company ceased recording amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives effective january  the company performed annual valuation exercises in accordance with fas as of december  and december  which analyses indicated in all cases no impairment of goodwill 
product liability reserves as explained more fully under contingencies  the company retains liability for the first  of product liability claims 
to date  the company has not experienced a meaningful product failure rate 
workers compensation claims reserves prior to the spin off  the company provided workers compensation coverage principally through commercial insurance carriers using high deductible programs  which required the company to reserve for and pay a high proportion of its workers compensation claims payable and relied upon the expertise of its insurance carriers and its own historical experience in setting the reserves related to these claims 
two such workers compensation claims are still outstanding from the pre spin off period for which the company remains liable for amounts up to the deductible 
the company maintains a reserve for these amounts 
in all two cases the remaining potential liability is minimal  as these cases are reaching the maximum deductible 
after the spin off  the company is insured on a first dollar basis 
health care claim reserves prior to the spin off  the company self insured a substantial portion of the health benefits provided for its employees and maintained reserves in this regard and relied upon a recognized actuarial consulting firm to help it set and maintain these reserves 
after the spin off  the company s liability is limited to  per case and an aggregate of  annually 
accounting for income taxes up to the date of the spin off  the company elected to file its federal income tax return as part of the mestek  inc parent company  consolidated return 
mestek and omega accounted for omega s federal tax liabilities on the separate company basis method in accordance with fas  accounting for income taxes 
under this method omega recorded tax expense and related deferred taxes and tax benefits in a manner comparable to that which it would record if it were not affiliated with mestek 
the company filed a separate federal income tax return for the five months of in which it was a separate and public company and expects to file a separate federal income tax return for in its entirety 
by agreement  the company will be responsible for and hold mestek harmless from  any liability for its income taxes for all taxable periods  whether before or after the spin off 
the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires it to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates  including those outside the united states which may be subject to certain risks that ordinarily would not be expected in the united states 
the income tax accounting process involves estimating its actual current exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as depreciation  stock based compensation  and legal settlements for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company must then record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized
