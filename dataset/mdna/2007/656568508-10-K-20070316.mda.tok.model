executive overview our business and strategy we are a global supplier of networking solutions serving both service provider and enterprise customers 
our networking solutions include hardware and software products and services designed to reduce complexity  improve efficiency  increase productivity  and drive customer value 
our technologies span access and core networks  support multimedia and business critical applications  and help eliminate today s barriers to efficiency  speed and performance by simplifying networks and connecting people with information 
our business activities include the design  development  engineering  marketing  sale  supply  licensing  installation  servicing and support of these networking solutions 
the telecommunications industry has evolved over the past two decades by developing new technologies and using those technologies to build smarter and faster networks 
we believe that the telecommunications industry today stands at the threshold of a new era to be fueled by increasing demand for pervasive personal broadband capabilities that provide high bandwidth access to any application from any device and any location 
we believe that innovation in this era will be driven by three emerging trends hyperconnectivity  true broadband  and the emergence of communications enabled applications 
hyperconnectivity refers to the expected dramatic increase in demand for network connections as more devices such as portable gaming and entertainment devices  digital cameras  appliances  motor vehicles  and other devices are added to the network 
true broadband refers to the ability of an internet user to access the network from any location using any access device without losing quality  connectivity  content or clarity 
we believe that the increasing use of video  high definition television  video on demand  peer to peer connectivity  and other applications requiring the use of significant bandwidth will result in increased demand for true broadband 
to deliver a true broadband experience to users  wired and wireless access bandwidth will need to be substantially increased and fixed and mobile communications will need to continue to converge 
communications enabled applications refers to the trend towards web based  network aware applications and services which will be made possible by middleware based on emerging technologies like service oriented architecture and ip multimedia subsystem  or ims 
our strategy is to capitalize on these trends by transforming enterprises to support a hyperconnected world  delivering next generation mobility and convergence to enable a true broadband experience  and providing networking solutions that integrate networks and applications into a seamless framework 
our short term focus has been on i the transformation of our businesses and processes  ii integrity renewal and iii growth imperatives 
we believe we are well positioned to deliver wireless and wireline infrastructure  applications and services to carrier and enterprise customers 
our plan for business transformation is expected to address our most significant operational challenges and is focused on simplifying our organizational structure and maintaining a strong focus on revenue generation and improved operating margins as well as quality improvements and cost reductions through a program known as six sigma 
this plan contemplates the transformation of our business in six key areas services  procurement effectiveness  revenue stimulation including sales and pricing  research and development  or r d  effectiveness  general and administrative effectiveness  and organizational and workforce effectiveness 
employees throughout our organization are engaged in supporting various objectives in each of these areas 
other initiatives include the continued progress of our finance transformation project  which will implement  among other things  a new information technology platform to provide an integrated global financial system 
we remain focused on integrity renewal through a commitment to effective corporate governance practices  remediation of material weaknesses in our internal controls and ethical conduct 
we have an enhanced compliance function that places greater emphasis on compliance with applicable laws and company policies  and we have increased employee awareness of ethics issues through an online ethics training program and a new code of business conduct 
our long term growth imperatives are motivated by a desire to generate profitable growth and focus on areas where we can attain a leadership position and a minimum market share of twenty percent in key technologies  with a specific focus on mobility and convergence  enterprise transformation  and services and solutions 
we anticipate that industry demand for wireless networking solutions will be increased due to continued subscriber and network traffic growth to support applications such as mobile video 
we anticipate growth opportunities in this area and plan to increase our investment in metro ethernet  particularly to support video delivery over wired as well as wireless access  and in products compliant with the worldwide interoperability for microwave access  or wimax  standard  and the ims service creation and control architecture 
we believe we are well positioned in many enterprise voice networks today  but continue to face competitive challenges in integrating our voice and data portfolios to capitalize on the trend towards internet protocol  or ip  converged networks 
we have taken steps to strengthen our end to end convergence solutions and focus on the enterprise market  including through the acquisition of tasman networks inc  which has strengthened our data portfolio 
in the third quarter of we entered into a strategic alliance with microsoft corporation to facilitate the ongoing transition of a key component of our business from traditional voice technology to software 
commencing in the third quarter of  in an effort to align our resources and reporting to our strategy  we changed our organization and began reporting our operating results in four segments mobility and converged core networks  or mccn  enterprise solutions  or es  metro ethernet networks  or men  and global services  or gs 
the mccn segment provides wireless networking solutions that enable service providers and cable operators to supply mobile voice  data and multimedia communications services to individuals and enterprises using mobile telephones  personal digital assistants  and other wireless computing and communications devices 
the es segment provides communication solutions for our enterprise customers that are used to build new networks and to transform existing communications networks into more cost effective  packet based networks supporting data  voice and multimedia communications 
the men segment provides optical networking and carrier grade ethernet data networking solutions to make our carrier and large enterprise customers networks more scalable and reliable for the high speed delivery of diverse multi media communications services 
the gs segment provides a broad range of services to address the requirements of our carrier and enterprise customers throughout the entire lifecycle of their networks 
we have recast our fiscal and results to reflect these changes in our reportable segments 
in the first half of  we expect to further refine our segments by including installation  engineering  and project management services in our gs segment 
these services are currently bundled with our product revenue and are included in each of es  men  and mccn 
how we measure business performance our president and chief executive officer has been identified as our chief operating decision maker in assessing the performance and allocating resources to our operating segments 
the primary financial measure used by the ceo is management earnings loss before income taxes  or management ebt 
this measure includes the cost of revenues  selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expense  r d expense  interest expense  other income expense net  minority interests net of tax and equity in net earnings loss of associated companies net of tax 
interest attributable to long term debt is not allocated to a reportable segment and is included in other 
commencing in  the ceo will use both management ebt and operating margin as the primary financial measures in assessing performance and allocating resources 
operating margin is defined as gross profit  less sg a and r d expenses divided by revenue 
financial highlights the following is a summary of our financial highlights change change revenues gross margin pts operating expenses a management ebt b net earnings loss cash and cash equivalents a operating expenses includes sg a  r d  and special charges 
b see note  segment information to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of management ebt to net earnings loss from continuing operations 
as discussed below under restatements  remedial measures and the elimination of material weaknesses  related matters  we have restated our consolidated financial statements for    and the first  second  and third quarters of and for additional information please see note  restatement of previously issued financial statements to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
revenues increased to  revenues increased across all of our business segments and from a geographic perspective the increase was driven by the europe  middle east and africa  or emea  and asia regions 
the majority of our revenue growth is attributable to the addition of a full year of results from nortel government solutions  or ngs  and the lg nortel joint venture  or lg nortel  and favorable foreign exchange impacts 
gross margin decreased percentage points to the impact of increased competition  our revenue growth in lower margin markets in asia from lg nortel and in europe  and the shift in product mix from mature technologies with higher margins to next generation technologies with lower margins resulted in gross margin declines in as compared to the impacts of these trends were most significant in the es and men segments 
operating expenses increased by and were at of revenue while spending increased modestly in compared to  our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue have trended downwards over the last two years 
management ebt decreased to a loss of the decrease in management ebt was driven primarily by decreases in the es segment and increases in corporate costs related to increased interest expenses 
the mccn and gs segments continued to be significantly more profitable than es and men 
net earnings loss increased to net earnings of from a net loss of  the increase in net earnings was driven primarily by changes in the fair value of our shareholder class action lawsuit settlement and a gain related to the divestiture of certain assets and liabilities related to our umts access business 
the net loss in included a charge of  related to the global class action settlement 
cash and cash equivalents increased to  the increase in cash was primarily driven by net cash from operating activities of  net cash from financing activities of  and net positive impacts from foreign exchange of  partially offset by net cash used in investing activities of significant business developments in and divestiture of umts access assets on december   we completed the sale of substantially all our assets and liabilities  related to our umts access products and services to alcatel lucent 
the sale  structured as an asset and share transaction  resulted in gross proceeds of  adjusted primarily for warranty liabilities  for net proceeds of all of which were received in the fourth quarter of in addition  we provided alcatel lucent with a promissory note in lieu of transferring working capital  which was paid in the first quarter of as a result of the sale  we transferred in net assets comprised primarily of fixed assets and inventory  substantially all existing umts access contracts  intellectual property  and approximately  employees attributed to our umts access products 
additionally  we wrote off net assets of related primarily to unbilled receivables  goodwill  prepaid assets and deferred revenue and costs  and recorded additional liabilities of  relating to transaction costs 
we have retained our existing umts access customer contracts related to lg nortel and will source the umts access products and services from alcatel lucent 
we and alcatel lucent have also agreed to provide certain transitional services to each other in order to facilitate the various aspects of the divesture 
we have committed to provide r d  manufacturing and real estate transition services in addition to providing alcatel lucent the right to use all proprietary intellectual property used in our umts access products and services which are also common to other nortel products and services 
in addition  alcatel lucent has options to extend its license rights to other nortel long term evolution related and gsm technology for consideration of and  respectively 
these options expire december  and december   respectively 
we have recorded a net gain of and deferred income of primarily due to contingent liabilities related to a loss sharing arrangement based on operating results 
in  the access portion of our umts business generated estimated revenues and incurred estimated r d costs of approximately and  respectively 
the expected r d costs savings from this divestiture will be partially offset by additional r d investments in technologies where we believe we can attain a leadership position 
in  we will continue to generate revenue from our umts access contracts in lg nortel 
however  as a result of the divestiture  our total revenue from umts access will be significantly lower than in credit facility and senior notes on february   our indirect subsidiary  nortel networks inc  or nni  entered into a new one year credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of  or the credit facility 
the credit facility was drawn down in the full amount on february   and we used the net proceeds primarily to repay at maturity the outstanding  aggregate principal amount of the notes due february  issued by our principal operating subsidiary  nortel networks limited  or nnl

these initiatives include a work plan which is expected to result in a reduction of approximately  positions globally and the creation of approximately new positions in operations centers of excellence  or the restructuring plan 
we also announced significant changes to our north american employee benefit plans 
as a result of the employee benefit plan changes  we recorded a gain of in the third quarter of this benefit was realized evenly across gross profit  sg a expense  and r d expense 
on february   we outlined the next steps of our business transformation plan with the announcement of a work plan to implement a net reduction in our global workforce of approximately  positions  or the restructuring plan 
we expect that approximately of these reductions will take place in as part of this plan we will also shift approximately  positions from higher cost to lower cost locations  with approximately of this activity taking place in the restructuring plan also includes initiatives to more efficiently manage our various business locations and reduce our global real estate portfolio by approximately  square feet by the end of upon completion  the restructuring plan is expected to result in annual savings of approximately we currently expect to incur charges related to the restructuring plan of approximately  with approximately related to the workforce reductions and approximately related to the real estate actions 
approximately of the aggregate charges are expected to be incurred in  with the remainder expected to be incurred in cash expenditures related to the restructuring plan are currently estimated to be approximately  and are expected to be incurred generally in the same timeframe 
global class action settlement in february  we announced an agreement to settle two significant class action lawsuits pending in the us district court for the southern district of new york  or the global class action settlement 
subsequently we entered into agreements to settle all related canadian actions 
in december of and january of  the global class action settlement was approved by the courts in new york  ontario  quebec  and british columbia 
the global class action settlement remains conditioned on  among other things  receipt of securities regulatory and stock exchange approvals  and finalizing the court approved orders 
under the terms of the global class action settlement  we will pay in cash and issue approximately  common shares of nortel which represents approximately of our common shares outstanding as of february   the date the agreement in principle was reached with the plaintiffs in the us class action lawsuits  reflecting our for share consolidation on december   to the plaintiffs  and will contribute to the plaintiffs one half of any recovery resulting from our ongoing litigation against certain former officers of nortel

of this amount  related to the cash portion  which was placed in escrow on june   along with in accrued interest  and  related to the equity component 
we have adjusted the equity component in each quarter of and will further adjust it in future quarters based on the fair value of the nortel networks corporation common shares issuable until the finalization of the settlement 
as of december   the fair value of the equity component had decreased to  resulting in a recovery of for acquisitions on february   we acquired tasman networks  an established networking company that provides a portfolio of secure enterprise routers  for approximately in cash and related liabilities 
the purchase price allocation of included approximately of goodwill acquired  of intangible assets acquired and in net liabilities assumed 
we recorded an expense of for in process research and development in the second quarter of the allocation of the purchase price is based on management s best estimate of the relative values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
supply chain strategy in recent years we have entered into agreements to outsource substantially all of our manufacturing operations  culminating in a agreement with flextronics international ltd 
and flextronics telecom systems ltd  or flextronics  for the divestiture of substantially all of our remaining manufacturing operations and related activities

the transfer of our calgary operations represented the final transfer to flextronics 
the completion of the agreement for the divestiture of substantially all of our remaining manufacturing operations and related activities resulted in the transfer of approximately  employees to flextronics and gross cash proceeds of on october   we signed an amendment to various agreements with flextronics to restructure our purchase commitments and increase our obligation to reimburse flextronics for certain costs associated with the transaction 
these amendments allow for increased flexibility to drive cost reductions through our business transformation initiatives 
we do not expect to recognize a material net gain as a result of this divestiture

restatements  remedial measures and the elimination of material weaknesses  related matters previous restatements we have effected successive restatements of prior period financial results 
in december  we restated our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and  and for the quarters ended march  and june   or the first restatement 
following an independent review of the facts and circumstances leading to the first restatement  or the independent review  we restated our financial statements for the years ended december  and  and the quarters ended march  and  june  and  and september  and  or the second restatement 
over the course of the second restatement process  we identified a number of reportable conditions  each constituting a material weakness  in our internal control over financial reporting as of december  as of december   and as recently as september   we reported the following five material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting lack of compliance with written nortel procedures for monitoring and adjusting balances related to certain accruals and provisions  including restructuring charges and contract and customer accruals  lack of compliance with nortel procedures for appropriately applying applicable gaap to the initial recording of certain liabilities including those described in statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for contingencies  or sfas no 
 and to foreign currency translation as described in sfas no 
 foreign currency translation  or sfas no 
 lack of sufficient personnel with appropriate knowledge  experience and training in us gaap and lack of sufficient analysis and documentation of the application of us gaap to transactions  including but not limited to revenue transactions  lack of a clear organization and accountability structure within the accounting function  including insufficient review and supervision  combined with financial reporting systems that are not integrated and which require extensive manual interventions  and lack of sufficient awareness of  and timely and appropriate remediation of  internal control issues by nortel personnel 
for additional information relating to the control deficiencies that resulted in these material weaknesses  please see the controls and procedures section of our  and annual reports on form k 
at the recommendation of the audit committee  in january the board of directors adopted all of the recommendations for remedial measures of the independent review summarized in the summary of findings and of recommended remedial measures of the independent review  submitted to the audit committee in january by wilmer cutler pickering hale dorr llp and huron consulting services llc  or the independent review summary 
those governing remedial principles were designed to prevent recurrence of the inappropriate accounting conduct found in the independent review  to rebuild a finance environment based on transparency and integrity  and to ensure sound financial reporting and comprehensive disclosure 
the governing remedial principles included establishing standards of conduct to be enforced through appropriate discipline  infusing strong technical skills and experience into the finance organization  requiring comprehensive  ongoing training on increasingly complex accounting standards  strengthening and improving internal controls and processes  establishing a compliance program throughout the company that is appropriately staffed and funded  requiring management to provide clear and concise information  in a timely manner  to the board of directors to facilitate its decision making  and implementing an information technology platform that improves the reliability of financial reporting and reduces the opportunities for manipulation of results 
please see the independent review summary in the controls and procedures section of our annual report on form k for further information concerning these governing principles as they relate to three identified categories people  processes and technology 
as part of the remedial measures and to compensate for the unremedied material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  we undertook intensive efforts in to enhance our controls and procedures relating to the recognition of revenue 
these efforts included  among other measures  extensive documentation and review of customer contracts for revenue recognized in and earlier periods 
as a result of the contract review  it became apparent that certain of the contracts had not been accounted for properly under us gaap 
management s determination that these errors required correction led to the audit committee s decision on march  to effect a further restatement of our consolidated financial statements  or the third restatement  which was effected with the filing of our k a and nnl s annual report on form k for the year ended december   or nnl s k  with the sec and canadian securities regulators on may  during  we continued to build on the remedial actions in and and implemented significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting and continued to develop and implement remedial measures to address the material weaknesses that existed as of december  and each of the quarters within  as well as to implement the recommendations for remedial measures in the independent review summary 
we believe that the remedial measures and other actions to significantly improve internal control over financial reporting  described in the controls and procedures section of this report  individually and in the aggregate addressed most of the internal control issues in the five material weaknesses 
as at december   we concluded that these measures resulted in the elimination of the five material weaknesses  with the exception of the deficiencies that comprise the following revenue related material weakness as at december   which is further described in the controls and procedures section of this report lack of sufficient cross functional communication and coordination  including further definition of roles and responsibilities  with respect to the scope and timing of customer arrangements  insufficient segregation of duties in certain areas  delayed implementation of nortel review processes and personnel for the lg nortel joint venture  and insufficient controls over certain end user computing applications  all of which impact upon the appropriate application of us gaap to revenue generating transactions 
current restatement of previously issued financial statements in the course of the preparation of our financial statements  we identified certain errors primarily through discussions with our north american pension and post retirement actuaries and through our ongoing remediation efforts with respect to our material weakness related to revenue recognition and our previously reported material weaknesses and other internal control deficiencies 
as a result  we have restated our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and consolidated statement of operations  changes in equity and comprehensive income loss and statement of cash flows for the years ended december  and the adjustments relate to i pension and post retirement benefits errors  ii revenue recognition errors  iii a prior year tax error  and iv other errors

the indenture governing the notes and related guarantees contain various covenants that limit our ability to incur liens other than certain permitted liens on assets of nnc and its restricted subsidiaries to secure funded debt in excess of certain permitted amounts without equally and ratably securing the notes to merge  consolidate  sell or otherwise dispose of substantially all of the assets of any of nnc  nnl and  so long as nni is a guarantor of the notes  nni  unless the surviving entity or purchaser of such assets assumes the obligations of nnc  nnl or nni  as the case may be  under the notes and related guarantees and no default exists under the indenture governing the notes after giving effect to such merger  consolidation or sale 
in addition  the indenture governing the notes and related guarantees contain covenants that  at any time that the notes do not have an investment grade rating  limit our ability to incur  assume  issue or guarantee additional funded debt including capital leases and certain types of preferred stock  or repurchase  redeem  retire or pay any dividends in respect of any nortel networks corporation stock or nnl preferred stock  in excess of certain permitted amounts or incur debt that is subordinated to any other debt of nnc  nnl or nni  unless that new debt is expressly subordinated to the notes and the guarantees 
at any time that the notes do not have an investment grade rating  our ability to incur  assume  issue or guarantee additional indebtedness and certain types of preferred stock and pay dividends is tied to an adjusted ebitda to fixed charges ratio 
adjusted ebitda is generally defined in the indenture governing the notes as consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  adjusted for certain restructuring charges and other one time charges and gains that will be excluded from the calculation of adjusted ebitda 
fixed charges is defined in the indenture governing the notes as consolidated interest expense plus dividends paid on certain preferred stock 
our december  adjusted ebitda to fixed charges ratio does not permit us to incur debt under the covenant 
however  pursuant to certain significant exceptions and carve outs contained in the covenants in the indenture governing the notes  we may incur certain debt and make certain restricted payments without regard to the adjusted ebitda to fixed charges ratio up to certain permitted amounts 
we believe that these exceptions and carve outs currently provide us with sufficient flexibility to incur additional indebtedness  if we chose to do so  in order to operate our business 
upon a change of control  nnl is required within days to make an offer to purchase the notes then outstanding at a purchase price equal to plus accrued and unpaid interest 
change of control is defined in the indenture governing the notes as  among other things  the filing of a schedule d or schedule to under the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the exchange act  by any person or group unaffiliated with nortel disclosing that such person or group has become the beneficial owner of a majority of the voting stock of nortel networks corporation or has the power to elect a majority of the members of the board of directors of nortel or our ceasing to be the beneficial owner of of the voting power of the common stock of nnl 
future uses and sources of liquidity the forward looking statements below are subject to important risks  uncertainties and assumptions  which are difficult to predict and the actual outcome may be materially different from that anticipated 
see the risk factors section of this report 
we believe the following are the key uncertainties exist regarding our liquidity we expect our ability to increase revenue and generate positive cash from operating activities to be a primary uncertainty regarding our liquidity 
in prior years  our operating results have produced negative cash flow from operations due in large part to our inability to reduce operating expenses as a percentage of revenue and the continued negative impact on gross margin due to competitive pressures  product mix and other factors discussed in this report 
if capital spending by our customers changes or pricing and margins change from what we currently expect  our revenues and cash flows may be materially lower and we may be required to further reduce our investments or take other measures in order to meet our cash requirements  we are under continuing regulatory and criminal investigations and subject to litigation proceedings and  as a result  any fines or other penalties or judgments or settlements in connection with our pending civil litigation not encompassed by the global class action settlement  or regulatory or criminal investigations related to the restatements  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity  other than anticipated professional fees and expenses  and our ability and willingness to access the capital markets is based on many factors including market conditions and our overall financial objectives 
currently  our ability is limited by the covenant restriction in our indentures and by our and nnl s credit ratings and which have  in part  contributed to our increased interest and borrowing costs 
we cannot provide any assurance that our net cash requirements will be as we currently expect  that we will be able to refinance any maturing debt as it comes due or that financings will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
future uses of liquidity our cash requirements for the months commencing january   are primarily expected to consist of funding for operations  including our investments in r d  and the following items costs related to our regulatory and other legal proceedings  including  plus accrued interest  in cash related to the global class action settlement 
this payment will be made from our restricted cash and will not impact our cash and cash equivalents balance of  as of december  the cash amount bears interest at a prescribed rate  was placed in escrow on june  and has been classified as restricted cash and cash equivalents 
as part of the global class action settlement  we agreed with our insurers to certain indemnification obligations 
we believe that these indemnification obligations are unlikely to materially increase our total cash payment obligations under the global class action settlement  cash contributions for pension  post retirement and post employment funding of approximately  capital expenditures of approximately  costs related to workforce reductions and real estate actions in connection with the restructuring plan of approximately  costs related to workforce reduction and other restructuring activities for all other restructuring plans of approximately  costs associated with the completion of the divestiture of our manufacturing operations to flextronics and the divestiture of certain assets and liabilities related to our umts access business to alcatel lucent of approximately and  respectively  and costs related to our finance transformation project which will include  among other things  implementing sap to provide an integrated global financial system  of approximately also  from time to time  we may purchase or redeem our outstanding debt securities and or convertible notes and may enter into acquisition or joint ventures as opportunities arise

c amounts represent interest obligations on our long term debt excluding capital leases as at december  as described in note  financial instruments and hedging activities  to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements  we have entered into certain interest rate swap contracts which swap fixed rate payments for floating rate payments 
for the purposes of estimating our future payment obligations with regards to floating rate payments  we have used the floating rate in effect as at december  d for additional information  see note  commitments  to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
e represents our estimate of our pension  post retirement and post employment obligations only 
we will continue to have funding obligations in each future period  however we are not currently able to estimate those amounts 
during  we fulfilled a purchase commitment which existed at december  on february   nni entered into the credit facility which was drawn down in full to repay at maturity the outstanding  aggregate principal amount of nnl s notes on february  on july   nnl completed the notes offering and repaid the credit facility 
purchase obligations purchase obligation amounts in the above table represent the minimum obligation under our supply arrangements related to products and or services entered into in the normal course of our business 
where the arrangement specifies quantity  pricing and timing information  we have included that arrangement in the amounts presented above 
in certain cases  these arrangements define an end date of the contract  but do not specify timing of payments between december  and the end date of the agreement 
in those cases  we have estimated the timing of the payments based on forecasted usage rates 
as part of our agreement with flextronics regarding the divestiture of substantially all of our remaining manufacturing operations  flextronics has the ability in certain cases to exercise rights to sell back to us certain inventory and equipment after the expiration of a specified period of up to fifteen months following the respective closing date of each facility transfer 
we do not expect such rights to be exercised with respect to any material amount of inventory and or equipment 
outsourcing contracts outsourcing contract amounts in the table above represent our minimum contractual obligation for services provided to us for a portion of our information services function 
the amount payable under our outsourcing contracts is variable to the extent that our hardware volumes and workforce fluctuates from the baseline levels contained in the contracts and our contractual obligation could increase above such baseline amount 
if our hardware volumes or workforce were to fall below the baseline levels in the contracts  we would be required to make the minimum payments included above 
obligations under special charges obligations under special charges in the above table reflect undiscounted amounts related to contract settlement and lease costs and are expected to be substantially drawn down by the end of balance sheet provisions of for workforce reduction costs  included in restructuring in current liabilities in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements  have not been reflected in the contractual cash obligations table above 
pension and post retirement obligations during  we made cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans of and to our post retirement benefit plans of in  we expect to make cash contributions of approximately to our defined benefit pension plans and approximately to our post retirement benefit plans 
other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet relate to asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation accruals 
payment information related to our asset retirement obligations has been presented based on the termination date after the first renewal period of the associated lease contracts 
payment information related to our deferred compensation accruals has been presented based on the anticipated retirement dates of the employees participating in the programs 
future sources of liquidity in recent years  our operating results have not produced significant cash flow from operations due in large part to our inability to reduce operating expenses as a percentage of revenue and the continued negative impact on gross margin due to competitive pressures  product mix and other factors discussed above under results of operations continuing operations 
in addition  we have made significant cash payments related to our restructuring programs and pension plans 
our ability to generate sustainable cash from operations will depend on our ability to generate profitable revenue streams  reduce our operating expenses and continue to improve our working capital management 
as of december   our primary source of liquidity was cash 
we believe our cash will be sufficient to fund the changes to our business model in accordance with our strategic plan see executive overview our business and strategy  fund our investments and meet our customer commitments for at least the month period commencing january   including the cash expenditures outlined under future uses of liquidity above 
available support facility on february   nnl entered into the edc support facility 
as of december   the facility provided for up to in support including of committed revolving support for performance bonds or similar instruments with individual amounts of up to  of which was outstanding  and of uncommitted support for performance bonds or similar instruments and or receivables sales and or securitizations  of which was outstanding 
the edc support facility does not materially restrict nnl s ability to sell any of its assets subject to certain maximum amounts or to purchase or pre pay any of its currently outstanding debt 
the edc support facility provides that edc may suspend its obligation to issue nnl any additional support if events occur that would have a material adverse effect on nnl s business  financial position or results of operation 
in addition  the edc support facility can be suspended or terminated if nnl s senior long term debt rating by moody s investors service  or moody s  has been downgraded to less than b or if its debt rating by standard poor s  or s p  has been downgraded to less than b 
edc has also agreed to provide future support under the edc support facility on an unsecured basis and without the guarantees of nnl s subsidiaries provided that should nnl or its subsidiaries incur liens on its assets securing certain indebtedness  or should any subsidiary of nnl incur or guarantee certain indebtedness in the future above agreed thresholds of in north america and outside of north america  equal and ratable security and or guarantees of nnl s obligations under the edc support facility would be required at that time 
during the first half of  nnl s obligations under the edc support facility were equally and ratably secured with the credit facility and our notes due september by a pledge of substantially all of our and nnl s us and canadian personal property and the us personal property of nni 
nnl s obligations under the edc support facility also were guaranteed by nnc and nni at such time 
these guarantees and security agreements were terminated on july  with the repayment of the credit facility 
in connection with the  notes offering discussed above  nnl  nni and edc entered into a new guarantee agreement dated july  by which nni agreed to guarantee nnl s obligations under the edc support facility during such time that the  notes are guaranteed by nni 
effective december   nnl and edc amended and restated the edc support facility to maintain the total edc support facility at up to  including the existing of committed support for performance bonds and similar instruments  with individual amounts up to  and to extend the maturity date of the edc support facility for an additional year to december  as a result of the breach of certain provisions of nnl s edc support facility related to the required restatement by nnl of certain of its prior period results  absent a waiver  edc will have the right to refuse to issue additional support and to terminate its commitments under the support facility  subject to a day cure period with respect to certain provisions 
on march   nnl obtained a waiver from edc 
shelf registration statement and base shelf prospectus in  we and nnl filed a shelf registration statement with the sec and a base shelf prospectus with the applicable securities regulatory authorities in canada  to qualify the potential sale of up to  of various types of securities in the us and or canada 
the qualifying securities include common shares  preferred shares  debt securities  warrants to purchase equity or debt securities  share purchase contracts and share purchase or equity units subject to certain approvals 
as of december   approximately  under the shelf registration statement and base shelf prospectus had been utilized 
as of june   the canadian base shelf prospectus expired 
as a result of the delayed filing of our form k a  nnl s form k and the first quarter reports with the sec due to the third restatement  we and nnl continue to be unable to use  in its current form as a short form shelf registration statement  the remaining approximately of capacity for various types of securities under our sec shelf registration statement

there can be no assurance that our credit ratings will not be lowered or that these ratings agencies will not issue adverse commentaries about us or nnl  potentially resulting in higher financing costs and reduced access to capital markets or alternative financing arrangements 
a reduction in our credit ratings may also affect our ability  and the cost  to securitize receivables  obtain bid  performance related and other bonds  access the edc support facility and or enter into normal course derivative or hedging transactions 
off balance sheet arrangements bid  performance related and other bonds we have entered into bid  performance related and other bonds in connection with various contracts 
bid bonds generally have a term of less than twelve months  depending on the length of the bid period for the applicable contract 
performance related and other bonds generally have a term of twelve months and are typically renewed  as required  over the term of the applicable contract 
the various contracts to which these bonds apply generally have terms ranging from two to five years 
any potential payments which might become due under these bonds would be related to our non performance under the applicable contract 
historically  we have not had to make material payments and we do not anticipate that we will be required to make material payments under these types of bonds 
the following table provides information related to these types of bonds as of december  december  bid and performance related bonds a other bonds b total bid  performance related and other bonds a net of restricted cash and cash equivalents amounts of and as of december  and  respectively 
b net of restricted cash and cash equivalents amounts of and as of december  and  respectively 
the edc support facility is used to support bid and performance bonds with varying terms  including those with at least day terms 
any bid or performance related bonds with terms that extend beyond december  are currently not eligible for the support provided by this facility 
if the facility is not further extended beyond december   we would likely need to increase our use of cash collateral to support these obligations beginning on january   absent a further extension of the facility 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting policies generally accepted in the us  which require us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent our critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition  provisions for doubtful accounts  provisions for inventory  provisions for product warranties  income taxes  goodwill valuation  pension and post retirement benefits  special charges and other contingencies 
in general  any changes in estimates or assumptions relating to revenue recognition  provisions for doubtful accounts  provisions for inventory and other contingencies excluding legal contingencies are directly reflected in the results of our reportable operating segments 
changes in estimates or assumptions pertaining to our tax asset valuations  our pension and post retirement benefits and our legal contingencies are generally not reflected in our reportable operating segments  but are reflected on a consolidated basis 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition our material revenue streams are the result of a wide range of activities  from custom design and installation over a period of time to a single delivery of equipment to a customer 
our networking solutions also cover a broad range of technologies and are offered on a global basis 
as a result  our revenue recognition policies can differ depending on the level of customization within the solution and the contractual terms with the customer 
newer technologies within one of our reporting segments may also have different revenue recognition policies  depending on  among other factors  the specific performance and acceptance criteria within the applicable contract 
therefore  management must use significant judgment in determining how to apply the current accounting standards and interpretations  not only based on the networking solution  but also within networking solutions based on reviewing the level of customization and contractual terms with the customer 
as a result  our revenues may fluctuate from period to period based on the mix of solutions sold and the geographic region in which they are sold 
when a customer arrangement involves multiple deliverables where the deliverables are governed by more than one authoritative standard  we evaluate all deliverables to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting based on the following criteria whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and if the contract includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and is substantially in our control 
our determination of whether deliverables within a multiple element arrangement can be treated separately for revenue recognition purposes involves significant estimates and judgment  such as whether fair value can be established on undelivered obligations and or whether delivered elements have stand alone value to the customer 
changes to our assessment of the accounting units in an arrangement and or our ability to establish fair values could significantly change the timing of revenue recognition 
if objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for all units of accounting in the contract  revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting or element based on relative fair values 
in situations where there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all undelivered elements  but not for delivered elements  the residual method is used to allocate the contract consideration 
under the residual method  the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements 
each unit of accounting is then accounted for under the applicable revenue recognition guidance 
if sufficient evidence of fair value cannot be established for an undelivered element  revenue related to delivered elements is deferred until the earlier of when sufficient fair value is established or all remaining elements have been delivered 
once there is only one remaining element to be delivered within the unit of accounting  the deferred revenue is recognized based on the revenue recognition guidance applicable to the last delivered element 
for instance  where post contract support is the last delivered element within the unit of accounting  the deferred revenue is recognized ratably over the remaining post contract support term once post contract support is the only undelivered element 
our assessment of which revenue recognition guidance is appropriate to account for a deliverable also can involve significant judgment 
for instance  the determination of whether software is more than incidental to hardware can impact whether the hardware is accounted for under software revenue recognition under aicpa statement of position  or sop  software revenue recognition  or sop  or based on general revenue recognition guidance 
this assessment could significantly impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition 
for elements related to customized network solutions and certain network build outs  revenues are recognized under sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  or sop  generally using the percentage of completion method 
in using the percentage of completion method  revenues are generally recorded based on a measure of the percentage of costs incurred to date on a contract relative to the estimated total expected contract costs 
profit estimates on long term contracts are revised periodically based on changes in circumstances and any losses on contracts are recognized in the period that such losses become known 
generally  the terms of long term contracts provide for progress billing based on completion of certain phases of work 
contract revenues recognized  based on costs incurred towards the completion of the project  that are unbilled are accumulated in the contracts in progress account included in accounts receivable net 
billings in excess of revenues recognized to date on long term contracts are recorded as advance billings in excess of revenues recognized to date on contracts within other accrued liabilities 
significant judgment is often required when estimating total contract costs and progress to completion on these arrangements  as well as whether a loss is expected to be incurred on the contract 
management uses historical experience  project plans and an assessment of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the arrangement to establish these estimates 
uncertainties include implementation delays or performance issues that may or may not be within our control 
changes in these estimates could result in a material impact on revenues and net earnings loss 
revenue for hardware that does not require significant customization  and where any software is considered incidental  is recognized under sec staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition  or sab under sab  revenue is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for hardware  delivery is considered to have occurred upon shipment provided that risk of loss  and title in certain jurisdictions  have been transferred to the customer 
for arrangements where the criteria for revenue recognition have not been met because legal title or risk of loss on products did not transfer to the buyer until final payment had been received or where delivery had not occurred  revenue is deferred to a later period when title or risk of loss passes either on delivery or on receipt of payment from the customer 
for arrangements where the customer agrees to purchase products but we retain possession until the customer requests shipment  or bill and hold arrangements  revenue is not recognized until delivery to the customer has occurred and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
software revenue is generally recognized under sop for software arrangements involving multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative fair value of each element or the residual method  as applicable  and using vendor specific objective evidence of fair values  which is based on prices charged when the element is sold separately 
software revenue accounted for under sop is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software is delivered in accordance with all terms and conditions of the customer contracts  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue related to post contract customer support  or pcs  including technical support and unspecified when and if available software upgrades  is recognized ratably over the pcs term 
under sop or under emerging issues task force  or eitf  abstract  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables or eitf  if fair value does not exist for any undelivered element  revenue is not recognized until the earlier of i the undelivered element is delivered or ii fair value of the undelivered element exists  unless the undelivered element is a service  in which case revenue is recognized as the service is performed once the service is the only undelivered element 
we make certain sales through multiple distribution channels  primarily resellers and distributors 
these customers are generally given certain rights of return 
for products sold through these distribution channels  revenue is recognized from product sale at the time of shipment to the distribution channel when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
accruals for estimated sales returns and other allowances and deferrals are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time of revenue recognition 
these provisions are based on contract terms and prior claims experience and involve significant estimates 
if these estimates are significantly different from actual results  our revenue could be impacted 
we provide extended payment terms on certain software contracts and may sell these receivables to third parties 
the fees on these contracts are considered fixed or determinable if the contracts are similar to others for which we have a standard business practice of providing extended payment terms and have a history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms without making concessions 
if fees are not considered fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement  revenue for delivered products is deferred until the fees become legally due and payable and therefore estimates and judgment in this area can impact the timing of revenue recognition 
the collectibility of trade and notes receivables is also critical in determining whether revenue should be recognized 
as part of the revenue recognition process  we determine whether trade or notes receivables are reasonably assured of collection and whether there has been deterioration in the credit quality of our customers that could result in our inability to collect the receivables 
we will defer revenue but recognize related costs if we are uncertain about whether we will be able to collect the receivable 
as a result  our estimates and judgment regarding customer credit quality could significantly impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
we have a significant deferred revenue balance relative to our consolidated revenue 
recognition of this deferred revenue over time can have a material impact on our consolidated revenue in any period and result in significant fluctuations 
the complexities of our contractual arrangements result in the deferral of revenue for a number of reasons  the most significant of which are discussed below complex arrangements that involve multiple deliverables such as future software deliverables  and or post contractual support which remain undelivered generally result in the deferral of revenue because  in most cases  we have not established fair value for the undelivered elements 
we estimate that these arrangements account for approximately of our deferred revenue balance and will be recognized upon delivery of the final undelivered elements and over time 
in many instances our contractual billing arrangements do not match the timing of the recognition of revenue 
often this occurs in contracts accounted for under sop where we generally recognize the revenue based on a measure of the percentage of costs incurred to date relative to the estimated total expected contract costs 
we estimate that approximately of our deferred revenue balance relates to contractual arrangements where billing milestones preceded revenue recognition 
the following table summarizes our deferred revenue balances as at december  vs 
change change deferred revenue advance billings total deferred revenue deferred revenues decreased by in as a result of reductions related to the net release to revenue of approximately  and other adjustments of including the impact of related to divestitures in  partially offset by an increase due to foreign exchange of the release of deferred revenue to revenue is net of the additional deferrals recorded during provisions for doubtful accounts in establishing the appropriate provisions for trade  notes and long term receivables due from customers  we make assumptions with respect to their future collectibility 
our assumptions are based on an individual assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends 
generally  these individual credit assessments occur prior to the inception of the credit exposure and at regular reviews during the life of the exposure and consider age of the receivables  customer s ability to meet and sustain its financial commitments  customer s current and projected financial condition  collection experience with the customer  historical bad debt experience with the customer  the positive or negative effects of the current and projected industry outlook  and the economy in general 
once we consider all of these individual factors  an appropriate provision is then made  which takes into consideration the likelihood of loss and our ability to establish a reasonable estimate 
in addition to these individual assessments  a regional except asia  excluding lg nortel accounts past due provision is established for outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts based on a review of balances greater than six months past due 
a regional trend analysis  based on past and expected write off activity  is performed on a regular basis to determine the likelihood of loss and establish a reasonable estimate 
the following table summarizes our accounts receivable and long term receivable balances and related reserves of our continuing operations as of december  december  gross accounts receivable provision for doubtful accounts accounts receivable net accounts receivable provision as a percentage of gross accounts receivables gross long term receivables provision for doubtful accounts net long term receivables long term receivable provision as a percentage of gross long term receivables provisions for inventory management must make estimates about the future customer demand for our products when establishing the appropriate provisions for inventory 
when making these estimates  we consider general economic conditions and growth prospects within our customers ultimate marketplace  and the market acceptance of our current and pending products 
these judgments must be made in the context of our customers shifting technology needs and changes in the geographic mix of our customers 
with respect to our provisioning policy  in general  we fully reserve for surplus inventory in excess of our day demand forecast or that we deem to be obsolete 
generally  our inventory provisions have an inverse relationship with the projected demand for our products 
for example  our provisions usually increase as projected demand decreases due to adverse changes in the conditions mentioned above 
we have experienced significant changes in required provisions in recent periods due to changes in strategic direction  such as discontinuances of product lines  as well as declining market conditions 
a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of any of these conditions could result in inventory losses in excess of the provisions determined to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date 
our inventory includes certain direct and incremental deferred costs associated with arrangements where title and risk of loss was transferred to customers but revenue was deferred due to other revenue recognition criteria not being met 
we have not recorded provisions against this type of inventory 
the following table summarizes our inventory balances and other related reserves of our continuing operations as of december  december  gross inventory inventory provisions inventories net a inventory provisions as a percentage of gross inventory inventory provisions as a percentage of gross inventory excluding deferred costs b a includes the long term portion of inventory related to deferred costs  which is included in other assets 
b calculated excluding deferred costs of  and  in and  respectively 
inventory provisions decreased by as a result of of additional inventory provisions and of reclassifications and other adjustments  partially offset by of scrapped inventory and of reductions due to sale of inventory 
in the future  we may be required to make significant adjustments to these provisions for the sale and or disposition of inventory that was provided for in prior periods 
provisions for product warranties provisions are recorded for estimated costs related to warranties given to customers on our products to cover defects 
these provisions are calculated based on historical return rates as well as on estimates  which take into consideration the historical material replacement costs and the associated labor costs to correct the product defect 
known product defects are specifically provided for as we become aware of such defects 
revisions are made when actual experience differs materially from historical experience 
these provisions for product warranties are part of the cost of revenues and are accrued when the product is delivered 
they represent the best possible estimate  at the time the sale is made  of the expenses to be incurred under the warranty granted 
warranty terms generally range from one to six years from the date of sale depending upon the product 
warranty related costs incurred prior to revenue being recognized are capitalized and recognized as an expense when the related revenue is recognized 
we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of revenues based on associated material costs and technical support labor costs 
material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the product 
technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer warranty claims and projected claims within the warranty period 
the following table summarizes the accrual for product warranties that was recorded as part of other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of balance at the beginning of the year payments warranties issued revisions balance at the end of the year we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers 
our estimated warranty obligation is based upon warranty terms  ongoing product failure rates  historical material replacement costs and the associated labor to correct the product defect 
if actual product failure rates  material replacement costs  service or labor costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty provision would be required 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience  or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than the expectations on which the accrual is based  our gross margin could be negatively affected 
income taxes tax asset valuation as of december   our deferred tax asset balance  excluding discontinued operations  was  against which we have recorded a valuation allowance of  resulting in a net deferred tax asset of  as of december   our net deferred tax asset was  the increase in was primarily due to the effects of foreign exchange translation  partially offset by a reduction of deferred tax assets and valuation allowance in profitable jurisdictions 
we currently have deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences  which are available to reduce future income taxes payable in our significant tax jurisdictions namely canada  the us  the us  and france 
during the second quarter of  the canadian government enacted a reduction in the federal tax rate 
the overall rate reduction of approximately will be phased in through  at which time the federal rate will be 
as a result of this change in rates  our gross deferred tax asset was reduced with a corresponding decrease in the amount of valuation allowance established against the gross deferred tax asset 
we assess the realization of these deferred tax assets quarterly to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on available evidence  both positive and negative  we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the main factors that we believe provide evidence about the realizability of our net deferred tax asset are discussed in further detail below and include the following the amount of  and trends related to  cumulative earnings or losses realized over the most recent quarters  our current period net earnings loss and its impact on our strong history of earnings prior to  future earnings projections as determined through the use of internal forecasts  including the impact of sales backlog and existing contracts  our ability to carry forward our tax losses and investment tax credits  including tax planning strategies to accelerate utilization of such assets  industry  business  or other circumstances that may adversely affect future operations  and the nature of the future income required to realize our deferred tax assets 
in evaluating the positive and negative evidence  the weight we assign each type of evidence is proportionate to the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
in the third quarter of  primarily as a result of significant operating losses incurred in and and the impact of those losses on our measure of cumulative losses over the preceding quarters  we recorded a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets in certain of our significant jurisdictions namely canada  the us  and france 
management has concluded that the appropriate length of time for measuring cumulative losses is the most recent three years results  inclusive of the current year 
the establishment of our valuation allowance in the third quarter of coincided with an overall economic shift and significant downturn in the telecommunications industry 
the establishment of a valuation allowance against only a portion of our deferred tax assets in certain of our significant jurisdictions was indicative of our expectation that the telecommunications industry and our results would improve in the near future 
our expectations of improvement were met in  as we returned to profitability during that year 
in the third quarter of  we placed significant weight on the negative evidence related to our cumulative losses 
however  we also placed significant weight on the positive evidence of our strong earnings history  as we had operated at a consistent  cumulative profit prior to since the third quarter of  we have not significantly adjusted the level of our net deferred tax assets in canada  the us  or france other than to present the changes in our deferred tax assets related to other comprehensive income items  foreign currency translation  and the additions of certain refundable tax credits in france 
thus  we have provided valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets related to our losses in these jurisdictions for the applicable periods since establishing the valuation allowance 
at each reporting period since  we have considered the factors listed above to determine if any further adjustments should be made to the net deferred tax asset on a jurisdictional basis 
relative to  the factors we consider have generally trended favorably year over year as our jurisdictional cumulative losses have decreased substantially since as discussed below  we evaluate cumulative earnings loss within each jurisdiction and at nnl 
nnl has operated at near break even since  and the results in canada and the us have improved substantially over the same period relative to and as a result  we have concluded that there have not been sufficient changes to our profitability to warrant additional significant changes to our net deferred tax asset 
we view the and results as anomalies and believe a strong history of earnings prior to in most of our significant jurisdictions namely canada  the us  and the us  in combination with recent trends in and current projections of future profitability provide sufficient positive evidence to overcome the primary piece of negative evidence  cumulative losses over the most recent quarters in certain significant jurisdictions namely canada and the us in the years prior to  our taxable earnings in the significant jurisdictions of canada  the us and the us were in excess of   in us   in canada  and in the us we discuss the earnings history  recent trends in profitability and the cumulative earnings loss position of each jurisdiction in more detail below 
because we believe that the future profitability of our significant jurisdictions will closely track our global trend over time our forecast and future projections of profitability are discussed below rather than in each of the jurisdictional analyses provided later 
see the risk factors section of this report for certain risks that could affect the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
future projections of profitability the ultimate realization of our net deferred tax asset is dependent on the generation of future pre tax income sufficient to realize the underlying tax deductions and credits 
we currently have a significant sales backlog exceeding  for which revenue and margin will be recognized in the future including deferred revenue and advance billings 
we expect the associated margins of this sales backlog to be consistent with our recent historical margins 
in addition to the amounts attributable to the recognition of our deferred revenue and sales backlog  we expect future pre tax income will be realized through increasing revenues and reductions to our existing cost structure 
our expectations about future pre tax income are based on a detailed forecast for including assumptions about market growth rates  segment analysis and cost reduction initiatives 
revenue growth rates inherent in that forecast are based on input from internal and external market intelligence research sources that compare factors such as growth in global economies  regional trends in the telecommunications industry and product evolutions from a technological segment basis 
macro economic factors such as changes in economies  product evolutions  industry consolidation and other changes beyond our control could have a positive or negative impact on achieving our targets 
we are taking actions through our business transformation initiatives  such as exiting products where we cannot achieve market share as well as adjusting our cost base in order to achieve our objective of becoming profitable in the future 
using the detailed forecast as the base  we project our range of future profitability and ability to realize our deferred tax assets assuming both improving revenues based on market growth analysis and no change in revenues and by making certain assumptions about the cost savings we expect to achieve 
the cost savings assumptions are based on management s overall plan to improve profitability including the business transformation initiative designed to improve operating margins by  by the end of recent business transformation initiatives include i the divestiture of the loss making assets and liabilities of our umts access business in the fourth quarter of  ii the restructuring plan and changes to reduce our north american employee benefit plans  and iii the recently announced and planned workforce reductions and the shift of a portion of our employee base to lower cost locations 
these initiatives are discussed in more detail throughout this report 
though we believe our assumptions about future revenues are conservative  our projections assume that revenue will not decrease below forecasted levels 
similarly  we expect to achieve the cost savings reflected in the projection 
however  if our revenue were to decline by greater than of our forecast  and such decline in revenue is not offset by additional cost reductions  or if we are not able to achieve of our projected cost reductions by the end of  the weight we ascribe to our strong earnings history and our ability to achieve forecasted results will decrease and an increase to the valuation allowance will likely be necessary in canada  particularly with respect to short lived investment tax credits  and possibly the us we do not expect an increase or decrease to our valuation allowance in if we are able to meet our forecast 
if we significantly exceed our forecast  we may no longer have quarters of cumulative losses in the us  and perhaps canada  requiring an assessment of whether a portion of the valuation allowance should be released 
in recent years  we have restated earnings multiple times  had significant turnover of senior management  and initiated a complete overhaul of our financial systems and processes 
in the process of restating our financial statements  we have implemented a more appropriate and rigorous revenue recognition process which has required an extensive learning process for financial  legal and operating personnel 
primarily as a result of these events  we have performed at a level less than our previous forecasts and projections 
looking ahead in  we have stabilized a number of these factors and assembled a rigorous forecast based on a thorough understanding of the revenue recognition models with which the company now operates 
the significant majority of our net deferred tax asset is recorded in the us and canada 
as noted above  we are currently in a cumulative loss position in both the us and canada and  as a result  we consider the potential impairment of our net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions to be subject to significant judgment  and changes in certain assumptions regarding the realization of the deferred tax assets could have a material effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
the following table provides the breakdown of our net deferred tax asset  by significant jurisdiction as of december  net other gross tax benefit investment temporary deferred tax valuation net deferred of losses tax credits differences asset allowance tax asset canada a united states a united kingdom france other total a includes of gross deferred tax asset and corresponding valuation allowance in canada at nnc primarily related to a shareholder litigation settlement  and of gross deferred tax asset and corresponding valuation allowance in the us relative to wholly owned us subsidiaries of nnc primarily related to operating losses 
the jurisdictional analysis below provides further information about the positive and negative evidence we believe is most relevant to each significant jurisdiction  including a discussion of the significant assumptions related to our quarterly assessment and a discussion of the types and magnitude of changes in the factors that might indicate a further adjustment of the net deferred tax asset balance is required 
canada our net deferred tax assets in canada are recorded at nnl  the principal operating subsidiary of nnc 
we have concluded that because nnc does not have any substantive revenue generating activity  a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets is appropriate at nnc 
our analysis of cumulative profits in canada is focused specifically on nnl 
as of december   we have operated at a cumulative loss of over the most recent quarters 
prior to the incurrence of significant losses incurred in and  which led to the establishment of the valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets in canada  we had a strong history of earnings 
while our earnings since have been mixed including several periods of earnings and several periods with losses  the trend relative to and is clearly positive  which is reflected in the substantial decrease in our cumulative losses since additionally  our cumulative loss has decreased quarter over quarter in six of the last eight quarters 
the significant majority of our  net deferred tax asset at nnl relates to loss and investment tax credit carryforwards which have year carryforward periods 
approximately of our loss carryforwards are set to expire by the end of  and of our investment tax credits will expire by the end of however  there are tax planning strategies that permit the conversion of these loss and investment tax credit carryforwards into discretionary deductible expenses with an unlimited carryforward period 
as a result  we do not expect that a significant portion of our carryforwards will expire in the near future 
tax credit carryforward amounts of approximately with respect to the years from to have expired and are not included in the balance of gross deferred tax assets 
nortel can restore a significant amount of the deferred tax asset by executing a certain tax planning strategy that involves filing amended tax returns 
we have plans to implement these tax planning strategies in an effort to accelerate the utilization of our investment tax credits and loss carryforwards in canada 
currently these planning strategies can be implemented at minimal risk and cost 
these tax planning strategies are permissible based on existing canadian tax law 
we place significant weight on our ability to execute these planning strategies 
there is proposed legislation in canada which may significantly increase the cost of implementing our planning strategies  and may result in a significant amount of our investment tax credits expiring unused 
however  we have reviewed the proposed legislation and we believe we have provided adequate valuation allowance for the potential negative impact of the proposed legislation 
us as of december   we have operated at a cumulative loss in the us over the most recent quarters 
prior to the incurrence of significant losses in and  which led to the establishment of the valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets in the us  we had a strong history of earnings 
the us was near break even for the most recent quarters as of december   however  the restatement of earnings completed in april deferred a significant amount of the earnings from and prior years into and beyond 
as a result  the us remained in a cumulative loss position for the year ended december  however  the us operations had earnings of during the significant majority of our  net deferred tax assets in the us relates to loss and credit carryforwards which have a year carryforward period 
over of our research tax credits and over of our operating loss carryforwards do not begin to expire until as a result  we do not expect that a significant portion of our carryforwards will expire in the near future given our projections of future earnings 
unlike our carryforwards in canada  we do not rely upon any planning strategies to support the realization of the us losses and credits within the carryforward period  as we believe we will have sufficient earnings without the use of any planning strategies 
uk like canada and the us  our us operations have a strong history of earnings exclusive of the losses from and which created the current carryforwards in the uk however  unlike operations in those jurisdictions  the uk has exhibited strong earnings since and has cumulative profits over the most recent quarters 
we have provided a valuation allowance against a capital loss in the uk as such loss may only offset future capital gains  and we have provided a valuation allowance against certain losses from a now dormant entity 
otherwise  we have determined the remaining deferred tax assets in the uk will more likely than not be realized in future years 
france our france operations have operated at a cumulative loss in recent years and over the most recent quarters 
in addition  unlike our other significant jurisdictions  france does not have a strong history of earnings exclusive of the losses which created the current carryforwards 
as there is currently insufficient positive evidence to support deferred tax asset realization  we have provided a valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax assets in france  with the exception of certain credits and losses that may be redeemed in cash in future years 
transfer pricing we have considered the potential impact on our deferred tax assets that may result from settling our existing application for an advance pricing arrangement  or apa 
we have requested the apa apply to the through taxation years and we are in discussions with the taxing authorities about including the taxation year 
the apa is currently being negotiated by the pertinent taxing authorities us  canada  and uk we are not a party to the apa negotiations  but we do not believe the result of the negotiations will have an adverse impact on us or our deferred tax assets 
however  it is possible that the result of the apa negotiations could cause a material shift in historical earnings between various nortel entities 
such a shift in historical earnings could materially adjust the cumulative earnings loss calculation used as part of the analysis of positive negative evidence associated with the valuation allowance 
the years included in the apa negotiations are primarily tax loss years 
as such  the apa settlement could result in a reallocation of losses from one jurisdiction to another jurisdiction with canada and the us being the two primary jurisdictions for such reallocation 
the impact of the apa negotiations and ultimate settlement cannot be quantified by us at this time due to the uncertainties inherent in the negotiations between the tax authorities 
as such  this ultimate settlement position could have a substantial impact on our transfer pricing methodology for future years 
we continue to monitor the progress of the apa negotiations and will analyze the existence of new evidence when available as it relates to the apa 
we may make adjustments to the valuation allowance assessments  as appropriate  as additional evidence becomes available in future quarters 
during the year ended december   our gross income tax valuation allowance increased to  compared to  as of december  of the  increase  was primarily due to a valuation allowance being established relative to the realizability of the deferred tax asset established at nnc associated with future deduction of the shareholder settlement 
the remaining increase to the valuation allowance relates to the impacts of foreign exchange rates and other adjustments offset by additional valuation allowances recorded against the tax benefit of current period losses in certain jurisdictions 
we assessed positive evidence including forecasts of future taxable income to support realization of the net deferred tax assets  and negative evidence including our cumulative loss position  and concluded that the valuation allowances as of december  were appropriate 
we continue to review all available positive and negative evidence in each jurisdiction and our valuation allowance may need to be adjusted in the future as a result of this ongoing review 
given the magnitude of our valuation allowance  future adjustments to this allowance based on actual results could result in a significant adjustment to our net earnings loss 
tax contingencies we are subject to ongoing examinations by certain taxation authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we regularly assess the status of these examinations and the potential for adverse outcomes to determine the adequacy of the provision for income and other taxes 
we believe that we have adequately provided for tax adjustments that we believe are probable as a result of any ongoing or future examination 
specifically  the tax authorities in brazil have completed an examination of a prior taxation years and have issued assessments in the amount of we are currently in the process of appealing these assessments and believe that we have adequately provided for tax adjustments that are probable as a result of the outcome of the ongoing appeals process 
in addition  tax authorities in france have issued three preliminary notices of proposed assessment in respect of the  and taxation years 
these assessments collectively propose adjustments to taxable income of approximately  additional income tax liabilities of inclusive of interest  as well as certain adjustments to withholding and other taxes of approximately plus applicable interest and penalties 
other than the withholding and other taxes  we have sufficient loss carry forwards to offset the majority of the proposed assessment 
however  no amount has been provided for these assessments since we believe that the proposed assessments are without merit and any potential tax adjustments that could result from these ongoing examinations cannot be quantified at this time 
we made an offer of settlement to the french tax authorities  which was significantly less than the assessed amount  for the purpose of accelerating the settlement process to either the courts or competent authority proceedings under the canada france tax treaty 
we believe we have adequately provided for tax adjustments that are probable as a result of any ongoing or future examinations 
we had previously entered into apas with the taxation authorities of the us and canada in connection with our intercompany transfer pricing and cost sharing arrangements between canada and the us these arrangements expired in and in  we filed apa requests with the taxation authorities of the us  canada and the us that applied to the taxation years beginning in the apa requests are currently under consideration and we are in the process of negotiating the terms of the arrangement with the tax authorities 
we continue to monitor the progress of these negotiations  however we are not a party to them 
we have applied the transfer pricing methodology proposed in the apa requests in preparing our tax returns and accounts beginning in we had previously concluded that it was probable that the retroactive application of the proposed methodology to year would be accepted by the tax authorities and prepared our income tax estimates both current and deferred taxes on the basis that the taxation year would be governed by the apa submission 
as a result  we had previously provided approximately for taxes and interest in various tax jurisdictions that would be due as a result of retroactive application of the apa 
in the fourth quarter of  we obtained new information and as a result can no longer conclude that it is probable that the apa will be retroactively applied 
we have recalculated our current and deferred tax balances assuming the tax year would not be subject to the retroactive application of the apa 
as a result  the gross deferred income tax balances in our significant jurisdictions were recalculated on an as filed basis  and the liability of for taxes and interest that was previously accrued was released in the fourth quarter of the outcome of the apa applications is uncertain and possible additional losses as they relate to the apa negotiations cannot be determined at this time 
however  we do not believe it is probable that the ultimate resolution of these negotiations will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
despite our current belief  if this matter is resolved unfavorably  it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
goodwill valuation we test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis as of october of each year and at any other time if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
circumstances that could trigger an impairment test between annual tests include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  the likelihood that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of  a change in reportable segments  results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and or recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit 
the impairment test for goodwill is a two step process 
step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 
measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit is based on one or more fair value measures 
these measures involve significant management judgment and as a result are subject to change 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  step two requires the fair value of the reporting unit to be allocated to the underlying assets and liabilities of that reporting unit  resulting in an implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded in net earnings loss 
the fair value of each reporting unit is determined by allocating our total fair value among our reporting units using an average of three valuation models  a discounted cash flow  or dcf  model which is based on estimated revenue multiples  or the revenue multiple model  and a model based on a multiple of estimated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or the ebitda multiple model 
all of these valuation models involve significant assumptions regarding our future operating performance 
the following are the significant assumptions involved in each model dcf model assumptions regarding revenue growth rates  gross margin percentages  discount rates and terminal growth rates  revenue multiple model estimates of revenue growth and the selection of comparable companies to determine an appropriate multiple  and ebitda multiple model projected ebitda and the selection of comparable companies to determine an appropriate multiple 
the carrying value of goodwill was  of december  and  as of december  the decrease of was primarily driven by i an adjustment of related to the reduction of goodwill originally recorded as part of our investment in lg nortel and ii disposals of related to the transfer of our calgary manufacturing operations to flextronics and related to the sale of certain net assets related to our umts access business 
these decreases were partially offset by an addition of related to the goodwill acquired as a result of our acquisition of tasman networks and other adjustments of  which included an increase of resulting from the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our goodwill balances denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
due to the change in our operating segments and reporting units as described in business overview our segments  a triggering event occurred requiring a goodwill impairment test in the first and third quarters of in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas we performed this test and concluded that there was no impairment 
our four reportable segments and ngs comprise our reporting units 
as of our annual measurement date  the excess of fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units ranged from for ngs to in excess of for mccn 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test for ngs  we determined that a hypothetical reduction in the forecasted revenues for would result in a reduction in the excess of the fair value over the carrying value from to nil and if the reduction of forecasted revenues is greater  a partial impairment charge may be required 
the excess of fair value over the carrying value of our four reportable segments which accounts for of our consolidated goodwill  is in excess of  as such  a significant decrease in the fair value of these reporting units would be required to trigger goodwill impairment 
pension and post retirement benefits we maintain various pension and post retirement benefit plans for our employees globally 
these plans include significant pension and post retirement benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations 
key assumptions are made in determining these obligations and related expenses  including expected rates of return on plan assets and discount rates 
for  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate pension expenses was on a weighted average basis  which was the rate determined at september  this rate is down slightly from the rate of used in the discount rates used to estimate the net pension obligations and expenses for were and  respectively  on a weighted average basis  compared to and  respectively  in the key assumption used to estimate the post retirement benefit costs for was an expected discount rate of and for the obligations and costs  respectively  both on a weighted average basis 
the weighted average discount rate for the obligations remained the same as in and for the costs was down slightly from a rate of the difference between the discount rate reported for the net pension obligations and expenses and discount rate reported for the net post retirement benefit obligations and costs is due to the weighted average calculation as a result of the number of countries in which we offer either pension or pension and post retirement benefits 
in developing these assumptions  we evaluated  among other things  input from our actuaries  duration of the liabilities  and current high quality bond rates 
changes in net periodic pension and post retirement benefit expense may occur in the future due to changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events 
the following table highlights the sensitivity of our pension and post retirement benefit expense to changes in these assumptions  assuming all other assumptions remain constant effect on pre tax effect on pre tax post retirement change in assumption pension expense benefit expense increase decrease increase decrease percentage point increase in the expected return on assets n a percentage point decrease in the expected return on assets n a percentage point increase in the discount rate percentage point decrease in the discount rate plan assets were primarily comprised of debt and equity securities 
included in the equity securities of the defined benefit plan were common shares of nortel networks corporation  held directly or through pooled funds  with an aggregate market value of of total plan assets as of december  and of total plan assets as of december  actuarial gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss are being recognized over approximately an year period  which represents the weighted average expected remaining service life of the employee group 
actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on assets 
at the end of  we had net actuarial losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to the defined benefit plans of  which could result in an increase to pension expenses in future years depending on several factors  including whether such losses exceed the corridor in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
the post retirement benefit plans had an actuarial gain of included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the end of in the second quarter of  we announced changes to our north american pension and post retirement plans effective january  we will move employees currently enrolled in our defined benefit pension plans to defined contribution plans 
in addition  we will eliminate post retirement healthcare benefits for employees who are not age with five years of service as of july  as a result of these changes we re measured our pension and post retirement benefit obligations related to our north american plans as of the date our board of directors approved these changes and recorded the impacts of this re measurement in the third quarter of in accordance with sfas and sfas plan changes approved by our board of directors and changes to key assumptions as a result of the re measurement resulted in a curtailment gain of approximately for both the pension and post retirement benefit plans 
in addition  we were required to adjust the minimum pension liability for certain plans  representing the amount by which the accumulated benefit obligation less the fair value of the plan assets was greater than the recorded liability 
the effect of this adjustment and the related foreign currency translation adjustment was to decrease accumulated other comprehensive loss before tax by  decrease intangible assets by  and decrease pension liabilities by for the year end measurement  the impact of changes in discount rates and other accounting assumptions more than offset the favourable impacts of strong pension asset returns and our contributions made to the plans 
as a result  we were required to adjust the minimum pension liability for certain plans  representing the amount by which the accumulated benefit obligation less the fair value of the plan assets was greater than the recorded liability 
the effect of this adjustment and the related foreign currency translation adjustment was to increase accumulated other comprehensive loss before tax by  decrease intangible assets by and increase pension liabilities by the unfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans and post retirement plans was  as of the measurement date of september   as compared to  as of september  the decrease of is the result of the events described above which include the announced changes to our north american pension and post retirement plans announced in the second quarter of  changes in assumptions for the year end measurement  strong asset returns  and our contributions to the plans 
the full unfunded status is recorded as a liability on our balance sheet in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r  or sfas  issued by the fasb in september sfas requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit pension and post retirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity or changes in unrestricted net assets of a not for profit organization 
sfas also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position  with limited exceptions 
we are required to initially recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and post retirement plans and to provide the required disclosures as of december  the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position is effective for us for our fiscal year ending december  the effect of the initial adoption of sfas was as follows as at december  before application of after application of sfas adjustment sfas intangible assets net other assets long term deferred tax asset long term payroll and benefit liabilities current other liabilities long term accumulated other comprehensive loss during  we made cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans of and to our post retirement benefit plans of in  we expect to make cash contributions of approximately to our defined benefit pension plans and approximately to our post retirement benefit plans 
for  we are lowering our expected rate of return on plan assets from to for defined benefit pension plans 
also for  our discount rate on a weighted average basis for pension expenses will remain at for the defined benefit pension plans and at for post retirement benefit plans 
we will continue to evaluate our expected long term rates of return on plan assets and discount rates at least annually and make adjustments as necessary  which could change the pension and post retirement obligations and expenses in the future 
if the actual results of the plans differ from the assumptions  additional contributions by us may be required 
if we are required to make significant contributions to fund the defined benefit plans  reported results could be materially and adversely affected and our cash flow available for other uses may be significantly reduced 
special charges we record provisions for workforce reduction costs and exit costs when they are probable and estimable 
severance paid under ongoing benefit arrangements is recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for post employment benefits 
one time termination benefits and contract settlement and lease costs are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
at each reporting date  we evaluate our accruals related to workforce reduction charges  contract settlement and lease costs and plant and equipment write downs to ensure that these accruals are still appropriate 
as of december   we had in accruals related to workforce reduction charges and in accruals related to contract settlement and lease costs  which included significant estimates  primarily related to sublease income over the lease terms and other costs for vacated properties 
in certain instances  we may determine that these accruals are no longer required because of efficiencies in carrying out our restructuring work plan 
adjustments to workforce reduction accruals may also be required when employees previously identified for separation do not receive severance payments because they are no longer employed by us or were redeployed due to circumstances not foreseen when the original plan was initiated 
in these cases  we reverse any related accrual to earnings when it is determined it is no longer required 
alternatively  in certain circumstances  we may determine that certain accruals are insufficient as new events occur or as additional information is obtained 
in these cases  we would increase the applicable existing accrual with the offset recorded against earnings 
increases or decreases to the accruals for changes in estimates are classified within special charges in the statement of operations 
other contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
as a result  we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
we recognize a provision for an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
we are also subject to proceedings  lawsuits  investigations and other claims some of which may involve substantial dollar amounts  including proceedings under laws and government regulations related to securities  income and other taxes  environmental  labor  product and other matters which are in the normal course of business 
our restatements of our consolidated financial statements and related events have caused us to be subject to ongoing regulatory and criminal investigations and significant pending civil litigation actions in the us and canada 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes in any of these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of provision required  if any  for these contingencies is based on an analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
on february   we announced that we had reached a settlement in principle with the lead plaintiffs in two significant class action lawsuits 
as a result of the global class action settlement  we established a litigation reserve and recorded a charge to our full year financial results of   of which related to the equity component of the global class action settlement 
in  we recorded a shareholder litigation settlement recovery of as a result of a fair value mark to market adjustment of the equity component of the global class action settlement

the roll over method  the method previously used by us  focuses primarily on the material impact of a misstatement on the statement of operations  which can lead to the accumulation of misstatements on the balance sheet that may become material to the balance sheet 
the iron curtain method focuses primarily on the effect of correcting for the accumulated misstatements as at the balance sheet date  essentially correcting the balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the statement of operations 
sab requires quantification of financial statement misstatements under both the roll over and iron curtain approaches  referred to as the dual approach 
sab permits companies to initially adopt its provisions by adjusting for the cumulative effect of misstatements related to prior years  previously deemed to be immaterial  in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the current fiscal year  with an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit 
during the year of adoption sab also provides the option of prospective correction of immaterial errors in previously reported quarterly financial statements that would be reported as comparative information in future filings with the sec 
sab does not require financial statement reports previously filed with the sec to be amended 
sab became effective for our fiscal year ended december  the provisions of sab did not have a material impact on our results of operation and financial condition for the year ended december  recent accounting pronouncements please see note w significant accounting policies recent accounting pronouncements to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements 
in june  the fasb issued fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides accounting guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the evaluation of tax positions under fin will be a two step process  whereby we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  we would recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt the provisions of fin on january  we are currently in the process of assessing the impact of fin based on our preliminary analysis  we do not expect a significant adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as a result of the adoption of fin for additional information see note income taxes to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements

environmental matters we are exposed to liabilities and compliance costs arising from our past management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes 
as of december   the accruals on the consolidated balance sheet for environmental matters were based on information available as of december   we believe that the existing accruals are sufficient to satisfy probable and reasonably estimable environmental liabilities related to known environmental matters 
any additional liabilities that may result from these matters  and any additional liabilities that may result in connection with other locations currently under investigation  are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
we have remedial activities under way at sites which are either currently or previously owned or occupied facilities 
an estimate of our anticipated remediation costs associated with all such sites  to the extent probable and reasonably estimable  is included in the environmental accruals referred to above in an approximate amount of we are also listed as a potentially responsible party under the us comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla at four superfund sites in the us two potentially responsible party and two de minimis potentially responsible party 
an estimate of our share of the anticipated remediation costs associated with such superfund sites is included in the environmental accruals of referred to above 
liability under cercla may be imposed on a joint and several basis  without regard to the extent of our involvement 
in addition  the accuracy of our estimate of environmental liability is affected by several uncertainties such as additional requirements which may be identified in connection with remedial activities  the complexity and evolution of environmental laws and regulations  and the identification of presently unknown remediation requirements 
consequently  our liability could be greater than its current estimate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our consolidated financial statements through adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
to manage the risk from these fluctuations  we enter into various derivative hedging transactions that we have authorized under our policies and procedures 
we maintain risk management control systems to monitor market risks and counterparty risks 
these systems rely on analytical techniques including both sensitivity analysis and value at risk estimations 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
additional disclosure of our financial instruments is included in note  financial instruments and hedging activities to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
we manage foreign exchange exposures using forward and option contracts to hedge sale and purchase commitments 
our most significant foreign exchange exposures are in the canadian dollar  the british pound and the euro 
we enter into us to canadian dollar forward and option contracts intended to hedge the us to canadian dollar exposure on future revenues and expenditure streams 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  we recognize the gains and losses on the effective portion of these contracts in earnings when the hedged transaction occurs 
any ineffective portion of these contracts is recognized in earnings immediately 
we expect to continue to expand our business globally and  as such  expect that an increasing proportion of our business may be denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
as a result  fluctuations in foreign currencies may have a material impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we try to minimize the impact of such currency fluctuations through our ongoing commercial practices and by attempting to hedge our major currency exposures 
in attempting to manage this foreign exchange risk  we identify operations and transactions that may have exposure based upon the excess or deficiency of foreign currency receipts over foreign currency expenditures 
given our exposure to international markets  we regularly monitor all of our material foreign currency exposures 
our significant currency flows for the year ended december  were in us dollars  canadian dollars  british pounds and euros 
the net impact of foreign exchange fluctuations resulted in a loss of in  a gain of in and a gain of in we cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange gains or losses in the future 
however  if significant foreign exchange losses are experienced  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we use sensitivity analysis to measure our foreign currency risk by computing the potential decrease in cash flows that may result from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates 
the balances are segregated by source currency and a hypothetical unfavorable variance in foreign exchange rates of is applied to each net source currency position using year end rates to determine the potential decrease in cash flows over the next year 
the sensitivity analysis includes all foreign currency denominated cash  short term and long term debt  and derivative instruments that will impact cash flows over the next year that are held at december  and the underlying cash flows that relate to the hedged firm commitments are not included in the analysis 
the analysis is performed at the reporting date and assumes no future changes in the balances or timing of cash flows from the year end position 
further  the model assumes no correlation in the movement of foreign exchange rates 
based on a one year time horizon  a adverse change in exchange rates would have resulted in a potential decrease in after tax earnings increase in loss of as of december  and a potential decrease in after tax earnings increase in loss of as of december  this potential decrease would result primarily from our exposure to the canadian dollar  the british pound and the euro 
a portion of our long term debt is subject to changes in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates 
we have hedged a portion of this exposure to interest rate volatility using fixed for floating interest rate swaps 
the change in fair value of the swaps are recognized in earnings with offsetting amounts related to the change in the fair value of the hedged debt attributable to interest rate changes 
any ineffective portion of the swaps is recognized in income immediately 
we record net settlements on these swap instruments as adjustments to interest expense 
historically  we have managed interest rate exposures  as they relate to interest expense  using a diversified portfolio of fixed and floating rate instruments denominated in several major currencies 
we use sensitivity analysis to measure our interest rate risk 
the sensitivity analysis includes cash  our outstanding floating rate long term debt and any outstanding instruments that convert fixed rate long term debt to floating rate 
a basis point adverse change in interest rates would have resulted in a potential decrease in earnings increase in loss of as of december  and a potential decrease in earnings increase in loss of as of december  equity price risk the values of our equity investments in several publicly traded companies are subject to market price volatility 
these investments are generally in companies in the technology industry sector and are classified as available for sale 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate the market exposure on these investment securities 
we also hold certain derivative instruments or warrants that are subject to market price volatility because their value is based on the common share price of a publicly traded company 
these derivative instruments are generally acquired through business acquisitions or divestitures 
in addition  derivative instruments may also be purchased to hedge exposure to certain compensation obligations that vary based on future nortel networks corporation common share prices 
we do not hold equity securities or derivative instruments for trading purposes 
as of december   a hypothetical adverse change in the stock prices of our publicly traded equity securities and the related underlying stock prices of publicly traded equity securities for certain of our derivative instruments would result in a loss in their aggregate fair value of
