item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion and analysis of imperial s financial results  as well as the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements to which they refer  are the responsibility of the management of imperial oil limited 
the company s accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its straightforward business model involving the extracting  refining and marketing of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon based products 
the company s business involves the production or purchase  manufacture and sale of physical products  and all commercial activities are directly in support of the underlying physical movement of goods 
imperial  with its resource base  financial strength  disciplined investment approach and technology portfolio  is well positioned to participate in substantial investments to develop new canadian energy supplies 
while commodity prices remain volatile on a short term basis depending upon supply and demand  imperial s investment decisions are based on its long term outlook  using a disciplined approach in selecting and pursuing the most attractive investment opportunities 
the corporate plan is a fundamental annual management process that is the basis for setting risk assessed  near term operating and capital objectives  in addition to providing the longer term economic assumptions used for investment evaluation purposes 
potential investment opportunities are tested over a wide range of economic scenarios to establish the resiliency of each opportunity 
once investments are made  a reappraisal process is completed to ensure relevant lessons are learned and improvements are incorporated into future projects 

table of contents business environment and outlook natural resources imperial produces crude oil and natural gas for sale into large north american markets 
economic and population growth are expected to remain the primary drivers of energy demand  globally and in north america 
the company expects the global economy to grow at an average rate of slightly less than three percent per year through the combination of population and economic growth should lead to an increase in demand for primary energy at an average rate slightly less than two percent annually 
the vast majority of this increase is expected to occur in developing countries 
oil  gas and coal are expected to remain the predominant energy sources with approximately percent share of total energy 
oil and gas alone are expected to maintain close to a percent share 
over the same period  the canadian economy is expected to grow at an average rate of about two percent per year  and canadian demand for energy at a rate of about one percent per year 
oil and gas are expected to continue to supply two thirds of canadian energy demand 
it is expected that canada will also be a growing supplier of energy to us markets through this period 
oil products are the transportation fuel of choice for the world s fleet of cars  trucks  trains  ships and airplanes 
primarily because of increased demand in developing countries  oil consumption will increase by percent or about million barrels a day by canada s resources of heavy oil and oil sands represent an important additional source of supply 
natural gas is expected to be a major primary energy source globally  capturing about one third of all incremental energy growth and approaching one quarter of global energy supplies 
natural gas production from mature established regions in the united states and canada is not expected to meet increasing demand  strengthening the market opportunities for new gas supply from canada s frontier areas 
crude oil and natural gas prices are determined by global and north american markets and are subject to changing supply and demand conditions 
these can be influenced by a wide range of factors  including economic conditions  international political developments and weather 
in the past  crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile  and the company expects that volatility to continue 
imperial has a large and diverse portfolio of oil and gas resources in canada  both developed and undeveloped  which helps reduce the risks of dependence on potentially limited supply sources in the upstream 
with the relative maturity of conventional production in the established producing areas of western canada  imperial s production is expected to come increasingly from frontier and unconventional sources  particularly heavy oil  oil sands and natural gas from the far north  where imperial has large undeveloped resource opportunities 
petroleum products the downstream industry environment remains very competitive 
while refining margins in were strong  long term real refining margins globally have declined at a rate of about one percent per year over the past years 
intense competition in the retail fuels market similarly has driven down real margins 
refining margins are the difference between what a refinery pays for its raw materials primarily crude oil and the wholesale market prices for the range of products produced primarily gasoline  diesel fuel  heating oil  jet fuel and heavy fuel oil 
crude oil and many products are widely traded with published international prices 
prices for those commodities are determined by the marketplace  often an international marketplace  and are affected by many factors  including global and regional supply demand balances  inventory levels  refinery operations  import export balances  transportation logistics  seasonality and weather 
canadian wholesale prices in particular are largely determined by wholesale prices in adjacent us regions 
these prices and factors are continually monitored and provide input to operating decisions about which raw materials to buy  facilities to operate and products to make 
however  there are no reliable indicators of future market factors that accurately predict changes in margins from period to period 
imperial s downstream strategies are to provide customers with quality service at the lowest total cost offer  have the lowest unit costs among our competitors  ensure efficient and effective use of capital and capitalize on integration with the company s other businesses 
imperial owns and operates four refineries in canada  with distillation capacity of  barrels a day and lubricant manufacturing capacity of  barrels a day 
imperial s fuels marketing business includes retail operations across canada serving customers through about  esso branded service stations  of which about are company owned or leased  and wholesale and industrial operations through a network of primary distribution terminals  as well as a secondary distribution network 
chemicals although the current business environment is favourable  the north american petrochemical industry is cyclical 
the company s strategy for its chemicals business is to reduce costs and maximize value by continuing to increase the integration of its chemicals plants at sarnia and dartmouth with the refineries

partially offsetting these positive factors were the impacts of a stronger canadian dollar of about million  lower natural gas realizations of about million  lower gains on asset divestments of about million  higher planned refinery maintenance and capital project effects of about million and a heavier mix of resources volumes of about million 
natural resources net income from natural resources was a record  million  exceeding the previous record achieved in of  million  million 
cold lake heavy oil and conventional crude oil realizations were stronger by about million compared with these positive items were partially offset by lower natural gas realizations of about million and the negative impact of a higher canadian dollar of about million 
the impact of natural resources volumes was unfavourable by about million due to mix effects with lower conventional crude oil volumes being partially offset by higher syncrude volumes 
higher production at cold lake was essentially offset by higher royalties 
tax expense in was lower by about million  primarily from reductions in federal and alberta tax rates and higher benefits from resolution of tax matters 
gains from asset divestments were lower by about million compared with financial statistics millions of dollars net income operating revenues world crude oil prices  denominated in us dollars  were higher in than in the previous year 
the annual average price of brent crude oil  the most actively traded north sea crude and a common benchmark of world oil markets  was about us a barrel in  a more than percent increase over the average price of in 
however  the company s canadian dollar realizations for conventional crude oil increased to a lesser extent because of a stronger canadian dollar 
average realizations for conventional crude oil during the year were cdn a barrel  an increase of six percent from in 
average realizations for cold lake heavy oil were higher by over percent in  reflecting both increases in light crude oil prices and a narrowing price spread between light crude oil and cold lake heavy oil more consistent with historical trend levels

production from the syncrude oil sands operation  in which the company has a percent interest  was higher during as a result of lower maintenance activities and new production volume from the new coker unit at the stage expansion project 
gross production of upgraded crude oil increased to  barrels a day from 
table of contents  barrels in 
imperial s share of average gross production increased to  barrels a day from  barrels in 
gross production of conventional oil decreased to  barrels a day from  barrels in  as a result of the impact of divested properties and the natural decline in western canadian reservoirs 
gross production of ngls available for sale averaged  barrels a day in  down from  barrels in  mainly due to the declining ngl content of wizard lake gas production 
gross production of natural gas decreased to million cubic feet a day from million cubic feet in million

c production of natural gas includes amounts used for internal consumption with the exception of the amounts reinjected 
operating costs decreased by one percent in lower energy and other operating costs more than offset higher syncrude expenses 
in november  the company announced plans to enter into a management services agreement with syncrude canada ltd  the operating company for the syncrude joint venture 
the company has a final checkpoint in the second quarter of to confirm or cancel the agreement following completion of an opportunity assessment study 
petroleum products net income from petroleum products was million or cents a litre in  compared with million or cents a litre in million or cents a litre 
earnings were negatively impacted by higher planned refinery maintenance and ultra low sulphur diesel project activities  which impacted both refinery utilization and expenses by a total of about million versus the prior year 
lower product sales volumes during the year were primarily a result of lower refinery production and had limited impact on earnings  as the reduction was primarily in lower margin refining and marketing sales channels 
earnings were also negatively impacted by a stronger canadian dollar of about million 
these factors were partially offset by the net positive effect of resolution of tax matters and the impact of the tax rate change  totalling about million  and stronger refining and marketing margins

table of contents operating costs in the chemicals segment for were about four percent lower than  reflecting lower direct operating expenses 
corporate and other net income from corporate and other was negative million in  compared with negative million in negative million 
favourable earnings effects were due mainly to lower share based compensation expenses 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash millions of dollars cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at end of year although the company issues long term debt from time to time and maintains a revolving commercial paper program  internally generated funds cover the majority of its financial requirements 
the management of cash that may be temporarily available as surplus to the company s immediate needs is carefully controlled  both to optimize returns on cash balances and to ensure that it is secure and readily available to meet the company s cash requirements as they arise 
cash flows from operating activities are highly dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices and product margins 
in addition  the company will need to continually find and develop new resources  and continue to develop and apply new technologies and recovery processes to existing fields  in order to maintain or increase production and resulting cash flows in future periods 
projects are in place or underway to increase production capacity 
however  these volume increases are subject to a variety of risks  including project execution  operational outages  reservoir performance and regulatory changes 
the company s financial strength enables it to make large  long term capital expenditures 
imperial s large and diverse portfolio of development opportunities and the complementary nature of its business segments help mitigate the overall risks of the company and associated cash flow 
further  due to its financial strength  debt capacity and diverse portfolio of opportunities  the risk associated with failure or delay of any single project would not have a significant impact on the company s liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash flows for its operations and fixed commitments 
cash flow from operating activities cash provided by operating activities was  million  versus  million in  million 
increases in cash flow in were driven primarily by higher net income and lower overall working capital balances 
capital and exploration expenditures total capital and exploration expenditures were  million in  compared with  million in  million 
the funds were used mainly to invest in cold lake and syncrude to maintain and expand production capacity  improve operating efficiency  reduce the sulphur content of diesel fuel and upgrade the network of esso retail outlets 
about million was spent on projects related to reducing the environmental impact of the company s operations and improving safety  including about million on the million project to produce ultra low sulphur diesel 
the following table shows the company s capital and exploration expenditures for natural resources during the five years ending december  millions of dollars exploration production heavy oil and oil sands total capital and exploration expenditures for the natural resources segment  about percent of the capital and exploration expenditures in was focused on growth opportunities 
significant expenditures during the year were made to ongoing development 
table of contents drilling at cold lake and to syncrude for the company s share of the stage upgrader expansion project 
sustained operation of the upgrader expansion project began in august  following a prolonged start up period 
other investment included drilling at conventional fields in western canada  advancing the mackenzie gas and kearl oil sands projects  and exploration off the east coast of canada 
the mackenzie gas project is facing significant cost and schedule pressures brought on by unprecedented global demands for energy infrastructure 
there are also uncertainties related to the regulatory and permitting process and the remaining benefits and access agreements 
the company s current work efforts are focused on completing regulatory hearings  advancing approval of permits  finalizing remaining benefits and access agreements  establishing an appropriate fiscal framework with the federal government  advancing potential shipping agreements and continuing paced engineering  technical and cost reduction efforts 
regulatory hearings by the joint federal and provincial review panel on the kearl oil sands project were completed in november and a decision is expected in early the company s current efforts are focused on design optimization to improve project economics and reduce project execution risk 
once this work is completed and a regulatory decision is received  project timing will be determined 
drilling of a wildcat exploration well began with co venturers in the orphan basin  a frontier basin located off the east coast of newfoundland 
two more exploration wells are planned by the end of imperial holds a percent interest in eight deepwater exploration licences in the basin 
planned capital and exploration expenditures in natural resources are expected to be about million in  with over percent of the total focused on growth opportunities 
investments are mainly planned for development drilling at cold lake and conventional oil and gas operations in western canada  facilities improvement at syncrude  the mackenzie gas project  the kearl oil sands project and exploration off the east coast

the company invested about million in refining operations and other facilities during the year as part of a three year  million project to reduce sulphur content in diesel 
the project was completed in and the company was able to fully meet all new government regulations on ultra low sulphur diesel from all of its facilities across canada by the required schedules 
more than million was invested in other refinery projects to improve energy efficiency and increase yield 
major investments were also made to upgrade the network of esso service stations during the year 
capital expenditures for the petroleum products segment in are expected to be about million 
major items include additional investment in the refineries on improving energy efficiencies and increasing yield and continued enhancements to the company s retail network

table of contents the company was contingently liable at december   for a maximum of million relating to guarantees for purchasing operating equipment and other assets from its rural marketing associates upon expiry of the associate agreement or the resignation of the associate 
the company expects that the fair value of the operating equipment and other assets so purchased would cover the maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantees 
various lawsuits are pending against imperial oil limited and its subsidiaries 
based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances  the company does not believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuits against the company will have a material  adverse effect on the company s operations or financial condition

recently issued statement of financial accounting standards accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin is an interpretation of fasb statement no 
accounting for income taxes and must be adopted by the company no later than january  the interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing  measuring  presenting and disclosing in the financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take in its tax returns 
the new standard requires that a tax benefit be recognized in the books only if it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained 
otherwise  a liability will need to be recorded to reflect the difference between the as filed tax basis and the book tax basis 
the new standard does not allow a restatement of the comparative prior periods 
the company expects to recognize a transition gain of approximately million in shareholders equity upon adoption of fin in the first quarter of this gain reflects the recognition of several refund claims and associated interest  partly offset by increased liability reserves 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap and include estimates that reflect management s best judgment 
the company s accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its straightforward business model 
imperial does not use financing structures for the purpose of altering accounting outcomes or removing debt from the balance sheet 
the following summary provides further information about the critical accounting policies and the estimates that are made by the company to apply those policies 
it should be read in conjunction with note to the consolidated financial statements on page f hydrocarbon reserves proved oil  gas and synthetic crude oil reserve quantities are used as the basis of calculating unit of production rates for depreciation and evaluating for impairment 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs and deposits under existing economic and operating conditions 
estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are based on detailed geological and engineering assessments of in place crude bitumen volume  the mining plan  historical extraction recovery and upgrading yield factors  installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits 
the estimation of proved reserves is controlled by the company through long standing approval guidelines 
reserve changes are made with a well established  disciplined process driven by senior level geoscience and engineering professionals assisted by a central reserves group with significant technical experience  culminating in reviews with and approval by senior management and the company s board of directors 
notably  the company does not use specific quantitative reserve targets to determine compensation 
key features of the estimation include rigorous peer reviewed technical evaluations and analysis of well and field performance information and a requirement that management make significant funding commitment toward the development of the reserves prior to booking 
although the company is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced  the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors  including completion of development projects  reservoir performance and significant changes in long term oil and gas price levels 
beginning in  the year end reserves volumes as well as the reserves change categories shown in the proved reserves tables are calculated using december prices and costs 
these reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit of production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flow 
regulations preclude the company from showing in this document the reserves that are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the basis that the company uses to make its investment decisions 
the use of year end prices for reserves estimation introduces short term price volatility into the process 
table of contents since annual adjustments are required based on prices occurring on a single day 
the company believes that this approach is inconsistent with the long term nature of the natural resources business where production from individual projects often spans multiple decades 
the use of prices from a single date is not relevant to the investment decisions made by the company  and annual variations in reserves based on such year end prices are not of consequence to how the business is actually managed 
revisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or revaluation of already available geologic  reservoir or production data  new geologic  reservoir or production data  or changes in year end prices and costs that are used in determination of reserves 
this category can also include changes associated with the performance of improved recovery projects and significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment facility capacity 
the company uses the successful efforts method to account for its exploration and production activities 
under this method  costs are accumulated on a field by field basis with certain exploratory expenditures and exploratory dry holes being expensed as incurred 
costs of productive wells and development dry holes are capitalized and amortized on the unit of production method for each field 
the company uses this accounting policy instead of the full cost method because it provides a more timely accounting of the success or failure of the company s exploration and production activities 
impact of reserves on depreciation the calculation of unit of production depreciation is a critical accounting estimate that measures the depreciation of natural resources assets 
it is the ratio of actual volumes produced to total proved developed reserves those reserves recoverable through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods applied to the asset cost 
the volumes produced and asset cost are known and  while proved developed reserves have a high probability of recoverability  they are based on estimates that are subject to some variability 
while the revisions the company has made in the past are an indicator of variability  they have had little impact on the unit of production rates of depreciation 
impact of reserves and prices on testing for impairment proved oil and gas properties held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
the company estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts 
in general  impairment analyses are based on proved reserves 
where probable reserves exist  an appropriately risk adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the impairment evaluation 
an asset would be impaired if the undiscounted cash flows were less than its carrying value 
impairments are measured by the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
the impairment evaluation triggers include a significant decrease in current and projected prices or reserve volumes  an accumulation of project costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected and historical and current operating losses 
in general  the company does not view temporarily low oil and gas prices as a triggering event for conducting impairment tests 
the markets for crude oil and natural gas have a history of significant price volatility 
although prices will occasionally drop significantly  industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand 
accordingly  any impairment tests that the company performs make use of the company s price assumptions developed in the annual planning and budgeting process for the crude oil and natural gas markets  petroleum products and chemicals 
these are the same price assumptions that are used for capital investment decisions 
the corporate plan is a fundamental annual management process that is the basis for setting near term risk assessed operating and capital objectives in addition to providing the longer term economic assumptions used for investment evaluation purposes 
any impairment tests that the company performs also make use of annual volumes based on individual field production profiles  which are also updated as part of the annual plan process 
the standardized measure of discounted future cash flows on page is based on the year end price applied for all future years  as required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
future prices used for any impairment tests will vary from the one used in the sfas disclosure and could be lower or higher for any given year 
pension benefits the company s pension plan is managed in compliance with the requirements of governmental authorities and meets funding levels as determined by independent third party actuaries 
pension accounting requires explicit assumptions regarding  among others  the discount rate for the benefit obligations  the expected rate of return on plan assets and the long term rate of future compensation increases 
all pension assumptions are reviewed annually by senior management 
these assumptions are adjusted only as appropriate to reflect long term changes 
table of contents in market rates and outlook 
the long term expected rate of return on plan assets of percent used in compares to actual returns of percent and percent achieved over the last and year periods ending december  if different assumptions are used  the expense and obligations could increase or decrease as a result 
the company s potential exposure to changes in assumptions is summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements on page f at imperial  differences between actual returns on plan assets versus long term expected returns are not recorded in pension expense in the year the differences occur  but rather are amortized in pension expense as permitted by gaap  along with other actuarial gains and losses  over the expected remaining service life of employees 
pension expense represented less than one percent of total expenses in asset retirement obligations and other environmental liabilities legal obligations associated with site restoration on the retirement of assets with determinable useful lives are recognized when they are incurred  which is typically at the time the assets are installed 
the obligations are initially measured at fair value and discounted to present value 
over time  the discounted asset retirement obligation amount will be accreted for the change in its present value  with this effect included in operating expense 
as payments to settle the obligations occur on an ongoing basis and will continue over the lives of the operating assets  which can exceed years  the discount rate will be adjusted only as appropriate to reflect long term changes in market rates and outlook 
for  the obligations were discounted at six percent and the accretion expense was million  before tax  which was significantly less than one percent of total expenses in the year 
there would be no material impact on the company s reported financial results if a different discount rate had been used 
asset retirement obligations are not recognized for assets with an indeterminate useful life 
asset retirement obligations for these facilities generally become firm at the time the facilities are permanently shut down and dismantled 
these obligations may include the costs of asset disposal and additional soil remediation 
however  these sites have indeterminate lives based on plans for continued operations  and as such  the fair value of the conditional legal obligations cannot be measured  since it is impossible to estimate the future settlement dates of such obligations 
for these and non operating assets  the company accrues provisions for environmental liabilities when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
asset retirement obligations and other environmental liabilities are based on engineering estimated costs  taking into account the anticipated method and extent of remediation consistent with legal requirements  current technology and the possible use of the location 
since these estimates are specific to the locations involved  there are many individual assumptions underlying the company s total asset retirement obligations and provision for other environmental liabilities 
while these individual assumptions can be subject to change  none of them is individually significant to the company s reported financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of financial  operating and market risks in the course of its business 
some of these risks are within the company s control  while others are not 
for those risks that can be controlled  specific risk management strategies are employed to reduce the likelihood of loss 
in october  the government of canada indicated its intent to introduce regulations to control greenhouse gas emissions from major industrial facilities  although details of what measures will be imposed on companies have not been determined 
consequently  attempts to assess the impact on imperial can only be speculative 
the company will continue to monitor the development of legal requirements in this area 
other risks  such as changes in international commodity prices and currency exchange rates  are beyond the company s control 
the company s size  strong financial position and the complementary nature of its natural resources  petroleum products and chemicals segments help mitigate the company s exposure to changes in these other risks 
the company s potential exposure to these types of risks is summarized in the earnings sensitivity table below 
the company does not use derivative markets to speculate on the future direction of currency or commodity prices and does not sell forward any part of production from any business segment
