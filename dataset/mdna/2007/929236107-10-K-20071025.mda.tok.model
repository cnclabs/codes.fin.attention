gross profit gross profit was million  or of sales in fiscal year  compared to million  or of sales in fiscal year although gross margin percentage was slightly up  the company continued to experience increases in costs of products  which have negatively affected gross margins in all of the company s regions 
the rise in costs of products has been due to the significant increase in costs for components and raw materials  including aerosol cans and petroleum based products  as well as a change in product mix 
the mix of products sold in fiscal year included an increased amount of higher cost promotional offerings 
as a result of the general upward trend of costs in the market  we remain concerned about the possibility of continued rising costs of components  raw materials and finished goods 
the increase in pricing of certain products worldwide  which occurred during last fiscal year s third quarter  partially offset the rise in costs of products and added approximately to gross margin percentage in fiscal year compared to fiscal year although the price increases helped to mitigate the impact of rising costs on gross margin percentage  the benefit from the price increases was partially offset by the continued cost increases  as well as changes in product mix 
in an effort to further reduce the impact of increased costs on gross margin percentage  the company has begun to implement several cost savings projects 
these projects were identified by a cost reduction team that is focused on gross margin improvement  which includes supply chain cost savings initiatives 
additionally  the company believes that innovation will be a key factor in improving gross margin percentage in the long term 
the rise in costs of products was also partially offset by a decrease in advertising  promotional and other discounts  which are recorded as a reduction to sales 
the decrease in advertising  promotional and other discounts positively impacted gross margin percentage by 
this decrease resulted from both timing and reductions in discounts offered during the fiscal year 
examples of advertising  promotional and other discounts include coupon redemptions  consideration and allowances given to retailers for space in their stores  consideration and allowances given to obtain favorable display positions in retailers stores  co operative advertising and promotional activity  volume discounts and other one time or ongoing incentives 
the timing of these activities  as well as shifts in product mix  may cause fluctuations in gross margin percentage from period to period 
note that the company s gross margins may not be comparable to those of other reporting entities  since some entities include all costs related to distribution of their products in cost of products sold  whereas we exclude the portion associated with amounts paid to third parties for distribution to our customers from our contract packagers  and include these costs in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a in fiscal year increased to million  or of sales  from million  or of sales  in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in sg a was largely attributable to increases in employee related costs  professional services costs  miscellaneous expenses and the impact of foreign currency translation 
certain employee related costs  which include salaries  profit sharing and other fringe benefits  increased million versus the prior fiscal year as a result of annual compensation increases  relocation expenses and additional staffing to support global sourcing and inventory management  direct operations in china and product introductions 
the increase in the above employee related costs was partially offset by a million decrease in bonus expense as several regions did not achieve profit and performance targets that had been met in the prior fiscal year 
costs for professional services increased million primarily as a result of increased legal costs 
miscellaneous expenses increased million  which included increased commissions  meeting expenses  travel costs and bad debt expense 
also contributing to the increase in sg a was million related to foreign currency exchange rates 
fiscal year sg a expenses translated at last fiscal year s exchange rates would have produced total sg a expenses of million 
the company continued its research and development investment in support of its focus on innovation and renovation 
research and development costs were million in each of fiscal years and the company s new product development team  known as team tomorrow  engages in consumer research  product development  current product improvement and testing activities

advertising and sales promotion expenses advertising and sales promotion expenses increased to million in fiscal year  up from million in fiscal year and  as a percentage of sales  decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase was related to increased consumer broadcast  print media and other advertising activities in the us  europe and australia 
as a percentage of sales  advertising and sales promotion expenses may fluctuate period to period based upon the type of marketing activities employed by the company and the period in which the costs are incurred 
the costs of certain promotional activities are required to be recorded as reductions to sales  while others remain in advertising and sales promotion expenses 
in fiscal year  the total promotional costs recorded as reductions to sales were million versus million in fiscal year therefore  the company s total investment in advertising and sales promotion activities totaled million in fiscal year versus million in fiscal year amortization of intangible asset expense amortization of intangible asset expense was  in fiscal year  compared to  in the prior fiscal year

the change in interest expense  net was primarily due to the reduced principal balance on long term borrowings resulting from the annual million principal payments made in october and october  as well as to increased interest income resulting from higher cash balances in fiscal year versus the prior fiscal year 
other income  net other income  net was  in fiscal year compared to  in the prior fiscal year  a decrease of  which was due to foreign currency exchange losses in fiscal year compared to foreign currency exchange gains in the prior fiscal year 
other income  net also includes rental income from vml company llc the company owns and rents a warehouse facility to vml in memphis  tennessee 
vml serves as the company s contract manufacturer for certain household products and acts as a warehouse distributor for other product lines of the company 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was of income before income taxes in fiscal year  a decrease from in fiscal year the decrease in tax rate was primarily due to favorable rulings on foreign tax matters  a one time benefit from the extraterritorial income eti deduction from prior years and the impact of the expiration of federal statutes of limitations 
these items created one time benefits that totaled approximately million in tax benefits 
the company does not anticipate tax benefits of this nature to be ongoing 
additionally  the tax benefit from municipal bond interest also contributed to the decrease in the fiscal year tax rate 
the overall decrease in tax rate was partially offset by the impact of reduced low income housing credits and the phase out of the eti deduction in the current fiscal year 
net income net income was million  or per common share on a fully diluted basis for the fiscal year ended august   compared to million  or per common share for the prior fiscal year

price increases implemented on certain products during the third quarter of fiscal year also contributed to the overall lubricant sales growth in the americas in fiscal year the increase in wd sales was partially offset by a decrease in in one sales in the us  which was the result of lost distribution to a key customer 
household product sales in fiscal year were down million  or  compared to fiscal year primarily due to declines in the us sales in the us decreased by million  or  due to lower sales of spot shot  x  flushes and carpet fresh

spot shot sales declined in the us during fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year due to reduced sales to key customers  declines in the aerosol spot and stain category  significant competitor activity and reduced promotional activity 
during the first quarter of the current fiscal year  a key customer temporarily replaced spot shot with seasonal items  which had not occurred in the prior fiscal year first quarter 
the company regained distribution with this customer during the second quarter of the current fiscal year 
additionally  certain promotional activity during the prior fiscal year was not repeated in fiscal year the declines in the aerosol category are due to retailers reducing shelf space for aerosol spot and stain removers 
this decrease was partially offset by expanded distribution of the spot shot trigger product with a key customer and increased distribution in the grocery trade channel versus the prior fiscal year 
the spot shot trigger product competes in the non aerosol spot and stain category  which is larger than the aerosol spot and stain category 
the company has also committed both marketing and research and development resources to support and to create innovation for the spot shot brand to take advantage of key trends in the marketplace and expand its distribution base

sales of carpet fresh in the us declined in fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year due to competitor activity  category declines in the mass retail and grocery trade channels  promotional timing and the timing of sales to a key customer versus the prior fiscal year

preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
management uses historical experience and other relevant factors when developing estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated 
note to the company s consolidated financial statements includes a discussion of significant accounting policies 
the accounting policies discussed below are the ones management considers critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment 
the company s financial results may have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed 
the company s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition sales are recognized as revenue at the time of delivery to the customer when risk of loss and title pass 
management must make judgments and certain assumptions in the determination of when delivery occurs

valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill the company assesses the potential impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for goodwill and intangibles determined to have indefinite lives  impairment is tested at least annually under the guidance of sfas no 
 during our second fiscal quarter of each year unless there are indicators during an interim period that assets may have become impaired 
the company s impairment test is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgment and estimates  such as forecasted revenue  advertising and promotional expenses  cost of products sold  gross margins  operating margins  the success of product innovations and introductions  customer retention and the selection of appropriate discount and royalty rates 
management judgments and estimates are based on assumptions that are most reasonably likely to occur 
for goodwill  impairment occurs when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit 
for intangible assets  impairment occurs when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value 
in addition  intangible assets with indefinite lives are evaluated quarterly to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
events and circumstances that we consider important which could trigger impairment include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business significant negative industry or economic trends significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period decreased market capitalization relative to net book value unanticipated technological change or competitive activities loss of key distribution loss of key personnel acts by government and courts when there is indication that the carrying value of intangibles or long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  an impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
when there is an indication of impairment of goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company tested its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment based on future discounted cash flows compared to related book values 
based on this review  the company determined that there were no instances of impairment 
if the fair values of the company s goodwill and intangible assets  as calculated during the annual impairment test  were reduced by  there would still be no instances of impairment
