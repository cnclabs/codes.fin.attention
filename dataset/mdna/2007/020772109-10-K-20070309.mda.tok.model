item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our selected five year financial data  our consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements  which appear elsewhere in this report 
cautionary statement for forward looking information certain information set forth in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws 
forward looking statements include statements concerning our plans  objectives  goals  strategies  future events  future revenues or performance  capital expenditures  financing needs  plans or intentions relating to potential acquisitions and other information that is not historical information 
when used in this report  the words estimates  expects  anticipates  forecasts  plans  intends  believes and variations of such words or similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
we may make additional forward looking statements from time to time 
all forward looking statements  whether written or oral and whether made by us or on our behalf  are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods 
we base estimates on past experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the application of these accounting policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide timely and reliable financial information 
our critical accounting polices include the following inventories inventories include freight in  materials  labor and overhead costs and are stated at the lower of cost computed on a standard cost basis  which approximates average cost or market 
provision is made for slow moving  obsolete or unusable inventory 
we assess our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory and write down the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future sales and supply on hand  if necessary 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
revenue recognition for sales transactions  we comply with the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which states that revenue should be recognized when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes the risk of loss  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
these criteria are satisfied upon shipment of product and revenues are recognized accordingly 
sales are reduced for any anticipated sales returns  rebates and allowances based on historical experience 
since our return policy is only days and our products are not generally susceptible to external factors such as technological obsolescence or significant changes in demand  we are able to make a reasonable estimate for returns 
we offer end user product specific and sales volume rebates to select distributors 
our rebates are based on actual sales and accrued monthly 
stock based compensation the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r effective january   using the modified prospective application method 
sfas r requires companies to record compensation expense for the value of all outstanding and unvested share based payments  including employee stock options and similar awards 
as of december   the company had no outstanding and unvested share based awards 
during the third quarter of   stock options were granted under the option plan 
as a result  the company recognized  in share based compensation expense in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company accounted for its stock based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
no stock based employee compensation cost was reflected in net income as all options granted under those stock based employee compensation plans had exercise prices equal to the market values of the underlying common shares on the dates of grant 
the fair values of stock option grants are determined using the black scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions expected stock price volatility based on historic and management s expectations of future volatility  risk free interest rates from published sources  weighted average expected option lives based on historical data and no dividend yield  as management currently does not intend to pay dividends in the near future 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and that are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility 
our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect their fair value 
overview alpha pro tech is in the business of protecting people  products and environments 
we accomplish this by developing  manufacturing and marketing a line of high value disposable protective apparel and infection control products for the cleanroom  industrial  pharmaceutical  medical and dental markets 
we also manufacture and distribute a line of medical bed pads and accessories as well as a line of pet beds 
our products are sold both under the alpha pro tech brand name as well as under private label 
in  we commenced sales from a new business segment  alpha protech engineered products  inc engineered products  a wholly owned subsidiary of alpha pro tech 
this segment consists of a line of construction supply weatherization products as well as a line of paint with antimicrobials 
the construction supply weatherization products consists of house wrap and a synthetic roof underlayment 
the line of paint with antimicrobials is designed to inhibit growth of bacteria  fungi and algae on the painted surfaces in hospitals  surgical rooms and cleanrooms and associated controlled environments 
in addition to our paint with antimicrobials  we have also developed a line of sealants with antimicrobials to be used for mold remediation 
the engineered products segment is expected to contribute significantly to revenue growth in this line of products is a natural extension of our core capabilities creating proprietary products designed to protect people and environments 
the house wrap offers a weather resistant barrier designed to lower energy consumption costs 
the proprietary synthetic roof underlayment is designed to resist the environment  as opposed to conventional roofing underlayment that is prone to rapid degradation and mold growth 
our products are classified into six groups disposable protective apparel  consisting of a complete line of shoecovers  bouffant caps  gowns  coveralls and lab coats  infection control products  consisting of a line of face masks and eye shields  extended care products  consisting of a line of medical bed pads  wheelchair covers  geriatric chair surfaces  operating room table surfaces and pediatric surfaces  a line of pet beds  construction weatherization products  consisting of house wrap and synthetic roof underlayment  and a line of paint with antimicrobials designed to inhibit growth of bacteria  fungi and algae on painted surfaces 
our products as classified above are grouped into four business segments 
the disposable protective apparel segment  consisting of disposable protective apparel  the infection control segment  consisting of face masks and eye shields  the extended care segment  consisting of extended care products  namely medical bed pads and pet beds  and the engineered products segment  consisting of construction weatherization products such as house wrap and synthetic roof underlayment as well as a line of antimicrobial paint 
our target markets are pharmaceutical manufacturing  bio pharmaceutical manufacturing and medical device manufacturing  lab animal research  high technology electronics manufacturing which includes the semi conductor market  medical and dental distributors  pet stores and pet distributors and construction supply and roofing distributors 
our products are used primarily in cleanrooms  industrial safety manufacturing environments  health care facilities such as hospitals  laboratories and dental offices  as well as construction supply sites 
our pet beds are used by pet owners and veterinarians 
our products are distributed principally in the united states through a network consisting of purchasing groups  national distributors  local distributors  independent sales representatives and our own sales and marketing force 
consolidated sales for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december   representing an increase of  or 
revenue for the engineered products segment for the year ended december  and was  and  respectively 
this segment showed million or growth in and is expected to grow significantly in in we entered into two agreements with perma r products  inc for the distribution of house wrap and synthetic roof underlayment 
as part of these year mutually exclusive agreements  they agreed to purchase a minimum of million per year in house wrap and million in synthetic roof underlayment 
in early  we mutually agreed to move forward on a non exclusive basis 
we believe that this opens up our market opportunities for synthetic roof underlayment and house wrap 
infection control segment sales for the years ended december  was  compared to  for the same period of this increase of million or is primarily due to increased sales of our n niosh approved respirator mask due to concerns about avian flu 
our disposable protective apparel segment that services the pharmaceutical  cleanroom and industrial safety markets grew by for the year ended december  sales in the third and fourth quarter of were up as compared to the same period of we expect growth in as the comfortech line of products continues to take hold and as we bring on new distributors 
in september we announced the signing of a new distribution contract with our largest disposable protective apparel distributor 
under the terms of the multiple year contract that was effective january   they will retain the exclusive right to sell our private label critical cover products and we will now have the right to sell alpha pro tech branded products to other new distributors 
in we introduced a new line of disposable protective apparel products under the name of comfortech 
this has been a very successful produce launch and we have been encouraged by the success of this line of products 
we expect sales in this segment to increase in results of operations the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated sales gross profit selling  general and administrative income from operations income before provision for income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal sales consolidated sales for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december   representing an increase of  or 
we attribute the increase primarily to increased sales of construction supply weatherization products of  to increased sales of disposable protective apparel products of  and to increased infection control segment sales of  partially offset by decreased sales from our extended care unreal lambskin segment of sales for the disposable protective apparel segment for the year ended december  increased by  or to  compared to  for the same period of the increase was primarily due to increased sales of approximately million to our largest distributor  and an approximate million increase due to other distributors that concentrate on the cleanroom and industrial safety industries 
although disposable protective apparel sales increased by only a modest in  the second half of was strong 
sales for the fourth quarter of million were up from million in the fourth quarter of in addition  sales were up in the third and fourth quarter of as compared to the first and second quarters of and were up as compared to the third and fourth quarter of in we introduced a new line of products under the name of comfortech  a new material that we developed over the past two years 
in the latter half of we introduced a new category of the comfortech line  comfortech certified 
this is an entirely new class of products designed to decrease the risk of bioburden contamination in our target markets 
as well  in we will be bringing to market the comfortech sterile line of products 
we expect growth in as the comfortech line of products continues to gain market share and as we bring on new distributors 
we anticipate continued long term growth from the disposable protective apparel segment 
on september  we announced the signing of a new distribution contract with our largest distributor of disposable protective apparel 
under the terms of the multiple year contract that was effective january   they will retain the exclusive right to sell our private label critical cover products 
in addition  we will now have the right to sell alpha pro tech branded products to other new distributors 
this new contract further strengthens our relationship with our largest distributor and will enable us to gain additional market share as we develop relationships with new distributors 
infection control segment sales for the year ended december  increased by  or to  compared to  for the same period of the increase is primarily due to increased sales of our n niosh approved respirator mask due to concerns about avian flu 
we have significant manufacturing capacity for the n respirator mask in the event that demand surges  but unless the avian flu continues to be a worldwide concern  sales could soften in the engineered products segment consists of a line of construction supply weatherization products house wrap  synthetic roof underlayment as well as a line of paint with antimicrobials 
engineered products sales for the year ended december  increased by  or to  as compared to  for the same period of the breakdown of the engineered products sales is as follows for the year ended december  house wrap  synthetic roof underlayment 
this compares to house wrap  synthetic roof underlayment and antimicrobial paint for the year ended december  we expect the synthetic roof underlayment to continue to increase as a percentage of total engineered products sales 
synthetic roof underlayment sales for the year ended december  increased by as compared to the same period of this increase was facilitated in part by the fact that in october  we received notice of acceptance from the miami dade county building code compliance office for our synthetic roof underlayment alphaprotector sul which is recognized as possessing stringent criteria for building products 
also  in december  we announced that our synthetic roof underlayment had received the international code council icc es approval 
the icc governs the international building code ibc which oversees most building departments around the country 
these approvals significantly expand our synthetic roof underlayment opportunities as many construction supply companies require one or both of these certifications to sell our product 
in we entered into two agreements with perma r products  inc for house wrap and synthetic roof underlayment 
as part of these year mutually exclusive agreements  they agreed to purchase a minimum of million per year in house wrap and million in synthetic roof underlayment 
in they did not meet the annual minimums for either product 
in they purchased million of house wrap  meeting their contractual minimum requirement of million but did not meet the minimum for synthetic roof underlayment 
in early  we mutually agreed with them to move forward on a non exclusive basis 
we believe that this will broaden our market opportunities for synthetic roof underlayment and house wrap 
we are very encouraged by the response to our engineered products product line and we expect significant growth from this segment in as we will be introducing a line of synthetic roof underlayment and house wrap under the names rex synfelt and rex wrap 
sales from our extended care unreal lambskin and other related products  which includes a line of medical bed pads as well as pet beds  decreased by  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease of  in sales is primarily the result of lower medical bed pad sales

selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in the overall increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily related to increased employee compensation expenses of  increased marketing costs primarily related to engineered products of  and increased rent for engineered products of  we believe that we have built the infrastructure required to substantially grow our business and as our revenue grows our expenses are expected to continue to decrease as a percentage of sales 
the chief executive officer and president are each entitled to a bonus equal to of the pre tax profits of the company 
total bonuses of  were accrued for the year ended december  as compared to  in the same period of depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased by  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the same period in the decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction in depreciation for office equipment  computers and software  partially offset by increased depreciation for engineered products 
income from operations 
income from operations increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to income from operations of  for the year ended december  the increase in income from operations is due to an increase in gross profit of  and a decrease in depreciation and amortization of  partially offset by an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of  net interest

effective april  interest of is paid on this advance 
contractually  half of this  advance is to be repaid monthly over a six year term which commenced in july with the balance to be paid in the seventh year

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining whether the current year s financial statements are materially misstated 
sab permits registrants to record the cumulative effect of initial adoption by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings only if material under the dual method 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending on or after november  the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return

accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some entities  the application of this statement will change current practice 
sfas no 
is effective beginning january  we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 

sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many nancial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve nancial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
this statement is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement  which is consistent with the fasb s long term measurement objectives for accounting for nancial instruments
