part i item business our company align technology  inc was incorporated in april under the laws of the state of delaware 
we design  manufacture and market the invisalign system  a proprietary method for treating malocclusion  or the misalignment of teeth 
invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear  nearly invisible  removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position 
because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires  invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces 
invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens with mature dentition

industry background malocclusion malocclusion  the misalignment of teeth  is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions  affecting over million individuals  or approximately of the us population 
approximately two million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the us while most individuals seek orthodontic treatment to improve their appearance  malocclusion may also be responsible for dental problems such as tooth decay  tooth loss  gum disease  jaw joint pain and headaches 
because of the compromised aesthetics  discomfort and other drawbacks associated with conventional orthodontic treatments  only a relatively small proportion of people with malocclusion seek traditional treatment 
traditional orthodontic treatment in the us  dental professionals treat malocclusion primarily with metal archwires and brackets  commonly referred to as braces 
occasionally  dental professionals attempt to improve treatment aesthetics by using ceramic  tooth colored brackets or bond brackets on the inside  or lingual surfaces  of the patient s teeth 
dental professionals also augment braces with elastics  metal bands  headgear and other ancillary devices 
the average treatment takes approximately to months to complete and requires several hours of direct dental professional involvement  or chair time 
to initiate treatment  a dental professional will diagnose a patient s condition and create an appropriate treatment plan 
in a subsequent visit  the dental professional will bond brackets to the patient s teeth with cement and attach an archwire to the brackets 
thereafter  by tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks  the dental professional is able to exert sufficient force on the patient s teeth to achieve desired tooth movement 
because of the length of time between visits  the dental professional must tighten the braces to a degree sufficient to achieve sustained tooth movement during the interval 
in a final visit  the dental professional removes each bracket and residual cement from the patient s teeth 
upon completion of the treatment  the dental professional may  at his or her discretion  have the patient use a retainer 
fees for traditional orthodontic treatment typically range between us  to  with a median fee of approximately  generally only a portion of the fees is reimbursed by insurance  if covered at all 
in addition  dental professionals commonly charge a premium for lingual or ceramic alternatives 
fees are based on the difficulty of the particular case and on the dental professional s estimate of chair time  and are generally negotiated in advance 
a treatment that exceeds the dental professional s estimate of chair time generally results in decreased fees per hour of chair time  and reduced profitability for the dental professional 
limitations of traditional orthodontic treatment although braces are generally effective in correcting a wide range of malocclusions  they are subject to many limitations and disadvantages 
conventional orthodontic treatment is associated with unattractive appearance 
braces call attention to the patient s condition and treatment 
in addition  braces trap food  which can further compromise appearance 
braces can also result in permanent discoloration of teeth 
many adults associate braces with adolescence 
as a result of these and other limitations  less than one percent of american adults with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment annually 
oral discomfort 
braces are sharp and bulky and can abrade and irritate the interior surfaces of the mouth 
the tightening or adjustment of braces results in root and gum soreness and discomfort  especially in the few days immediately following an orthodontic visit 
poor oral hygiene 
braces compromise oral hygiene by making it more difficult to brush and floss 
these problems can result in tooth decay and periodontal damage 
additionally  the bonding of brackets to teeth can cause permanent markings on the teeth 
inability to project treatment 
historically  dental professionals have not had a means to model the movement of teeth over a course of treatment 
accordingly  dental professionals must rely on intuition and judgment to plan and project treatment 
as a result  they cannot be precise about the direction or distance of expected tooth movement between patient visits 
this lack of predictability may result in unwanted tooth movements and can limit the dental professional s ability to estimate the duration of treatment 
because most orthodontic treatment is performed on a fixed price basis  extended treatment duration reduces profitability for the dental professional 
physical demands on dental professional 
the manipulation of wires and brackets requires sustained manual dexterity and visual acuity  and may place other physical burdens on the dental professional 
root resorption 
the sustained high levels of force associated with conventional treatment can result in root resorption  which is a shortening of tooth roots 
this shortening can have substantial adverse periodontal consequences for the patient 
emergencies 
at times  braces need to be repaired or replaced on an emergency basis 
such emergencies cause significant inconvenience to both the patient and the dental professional 
due to the poor aesthetics  discomfort and other limitations of braces  relatively few people with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment 
accordingly  we believe there is a large unmet need for an orthodontic system that addresses these patient concerns 
we also believe there is an unmet need among dental professionals for a treatment system that increases the predictability and efficiency of treatment and enhances practice profitability 
the align solution invisalign which includes full invisalign treatment and invisalign express discussed below under our products is a proprietary system for treating malocclusion 
the invisalign treatment process is comprised of several phases  the principal steps of which are the creation of electronic treatment plans using clincheck and the manufacturing of invisalign aligners referred to in this form k as aligners 
the complete invisalign treatment process is described in greater detail under business the invisalign treatment process 
clincheck 
clincheck is an internally developed computer modeling program that allows dental professionals to diagnose and plan treatments for their patients 
we use a dental impression and a treatment form submitted by a dental professional to develop a customized  three dimensional treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of two week increments 
clincheck allows the dental professional to view this three dimensional simulation with a high degree of magnification and from any angle 
accordingly  clincheck enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible 
upon review of the clincheck simulation  the dental professional may immediately approve the projected treatment  or may provide us with feedback for modification 
we reflect any requested adjustments in a modified simulation 
upon the dental professional s approval of the clincheck simulation  we use the data underlying the simulation  in conjunction with stereolithography technology  to manufacture aligner molds 
international manufacturing solutions operaciones  srl  or ims  a third party shelter services provider in juarez  mexico  manufactures the molds and then uses these molds to fabricate the patient s aligners 
aligners 
aligners are custom manufactured  thin  clear plastic  removable dental appliances that are manufactured in a series to correspond to each two week stage of the clincheck simulation 
aligners are customized to perform the treatment prescribed for an individual patient by dental professionals using clincheck 
each aligner covers a patient s teeth and is nearly invisible when worn 
aligners are commonly worn in pairs  over the upper and lower dental arches 
aligners are generally worn for consecutive two week periods which correspond to the approved clincheck treatment simulation 
after two weeks of use  the patient replaces them with the next pair in the series 
this process is repeated until the final aligners are used and treatment is complete 
upon completion of the treatment  the dental professional may  at his or her discretion  have the patient use an invisalign retainer or go directly to a conventional retainer 
our products the vast majority of our revenue is generated from the sale of full invisalign treatment and invisalign express treatment 
full invisalign treatment 
commercial sales of full invisalign treatment commenced in the us in july our traditional  full invisalign treatment option is intended to be used as a complete treatment for a broad range of malocclusions 
each treatment plan is unique to the individual patient and will consist of as many aligners as indicated by clincheck in order to achieve the doctor s treatment goals 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenue was generated by the sale of full invisalign treatment 
invisalign express 
in the third quarter of  we launched invisalign express  a lower cost solution for less complex orthodontic cases 
invisalign express is a dual arch orthodontic treatment for cases that meet certain predetermined clinical criteria and consist of up to ten aligners 
invisalign express is intended to help a broader range of patients elect orthodontic treatment by providing a lower cost option for adult relapse cases  for minor crowding and spacing  and as a pre cursor to restorative or cosmetic treatments such as veneers 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenue was generated by the sale of invisalign express 
ancillary and other 
the remaining of our net revenue is generated by training fees and sales of ancillary products 
benefits of invisalign we believe that invisalign provides benefits to dental professionals and patients that have the potential to establish invisalign as the preferred alternative to conventional braces 
benefits to the dental professional ability to visualize treatment and likely outcomes 
clincheck enables dental professionals to preview a course of treatment and the likely outcome of treatment in an interactive three dimensional computer model 
clincheck allows dental professionals to analyze multiple treatment alternatives before selecting the course of action they feel is most appropriate for the patient 
begin using invisalign with minimal additional training 
the biomechanical principles that underlie treatment with the invisalign system are consistent with those of traditional orthodontics 
dental professionals can complete our initial training within two days 
we provide additional clinical support following the initial training and encourage dental professionals to attend continuing education classes  seminars and workshops 
expanded patient base 
we believe that invisalign has the potential to transform the practice of orthodontics 
currently  approximately two million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the us these patients represent approximately percent of the population of people with malocclusion 
of these  we estimate approximately percent  or approximately  patients have mature dentition with mild to moderate malocclusion and are therefore potential candidates for invisalign 
we believe that invisalign will allow dental professionals to attract patients who would not otherwise seek orthodontic treatment 
decreased dental professional and staff time 
invisalign eliminates the need for time intensive processes such as bonding appliances to the patient s teeth  adjusting archwires during the course of treatment and removing the appliances at the conclusion of treatment 
as such  use of invisalign reduces dental professional and staff chair time and can increase practice capacity 
practice productivity 
we believe that as dental professionals move to a higher volume of invisalign patients  they will be able to better leverage their existing resources  including office space and staff time  resulting in an increase in daily patient appointments and practice productivity 
benefits to the patient excellent aesthetics 
aligners are nearly invisible when worn  significantly reducing the aesthetic concerns associated with conventional braces 
comfort 
by replacing the six week adjustment cycle of traditional braces with two week stages  aligners move teeth more gently than conventional braces 
also  aligners are thin  smooth and low in profile 
as a result  aligners are more comfortable and less abrasive than conventional braces 
improved oral hygiene 
patients can remove aligners for tasks that are difficult with conventional braces  such as eating  brushing and flossing 
we believe this feature has the potential to reduce tooth decay and periodontal damage during treatment  which may result from conventional braces 
potentially reduced overall treatment time 
aligners control force by distributing it broadly over the exposed surfaces of the teeth 
in addition  the clincheck simulation from which aligners are produced is designed to reduce unintended and unnecessary tooth movements 
together  these factors may reduce overall treatment time relative to conventional braces 
potentially reduced root resorption 
we believe that controlling force and shortening treatment time has the potential to reduce the incidence of root resorption  which is the breakdown or destruction of root structure 
reduced incidence of emergencies 
typically  a lost or broken aligner is simply replaced with the next aligner in the treatment series  minimizing inconvenience to both patient and dental professional 
we believe that these benefits will prove attractive to people who currently do not seek treatment because of the limitations of conventional braces 
limitations of invisalign in some instances  the invisalign system may have certain limitations relative to conventional treatment 
aligners cost more to produce than conventional braces  and we charge dental professionals more than they generally pay for the supplies used in conventional treatment 
depending on the individual pricing policies of each dental professional  the cost of full invisalign treatment to the patient may be greater than for conventional braces 
dental professionals must also incorporate our manufacturing cycle times into their overall treatment plan 
once a dental professional submits a case to us  there is generally a turn around time of a month or more before the corresponding aligners are delivered 
aligners may not be appropriate for all cases  such as severe malocclusion  which may require aligners to be used in combination with conventional braces for optimal results 
in addition  because aligners are removable  treatment using invisalign depends on patients wearing their aligners as recommended 
some patients may experience a temporary period of adjustment to wearing aligners that may mildly affect speech 
in some instances  patients have experienced scratched or irritated gums  cheeks and lips and in some rare instances allergic reactions have occurred 
we believe that these limitations are generally outweighed by the many benefits of invisalign to both patients and dental professionals 
our target market and patient base we currently market invisalign to treat patients with mature dentition 
individuals with mature dentition have fully erupted second molars and substantially completed jaw growth  which typically occurs between the ages of and years 
we do not treat children whose teeth and jaws are still developing  as the effectiveness of invisalign relies on our ability to accurately predict the movement of teeth over the course of treatment 
based on our clinical studies to date  we recommend that dental professionals use invisalign as a complete treatment for a broad range of malocclusions and as a component of treatment for severe malocclusions 
we estimate percent of the people who annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the us  or more than  patients  have mature dentition and are therefore potential candidates for invisalign 
our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations 
we believe that  since invisalign addresses the primary limitations of braces  persons with malocclusion will be more likely to seek treatment 
we believe that adults  who are particularly sensitive to the aesthetic limitations of traditional treatment  represent our most immediate and significant market expansion opportunity 
in an effort to more fully penetrate our target market  in august  we launched invisalign express  a lower cost solution for less complex cases 
invisalign express is a simple  dual arch orthodontic treatment for cases that meet certain predetermined clinical criteria and consist of up to ten aligners 
we expect invisalign express will increase the overall market for invisalign  as patients who would not have otherwise sought orthodontic treatment due to its relatively high cost are introduced to this lower cost treatment option 
we continue to market and sell our traditional full invisalign treatment option for more complex cases 
as of december   approximately  patients worldwide have started treatment using invisalign 
internationally  we operate in the geographic regions of europe  asia pacific  japan and latin america 
in  international sales accounted for of our net revenues 
a geographic breakdown of our net revenues is summarized in note segments and geographic information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in each of fiscal  and  no single customer accounted for or more of our total net revenues 
business strategy our objective is to establish invisalign as the standard method for treating orthodontic malocclusion through customer responsiveness  product leadership and operational effectiveness 
key elements of our strategy include the following 
customer responsiveness focus on education and customer support 
in order to build long term relationships with our customers  we focus on delivering superior training  support and services 
each year  we provide numerous clinical education and training programs  which include certification classes  conference calls  seminars and workshops 
by participating in these events  we believe that our customers will emerge with a better understanding of the product and its applicability  and with a greater awareness for starting and finishing invisalign cases 
we also maintain an online clinical education center which is intended to augment our training workshops  conference calls and seminars by enabling invisalign trained doctors to obtain continuing education credits and access a full range of case studies and best practices 
as of december   we had trained approximately  dental professionals worldwide on the use and benefits of invisalign 
educate future orthodontists and general practitioners 
by educating dental students and orthodontic residents on the benefits of the invisalign technique  we believe they will be more likely to use this technology in their future practices and offer invisalign as a treatment option 
currently  we have incorporated the invisalign technique into the curriculum of university programs 
we expect additional dental schools to integrate the invisalign technique into their curricula in the future 
stimulate demand for invisalign treatment 
our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations  such as compromised aesthetics and oral discomfort 
by communicating the benefits of invisalign to both dental professionals and consumers  we intend to increase the number of patients who seek orthodontic treatment annually 
in  we expect to increase the overall marketing spending in the united states with a focus on programs designed to raise the profile of invisalign and drive more consumers to our most experienced doctors 
we also intend to initiate similar consumer marketing efforts  but on a smaller scale  in key european countries 
we believe that this increased consumer awareness of invisalign will increase the market for our products 
penetration into our domestic market 
we have two customer channels the orthodontist and the general practitioner dentist  or gp 
as specialists  orthodontists are a critical part of our business  and we expect that orthodontists will continue to treat the majority of complex cases and continue to drive research for expanding invisalign applications 
however  there exists a significantly greater number of gps in north america than orthodontists 
as the primary care dental provider  gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists  and possess a unique opportunity to educate these patients and introduce them to invisalign 
gps also have the ability to refer appropriate cases to orthodontists and  in certain instances  may choose to treat less complex cases themselves 
we are committed to improving the collaboration and referral relationships between orthodontists and gps 
we continue to support study clubs  which pair experienced orthodontists with less experienced gps 
these orthodontists act as mentors to the gps and lend them support and guidance in their invisalign practice 
through these study clubs  gps are introduced to an experienced invisalign practitioner and are able to refer appropriate cases to these orthodontists 
in  we expect that revenue generated by gps will represent an increasingly larger percentage of our revenue  largely due to the fact that there are significantly more gps than orthodontists 
we believe that by focusing on increasing utilization rates among our existing gp customers  the overall market for invisalign will increase  as patients that would not have otherwise sought orthodontic treatment are introduced to invisalign by their gps 
information regarding risks related to our expectation that orthodontists and gps will collaborate may be found in part i  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading risk factors 
product leadership new products and enhancements to products 
our strategy for ensuring product leadership focuses on delivering new products and product features as well as enhancing the user experience 
in we launched invisalign express  a lower cost solution for less complex cases  allowing the dental professional to treat a broader range of patients 
in the second half of  we began a phased rollout of clinadvisor  a new suite of software tools designed to make invisalign case selection and submission processes more efficient for doctors 
during  we expect to extend the product features and functionality of clinadvisor to an increasing number of practices 
in addition  we plan to introduce a further series of software enhancements that will evolve invisalign into distinct suites of software tools for the orthodontist and gp 
software enhancements for the orthodontist are intended to provide a more robust set of tools for greater predictability  wider applicability and more flexibility in the use of the invisalign system 
software enhancements targeting the gp will focus on ease of diagnosis  guidance through the case set up process and self help tools designed to simplify treatment of cases of mild to moderate malocclusion 
we continue to focus research and development efforts on next generation aligner material and a compliance indicator  which efforts we expect to extend at least through next generation aligner material is intended to consistently deliver force to the teeth over a longer period of time 
the compliance indicator is intended to help the dental professional and the patient understand if the patient has worn their aligner for enough time to effectively move their teeth 
we believe continuing to introduce new products and product features as well as enhancing the user experience will keep us at the forefront of the market and increase demand for invisalign 
extend and defend technology leadership 
invisalign represents a significant technological advancement in orthodontics 
our issued us patents broadly cover the invisalign system  including digital modeling and manipulation of scanned patient data  treatment planning  and fabrication of dental appliances  among others 
we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and non disclosure agreements 
we also seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws 
nonetheless  our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of various countries where the invisalign system is distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 
information regarding risks associated with failure to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in part i  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading risk factors 
see also part i  item of this annual report on form k under the heading legal proceedings 
operational effectiveness expand and enhance manufacturing capability 
our manufacturing operations are designed to produce large numbers of custom aligners at a high level of quality 
to improve cost efficiency  we conduct labor intensive processes in relatively low wage countries 
we believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet current requirements and that additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of operations 
our proprietary software underlies our manufacturing process 
by continually developing this software and other manufacturing processes  we plan to increase the level of production automation 
increased automation will enhance production capacity and reduce both unit costs and production times 
the invisalign treatment process the invisalign treatment process comprises the following five stages orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us 
in an initial patient visit  the dental professional determines whether invisalign is an appropriate treatment 
the dental professional then prepares a treatment data package which consists of a polyvinyl siloxane  or pvs  impression of the relevant dental arches  x rays of the patient s dentition  photographs of the patient  a bite impression depicting the relationship between the patient s upper and lower dental arches and an invisalign treatment planning form  or prescription 
the impression is a critical component of invisalign as it depicts the three dimensional geometry of the patient s teeth and hence forms the basis for our computer models 
an impression requires the patient to bite into a viscous material 
this material hardens  capturing the shape of the patient s teeth 
the prescription is also a critical component of invisalign  describing the desired positions and movement of the patient s teeth 
the dental professional sends the treatment data to our santa clara  california facility 
preparation of three dimensional computer models of the patient s initial malocclusion 
upon receipt  we use the treatment data to construct digital models of the patient s dentition 
using ct scanning  we scan the pvs impression to develop a digital  three dimensional computer model of the patient s current dentition 
we then transmit this initial computer model together with the dental professional s prescription and supplemental materials electronically to our facilities in costa rica 
preparation of computer simulated treatment and viewing of treatment using clincheck 
in costa rica we transform this initial digital model into a customized  three dimensional treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of two week increments 
this simulation is then reviewed for adherence to prescribed clinical  treatment and quality standards 
upon passing review  the simulation is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via virtual invisalign practice vip  our proprietary customer interfacing software  which is available on our websites located at www 
invisalign 
com and www 
aligntech 
com 
the dental professional then reviews the clincheck simulation and determines whether to ask us to make adjustments 
by reviewing and amending the treatment simulation  the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan and  thus  participates in the customized design of the aligners 
at this point  the dental professional may also invite the patient to review clincheck  allowing the patient to see the projected course of treatment 
the dental professional then approves the proposed treatment and  in doing so  engages us for the manufacture of corresponding aligners 
construction of molds corresponding to each step of treatment 
we use the approved clincheck simulation to construct a series of molds of the patient s teeth 
each mold is a replica of the patient s teeth at each two week stage of the simulated course of treatment 
these molds are fabricated by ims  a third party shelter services provider based in juarez  mexico 
manufacture of aligners and shipment to the dental professional 
from these molds  ims fabricates aligners by pressure forming polymeric sheets over each mold 
the aligners are then trimmed  polished  cleaned and packaged 
following final inspection  the aligners are shipped directly to the prescribing dental professional 
we ship all of the aligners in a single batch 
in certain cases  dental professionals may use invisalign in conjunction with tooth colored attachments bonded to the patient s teeth 
these attachments are used to increase the force applied to a tooth or teeth in circumstances where the aligners alone may have difficulty in effecting the desired movement 
in certain cases  we provide an aligner like template to the dental professionals to aid the placement of bonding attachments to the patient s teeth 
also  in cases where interproximal reduction  or ipr  is requested by the dental professional  we provide an ipr treatment form  quantifying the amount of space to be created through enamel reduction  location  and timing of ipr 
manufacturing to produce our highly customized  highly precise  medical quality products in volume  we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies 
these technologies include complex software solutions  computed tomography  known as ct scanning  stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication 
we rely on two vendors who are each the sole source of the polymer and resin used in our manufacturing process 
in the event that either of these vendors become unable for any reason to supply us with their respective products  we would experience a manufacturing disruption while we qualify and obtain an alternate source 
as of december   our manufacturing and operations staff in the us and costa rica consisted of people 
manufacturing is coordinated in santa clara  california 
digital dental modeling is processed in our  square foot facility in san jose  costa rica 
the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck treatments using simulation software 
in anticipation of increased capacity demands primarily resulting from the patients first program  we hired approximately new dental technicians in costa rica in the fourth quarter of for a more complete discussion of the patients first program  please see part i  item of this annual report on form k under the heading management s discussion and analysis overview 
in the second quarter of  in an effort to optimize operations  improve efficiency and reduce operating costs  we relocated our streolithography sla mold fabrication operations from our santa clara  california facility to ims  a third party shelter services provider based in juarez  mexico 
we also use ims for the fabrication and packaging of aligners 
information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found in part i  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading risk factors 
throughput management because we manufacture each case on a build to order basis  we must conservatively build manufacturing capacity for anticipated demand 
to increase throughput  we must improve the efficiency and increase the scale of our manufacturing processes 
in order to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes  we focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of rate limiting processes  or bottlenecks 
we continue to upgrade our proprietary  three dimensional treatment planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case  thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in costa rica 
during the first half of  as a result of the increase in demand for invisalign case volume primarily due to of the patients first program discussed in part i  item managements discussion and analysis overview  we will monitor our capacity in costa rica to ensure a sufficient number of technicians have been hired 
we are also continuing the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners manufactured in juarez  mexico 
in order to scale our manufacturing capacity  we expect that we will continue to invest in capital equipment 
quality assurance align s quality system is in compliance with food drug administration s medical device regulations  cfr part  and health canada s medical device regulations 
we are certified to en iso  internationally recognized standards for medical device manufacturing and of the council of canada 
align has a formal  documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined  understood and achieved 
systems  processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality 
we monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes  taking corrective action  as needed 
since we custom manufacture aligners on a build to order basis  we do not offer refunds on our products 
because each clincheck and each aligner is unique  we inspect of the product at various points in the manufacturing process  to ensure that the product meets our customers expectations 
aligners are subject to the invisalign product warranty  which covers defects in materials and workmanship 
our materials and workmanship warranty is in force until the invisalign case is completed 
in the event the aligners fall within the scope of the invisalign product warranty  we will replace the aligners at our expense 
our warranty is contingent upon proper use of the aligners for the purposes for which they are intended 
if a patient chooses not to wear the aligners  and as a result  requests additional invisalign treatment  the dental professional pays the additional expense of the replacement aligners 
the invisalign product warranty does not provide any assurances regarding the outcome of treatment using invisalign 
actual treatment results may deviate significantly from the approved clincheck treatment plan 
deviations not covered under warranty have typically been the result of unpredictable biological factors  such as variations in bone density or tooth topography and abnormal jaw growth 
warranty treatment requires that the dental professional submit new impressions of the patient s dentition to us 
we use the impressions to create a new clincheck treatment plan for the dental professional to approve  from which a successive series of aligners will be produced that will allow the patient to finish treatment 
sales and marketing we market invisalign by communicating invisalign s benefits directly to dental professionals through our training  certification programs and direct mail campaigns and to consumers with a nationwide advertising campaign 
based on our experience with advertising and commercial sales  we believe that making consumers aware of invisalign as a new treatment alternative generates significant demand for invisalign 
in order to serve anticipated demand  we are training a broad base of dental professionals 
professional marketing our sales and support staff has been engaged in marketing invisalign to orthodontists since july in  we began marketing invisalign to general practitioner dentists in our domestic market 
as of december  our north america sales organization consisted of people of which were direct sales representatives and were sales administration and management 
internationally  we have approximately people engaged in sales and sales support as december  we provide training  certification  marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and general practitioner dentists in the us and canada  which we consider our domestic market  and internationally 
as of december   we had trained approximately  dental professionals worldwide to use invisalign 
of those trained dental professionals  approximately are dental professionals in our domestic market united states and canada 
within our domestic market  we have trained approximately  orthodontists and approximately  active general practitioner dentists 
invisalign relies on the same orthodontic principles that apply to traditional treatment 
our sales and orthodontic teams conduct training primarily in a workshop format 
the key topics covered in training include invisalign applicability  instructions on filling out the invisalign treatment form  clinical tips and techniques  guidance on pricing and instructions on interacting with our clincheck software and the many other features of our website 
after training  sales representatives follow up with the dental professional to ensure that their staff is prepared to handle invisalign cases 
such follow up may include assisting the dental professional in taking dental impressions  establishing an internet connection and familiarizing them with our website 
sales representatives may also provide practice building assistance  including helping the dental professional to market invisalign to prospective patients through direct mail or other forms of media 
many dental professionals have commenced promotional activity in their local region with our assistance 
consumer marketing our experience indicates that prospective patients seek information from six primary sources an orthodontist  a general practice dentist  consumer marketing and advertising  our website  which can be accessed at either www 
invisalign 
com or www 
aligntech 
com  direct to consumer mail advertising and public relations efforts  and other invisalign patients 
in  we expect to increase the overall marketing spend in the united states with a focus on programs designed to raise the profile of invisalign and drive more consumers to our most experienced doctors 
we believe that this increased consumer awareness of invisalign will increase demand for our product 
research and development our research and development effort is focused on extending the range of dental applicability of invisalign  enhancing the software used in the manufacturing process and enhancing our invisalign system product lines 
our research and development expenses were million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal in an effort to demonstrate invisalign s broad treatment capabilities  various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases  including those of severe complexity 
we are also undertaking post marketing studies and making additional technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process 
we have recently started a phased roll out of clinadvisor  a new suite of software tools  designed to make invisalign case selection and submission processes more efficient and predictable for our doctors 
in addition  we plan to introduce a further series of software enhancements that will evolve invisalign into distinct suites of software tools for the orthodontist and gp 
software enhancements for the orthodontist are intended to provide a more robust set of tools for greater predictability  wider applicability and more flexibility in the use of the invisalign system 
software enhancements targeting the gp will focus on ease of diagnosis  guidance through the case set up process and self help tools designed to simplify treatment of cases of mild to moderate malocclusion 
we continue to focus research and development efforts on next generation aligner material and a compliance indicator  which efforts we expect to extend at least through intellectual property we believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage 
as of december   we had issued us patents  pending us patent applications  and numerous foreign issued patents  as well as pending foreign patent applications 
see part i  item legal proceedings for a discussion on reexamination proceedings pending with the united states patent and trademark office 
we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and non disclosure agreements 
we also seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws 
we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products 
our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of various foreign countries where invisalign is distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 
our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business

competition we compete for the attention of dental professionals with manufacturers of traditional orthodontic appliances or wires and brackets  which include m company  sybron dental specialties and dentsply international  inc we also compete directly with established companies that manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use to invisalign  including the product called red  white blue manufactured and distributed by ormco orthodontics  a division of sybron dental specialties 
in may  danaher corporation purchased sybron dental specialties 
see part i  item legal proceedings for a summary of our litigation with ormco 
in may  orthoclear  inc announced the commercial launch of the orthoclear system  a product that was intended to compete directly with our invisalign system 
on october   we entered into a formal agreement with orthoclear  inc  orthoclear holdings  inc  and orthoclear pakistan pvt 
ltd 
orthoclear  together with certain individuals associated with orthoclear to end all pending litigation between the parties 
in addition  orthoclear agreed  among other things  to stop accepting new patient cases for treatment  consent to the entry of an exclusion order by the itc prohibiting the importation of orthoclear aligners into the united states  assign and transfer to align all intellectual property rights with application to the correction of malocclusion and to discontinue all design  manufacture  marketing and sales of removable dental aligners worldwide 
see part i  item legal proceedings for a summary of our litigation with orthoclear 
in the future  we may face further competition from other early stage and more mature companies who enter our target markets to manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use to invisalign 
information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in part i  item ia of this annual report on form k under the heading risk factors 
we believe that in addition to price  the principal competitive factors in the market for orthodontic appliances include the following aesthetic appeal of the treatment method  effectiveness of treatment  customer support  comfort associated with the treatment method  oral hygiene  ease of use  and dental professionals chair time 
we believe that invisalign compares favorably with our competitors products with respect to each of these factors 
government regulation fda s quality system regulation for medical devices 
in  we were informed by the food and drug administration  or fda  that our invisalign system had been reclassified as a class ii medical device 
the invisalign system was previously regulated as a class i medical device and was exempted from requiring k pre market notification prior to commercialization 
in  however  we had voluntarily filed with and subsequently received pre market clearance from the fda pursuant to the k pre market notification procedure  allowing us to market the product in the us therefore  we currently possess the necessary k clearance from the fda to continue to market our product under the class ii classification 
prior to the reclassification  our product development  manufacturing processes  packaging  labeling  handling  storage and distribution activities were subject to extensive oversight by the fda 
we believe our invisalign system is in compliance in all material respects with applicable quality system regulations  record keeping and reporting requirements in the production and distribution of the invisalign system 
we do not anticipate any significant difficulty or material cost increases in complying with applicable performance standards as a result of the incremental regulatory requirements resulting from the class ii reclassification 
our aligners are manufactured by ims  a third party shelter services provider based in juarez  mexico 
ims is registered with the fda as a medical device manufacturer and is certified to iso requirements 
we have also ensured that our quality system procedures and processes have been implemented at ims to comply with the fda s quality systems standards 
ims has dedicated an area in its facilities and trained personnel in the manufacture and distribution of invisalign 
we and ims are subject to routine inspections by the fda and state agencies to determine compliance with quality system requirements 
we are registered with the state of california as a medical device manufacturer 
if the fda determines that we or ims failed to comply with the applicable fda regulations  it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions against us  ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions  including but not limited to financial penalties  withdrawal of our right to market our products and criminal prosecution 
health canada s medical device regulations 
in canada  we are required to comply with health canada s medical device regulations 
our products are registered with health canada 
we believe we are in compliance with their regulations and have been granted clearance to market our products in canada 
european union s mdd requirements iso in europe  invisalign is regulated as a custom device and as such  we follow the requirements of the medical device directives 
we are iso certified  which facilitates commercialization of invisalign outside the united states and especially in europe 
health insurance portability and accountability act of under the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  congress mandated a package of interlocking administrative simplification rules to establish standards and requirements for electronic transmission of certain health information 
confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which these records may be released are subject to substantial regulations under the hipaa standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information  referred to as the privacy standard  and other state laws and regulations 
the privacy standard governs both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information 
although compliance is principally the responsibility of the hospital  physician or other healthcare provider  we are required to maintain the confidentiality of patient information when providing technical services and when handling patient information and records 
we have designed our product and service offerings to be consistent with the requirements of the privacy and security standards under hipaa and applicable corresponding state laws and regulations 
maintaining systems that are consistent with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our patients 
additionally  our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare participants in dealing with hipaa requirements 
other federal and state laws 
as a participant in the health care industry we are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulation under many other laws administered by governmental entities at the federal  state and local levels  some of which are  and others of which may be  applicable to our business 
furthermore  our health care service provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us 
laws regulating medical device manufacturers and health care providers cover a broad array of subjects 
for example  the confidentiality of patient medical information and the circumstances under which such information may be used by us  released for inclusion in our databases  or released by us to third parties  are subject to substantial regulation by state governments 
these state laws and regulations govern both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information and are evolving rapidly 
in addition  provisions under the federal anti kickback statute prohibit  among other things  paying or offering to pay any remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients to a person participating in  or for the order  purchase or recommendation of items or services that are subject to reimbursement by  medicare  medicaid and other similar federal or state health care programs 
most states have also enacted illegal remuneration laws that are similar to the federal laws 
these laws are applicable to our financial relationships with  and any marketing or other promotional activities involving  our dental professional customers 
finally  various states regulate the operation of an advertising and referral service for dentists  and may require registration of such services with a state agency as well as compliance with various requirements and restrictions on how they conduct business and structure their relationships with participating dentists 
violations of any of these laws or regulations could subject us to a variety of civil and criminal sanctions

risk factors if we fail to grow our revenue while controlling our expenses  the market price of our common stock may decline 
you should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by a company in an early stage of operations 
consistent with a company in an early stage of operations  we continue to incur significant operating expenses to develop new software and increase the automation of our manufacturing processes  execute our consumer marketing campaign and dental professional marketing efforts  increase the capacity of our business enterprise systems and manufacturing operations  execute clinical research and education plans  develop technological improvements to our products and new product development  continue our international sales and marketing efforts  protect our intellectual property  including trade secrets  and undertake quality assurance and improvement initiatives 
for instance  in an effort to raise the profile of invisalign and match prospective patients with our most experienced dental professionals  we have in the past utilized consumer marketing campaigns involving television  radio and print media 
marketing programs of this nature are expensive and may have limited success  if any  and may not result in revenue generation commensurate with their costs 
in addition  in an attempt to help minimize treatment disruptions for former orthoclear patients and their doctors  we committed to make invisalign treatment available to existing orthoclear patients at no charge from align through our patients first program 
as a result  we will receive no revenue for any additional cases we start under this program while incurring significant expenses as well as increased demands on our sales and customer service representatives and on our manufacturing processes 
we currently anticipate that we will be able to complete the patients first program by the end of the second quarter of fiscal our success will depend in part on our ability to effectively integrate the orthoclear patients into our infrastructure with minimal impact on our existing and new doctors 
in implementing this program  we experienced higher than anticipated demand from the patients first program as well as regular new patients 
as a result  many of our customers experienced longer customer service hold times and slight delays in clincheck processing times during the fourth quarter of which we anticipate will continue during the first and second quarters of although we believe these delays are temporary in nature  these difficulties could cause us to lose existing customers  face potential customer disputes or limit the number of new customers who purchase our products or services 
this could cause a decline in our revenues  gross margins and net profits  and could adversely affect our operating results 
see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
while we achieved profitability beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal and through the second quarter of fiscal  we experienced a net loss in the third quarter of as well as each quarter of if we are to achieve profitability in future periods  we will need to continue to increase our revenues  while controlling our expenses 
while we generated positive operating cash flow for the first time in fiscal year and continued to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal years and  we experienced negative cash flow in we cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve positive cash flow from operations  from period to period  in the future 
because our business is evolving  it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth  and we have in the past not been and may in the future not be able to sustain our historical growth rates 
if we do not increase profitability or revenue growth or otherwise meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock will likely decline 
we have a limited operating history and expect our future financial results to fluctuate which may cause volatility in our stock price 
we were incorporated in april and began sales of invisalign in july thus  we have a limited operating history  which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects 
in addition  we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we focus on increasing our commercial sales 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include changes in the timing of receipt of case product orders during a given quarter  changes in product mix due to the introduction of invisalign express  a lower cost alternative for treating less complex cases  unanticipated delays in production caused by insufficient capacity  any disruptions in the manufacturing process  including as a result of unexpected turnover in the labor force or the introduction of new production processes or as a result of natural or other disasters beyond our control  the development and marketing of directly competitive products by existing and new competitors  aggressive price competition from competitors  costs and expenditures in connection with ongoing litigation  inaccurate forecasting of revenues  production and other operating costs  and investments in research and development to develop new products and enhancements to invisalign 
to respond to these and other factors  we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy  business structure or operations 
for instance  although we entered into a definitive agreement in october with orthoclear whereby  among other things  orthoclear agreed to discontinue all design  manufacture  marketing and sales of removable dental aligners worldwide  we experienced increased pricing pressure in and as a result of the commercial launch of orthoclear s product 
partly in response to this increased competition  in the fourth quarter of  we changed our pricing structure and reduced our list price for full invisalign treatment to  and expanded our volume based discount program to all doctors 
these programs were in effect in  and had an adverse impact on our revenues  gross margins and net profit loss 
most of our expenses  such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations  are relatively fixed in the short term 
moreover  our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future revenue levels 
as a result  if our revenues for a particular period fall below our expectations  we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in revenues 
therefore  our operating results for a given period may be adversely affected 
due to these and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 
we depend on the sale of invisalign for the vast majority of our revenues  and any decline in sales of invisalign or average selling prices would adversely affect revenue  gross margin and net profits 
we expect that revenues from the sale of invisalign will continue to account for the vast majority of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
continued and widespread market acceptance of invisalign by orthodontists  gps and consumers is critical to our future success 
if orthodontists and gps experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services  if consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate  if orthodontists and gps do not collaborate as we expect  if orthodontists or gps choose to use a competitive product rather than invisalign or if the average selling price of our product declines as it has in the past  our operating results would be harmed 
factors that could cause invisalign not to achieve market acceptance at the rate at which we expect  as well as the risk related to declining average selling prices are described more fully below 
dental professionals may not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate 
our success depends upon increasing acceptance and frequency of use of the invisalign system by dental professionals 
invisalign requires orthodontists  gps and their staff to undergo special training and learn to interact with patients in new ways 
in addition  because invisalign has only been in clinical testing since july and commercially available only since july  orthodontists and gps may be reluctant to adopt it until more historical clinical results are available 
also  increasing adoption and cumulative use by orthodontists and gps will depend on factors such as the capability  safety  efficacy  ease of use  price  quality and reliability of our products  our ability to provide effective sales support  training and service and the availability of competing products  technologies and alternative treatments 
in addition  unanticipated poor clinical performance of invisalign could result in significant adverse publicity and  consequently  reduced acceptance by dental professionals 
also increased competition from direct competitors could cause us to lose market share and reduce dental professionals efforts and commitment to expand their invisalign practice 
if invisalign does not achieve growing acceptance in the orthodontic and gp communities  our operating results will be harmed 
consumers may not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate 
our success depends upon the acceptance of invisalign by a substantially larger number of dental professionals as well as potential consumers to whom we are now actively marketing 
invisalign represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment  and consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to conventional treatment 
in addition  consumers may not comply with recommended treatment guidelines for invisalign  which could compromise the effectiveness of their treatment 
we have generally received positive feedback from both orthodontists  gps and consumers regarding invisalign as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for treatment of malocclusion  but a number of dental professionals believe that invisalign is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients 
market acceptance will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals  as well as other factors including effectiveness  safety  reliability  improved treatment  aesthetics  greater comfort and hygiene compared to conventional orthodontic products and price for invisalign compared to competing products 
furthermore  consumers may not respond to our direct marketing campaigns or we may be unsuccessful in reaching our target audience 
adoption by consumers may also be affected by general macroeconomic conditions in north america and internationally  which fluctuate and could be affected by unstable global economic  political or other conditions 
the orthodontists and gps may choose not to collaborate and referrals between orthodontists and gps may not increase at the rate that we anticipate or at all 
our success depends in part upon improving the collaboration and referral relationships between orthodontists and gp dentists 
as specialists  orthodontists are a critical part of our business  and we expect that orthodontists will continue to treat the majority of complex cases and continue to drive research for expanding invisalign applications 
we expect  however  that the percentage of revenues generated by gps will increase  largely due to the fact that there are significantly more gps than orthodontists 
as the primary provider of dental care  gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists  possess a unique opportunity to educate these patients and introduce them to invisalign  have the ability to refer appropriate cases to orthodontists and  in certain instances  may chose to treat less complex cases themselves 
if this collaboration and increase in referrals does not occur or occurs more slowly than we anticipate  our operating results could be harmed 
declines in average selling prices of our products 
in response to challenges in our business  including increased competition  in november  we reduced the list price of full invisalign cases and in the third quarter of we introduced invisalign express  a lower cost solution for less complex cases 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we expanded our volume based discount program to all doctors 
as a result of these programs  the blended average selling price for our products declined in compared to and may further decline in as a result of greater participation in our volume discount program 
additionally in europe  we introduced new pricing initiatives in the first quarter of which resulted in a lower average selling price in if we are required to introduce any similar programs in the future  our revenue  gross margin and net profits losses may be adversely affected 
we are dependent on our international manufacturing operations  which exposes us to foreign operational  political and other risks that may harm our business 
currently  two of our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica  technicians use a sophisticated  internally developed computer modeling program to prepare electronic treatment plans  which are transmitted electronically back to the us these electronic files form the basis of clincheck and are used to manufacture aligner molds 
in the first quarter of  we completed the process of relocating our sla mold fabrication operations from our santa clara  california facility to our third party shelter services provider  ims  located in juarez  mexico 
ims also fabricates the aligners and ships the completed products to our customers 
as a result of this relocation  our reliance on our international manufacturing operations will continue to increase 
our increasing reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation  including difficulties in hiring and retaining employees generally  as well as difficulties in hiring and retaining employees with the necessary skills to perform the more technical aspects of our operations  as well as staffing in numbers sufficient to implement the patients first program  difficulties in managing international operations  including our relationship with ims  our third party shelter services provider  import and export license requirements and restrictions  controlling production volume and quality of the manufacturing process  political  social and economic instability  acts of terrorism and acts of war  interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services  product or material transportation delays or disruption  burdens of complying with a wide variety of local country and regional laws  trade restrictions and changes in tariffs  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and potential adverse tax consequences 
if any of these risks materialize in the future  we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue 
a key step in our manufacturing process relies on sophisticated computer technology that requires new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process 
if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth  and fail to hire sufficient number of technicians in advance of such demand  the delivery time of our product could be delayed which could adversely affect our results of operations 
training technicians to use our sophisticated computer modeling program that produces the electronic treatment forms that form the basis of clincheck takes approximately to days 
as a result  if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth  we may not have a sufficient number of trained technicians to timely create clincheck treatment forms within the timeframe our customers expect 
any delay in clincheck processing time could delay the ultimate delivery of finished aligners to our customers 
such a delay could cause us to lose existing customers or limit the number of new customers who purchase our products 
this could cause a decline in our revenue and net profits and could adversely affect our results of operations 
our headquarters  clincheck setup and other manufacturing processes are all principally located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 
our digital dental modeling is processed in our facility located in san jose  costa rica 
the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck treatment plans using sophisticated computer software 
in addition  our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated by ims  our third party shelter services provider located in juarez  mexico 
both costa rica and mexico are earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters 
if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located  our ability to create clincheck treatment plans or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing a significant delay in receiving their completed aligners 
in addition  our headquarters facility is located in the san francisco bay area 
a earthquake or other natural disaster in this region could result in a disruption in our operations 
any such business interruption could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we currently rely on third parties to provide key inputs to our manufacturing process  and if our access to these inputs is diminished  our business may be harmed 
we currently outsource key portions of our manufacturing process 
we rely on ims  a third party shelter services provider located in juarez  mexico  to fabricate aligner molds as well as finished aligners and to ship the completed product to customers 
if ims fails to deliver its components or if we lose its services  we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner  and our business may be harmed 
any difficulties encountered by ims with respect to hiring and retaining qualified personnel  and maintaining acceptable manufacturing standards  controls  procedures and policies could disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner 
finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive  time consuming or impossible 
we experience competition from manufacturers of traditional braces and expect aggressive competition from these and other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future 
currently  our invisalign product competes directly against a product called red  white and blue  which is manufactured and distributed by ormco orthodontics  a division of sybron dental specialties 
in may  danaher corporation purchased sybron dental specialties 
prior to orthoclear agreeing  pursuant to the terms of an agreement entered into in october  to discontinue all design  manufacture  marketing and sales of removable dental aligners worldwide  our invisalign system competed directly with an aligner product manufactured by them 
in addition  manufacturers of traditional braces  such as m company  sybron dental specialties and dentsply international have substantially greater financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do and may  in the future  attempt to develop an orthodontic system similar to ours 
large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market 
furthermore  we may face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies 
we may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive 
if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by new or existing competitors  our business could be harmed 
increased competition from orthoclear and other competitors recently resulted in and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions  reduced gross margins  reduced profitability and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue  volume growth  net profit and stock price 
for instance  in the fourth quarter of  in order to encourage continued use of our products  we extended our volume based discount program to all of our doctors 
in addition  in the second half of  we introduced invisalign express  a lower cost solution for less complex cases as well as a new pricing initiative which had the effect of reducing our average selling price per case 
these programs have adversely affected our revenues  gross margin and net profit 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our information technology systems are critical to our business 
system integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations  which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 
we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems 
all information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources 
as our business has grown in size and complexity  the growth has placed  and will continue to place  significant demands on our information technology systems 
to effectively manage this growth  we will need to continually upgrade and enhance our information systems 
in addition  experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties  create system disruptions or cause shutdowns 
furthermore  sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture  including bugs and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system 
the costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems  viruses and bugs could be significant  and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations  revenues and operating results 
in addition  our data center operations are located in our headquarters in santa clara  california 
we are in the process of moving our data center operations and changing our data center infrastructure 
we expect the move to be completed over the next two years 
we may experience technical difficulties in connection with these changes 
if we experience a system failure or disruption for any reason  including in connection with changes in our data center location or infrastructure  the performance of our website would be harmed and our service could shut down 
throughout we focused on adding additional functionality into our business enterprise systems and intend to continue this effort for the foreseeable future  which will more efficiently integrate these systems with our other system applications  such as customer facing and manufacturing tools 
system upgrades and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources 
delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 
furthermore  we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications  specifically clincheck and vip 
software applications frequently contain errors or defects  especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released 
the discovery of a defect or error in a new upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result in the following consequences  among others loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance  damage to our reputation or increased service costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our success depends in part on our proprietary technology  and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position may be harmed 
litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price 
our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products  both in the us and in other countries 
our inability to do so could harm our competitive position 
as of december   we had issued us patents  pending us patent applications  and numerous foreign issued patents  as well as pending foreign patent applications 
we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position 
however  our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents 
additionally  any patents issued to us may be challenged  invalidated  held unenforceable  circumvented  or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products 
during fiscal and  requests were filed with the united states patent and trademark office uspto by a san francisco  california law firm  acting on behalf of an unnamed party and in some instances acting on behalf of orthoclear  requesting re examination of a number of our patents 
see part i item of this annual report on form k for a summary of the uspto proceedings 
in addition  any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under us patents and intellectual property laws 
we also rely on protection of our copyrights  trade secrets  know how and proprietary information 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us 
however  these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information  and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur 
see part i item of this annual report on form k for a summary of the orthoclear litigation 
our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents  copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and future growth prospects 
in particular  a failure of our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology  which could adversely affect our pricing and market share 
in addition  in an effort to protect our intellectual property we have in the past been and may in the future be involved in litigation 
for example  in october  we entered into an agreement with orthoclear whereby orthoclear and align agreed  among other things  to dismiss all pending lawsuits against each other  including the patent infringement action against orthoclear filed in the western district of wisconsin madison 
in addition  we are currently involved in a patent infringement lawsuit with ormco 
the potential effects on our business operations resulting from similar litigation that we may participate in the future  whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us  are costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations 
any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 
in addition  we are currently a party to various other legal proceedings and claims 
management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these other legal proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in addition  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur 
an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or  in cases where injunctive relief is sought  an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products 
any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 
see part i item of this annual report on form k for a summary of our material pending legal proceedings 
while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting  we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 
pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec  we are required to furnish in our form k an annual report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
the report includes  among other things  an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
while we currently believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective  the effectiveness of our internal controls to future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  and  as a result  the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which would have an adverse effect on our stock price 
our future success may depend on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products 
our future success may depend on our ability to develop  obtain regulatory approval or clearance of  manufacture and market new products 
in the second half of  we launched invisalign express a lower cost aligner system used for less complex cases 
we recently announced a phased rollout of clinadvisor  a new suite of software tools designed to make invisalign case selection and submission processes more efficient for doctors 
in addition  we plan to introduce a further series of software enhancements that will evolve invisalign into distinct suites of software tools for the orthodontist and gp 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop  sell and achieve market acceptance of these and other new products and applications and enhanced versions of our existing product 
the extent of  and rate at which  market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables  which include  among other things  price  safety  efficacy  reliability  marketing and sales efforts  the availability of third party reimbursement of procedures using our new products  the existence of competing products and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns 
our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation  including approval or clearance by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  and foreign government agencies 
any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products or enhanced versions of existing products and achieve market acceptance of new products and new applications could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our revenues to decline 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel  we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products 
we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering  technology development  sales and marketing personnel and management teams 
the loss of the services of those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business 
our future success will also depend on our ability to identify  recruit  train and retain additional qualified personnel  including orthodontists 
few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices  universities and other research institutions 
thus  we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business 
furthermore  we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  our business could be materially harmed 
if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim  our ability to grow our business will be severely limited 
extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry 
we have been sued for infringement of third party s patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future 
from time to time  we have received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights 
while we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention  there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits  interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities 
an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties 
licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all  in which event  our business would be materially adversely affected 
we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies  and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends 
we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment  rapid prototyping machines  resin and other advanced materials 
we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies 
in particular  we are committed to purchase all of our resin from a single source and our scanning and stereolithography equipment are provided by single suppliers 
technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive  time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes 
our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth 
in the event of technology changes  delivery delays or shortages of these items  our business and growth prospects may be harmed 
we have experienced rapid growth  and our failure to manage this growth could harm our business 
we have expanded rapidly since we commenced commercial sales in our headcount increased from approximately employees as of december  to  employees as of december  this expansion will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources and will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational  financial and other internal controls  both in the us and internationally 
in particular  growth increases the challenges involved in a number of areas  including recruiting and retaining sufficiently skilled personnel  providing adequate training and supervision to maintain our high quality standards  and preserving our culture and values 
our inability to effectively manage growth could harm our business 
we rely on our direct sales force to sell our products  and any failure to maintain our direct sales force could harm our business 
our ability to sell our products and generate revenues depends upon our direct sales force within our domestic and international markets 
as of december  our north america sales organization consisted of people of which were direct sales representatives and were sales administration and management 
internationally  we have approximately people engaged in sales and sales support as december  we do not have any long term employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force 
the loss of the services of these key personnel may harm our business 
if we are unable retain our direct sales force personnel or replace them with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications  or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise or if we fail to reestablish strong relationships with our customers within a relatively short period of time  our revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed 
complying with regulations enforced by the food and drug administration fda and other regulatory authorities is an expensive and time consuming process  and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 
our products are medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the us and internationally 
fda regulations are wide ranging and govern  among other things product design  development  manufacture and testing  product labeling  product storage  pre market clearance or approval  advertising and promotion  and product sales and distribution 
our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the fda or state agencies  which may include any of the following sanctions warning letters  fines  injunctions  consent decrees and civil penalties  repair  replacement  refunds  recall or seizure of our products  operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production  refusing our requests for k clearance or pre market approval of new products  new intended uses  or modifications to existing products  withdrawing clearance or pre market approvals that have already been granted  and criminal prosecution 
if any of these events were to occur  they could harm our business 
we must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations 
the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections 
we and ims  our third party shelter services provider have not yet been subject to an fda inspection  and we cannot assure you we or ims will successfully pass such an inspection in the future 
our failure or the failure of ims to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or the failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action  and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers  which could be a long and costly process 
before we can sell a new medical device in the us  or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain fda clearance or approval  unless an exemption applies 
obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be a lengthy and time consuming process 
even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the fda  we may be unable to maintain such clearances in the future 
furthermore  we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that we intend to market in the future 
our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business 
if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised  patient care could suffer  and we could be liable for related damages  and our reputation could be impaired 
we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers 
therefore  it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure 
despite the implementation of security measures  our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses  programming errors  attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems 
if we fail to meet our clients expectations regarding the security of healthcare information  we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be impaired 
in addition  patient care could suffer  and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner 
our insurance may not protect us from this risk 
if compliance with healthcare regulations becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us  we may not be able to grow our business 
participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal  state and local levels  some of which are  and others of which may be  applicable to our business 
furthermore  our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us 
the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences 
regulations implemented pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa  including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services  result in delays or cancellations of orders  or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants 
the effect of hipaa and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict  and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 
extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties 
in addition to medical device laws and regulations  numerous state and federal healthcare related laws regulate our business  covering areas such as storage  transmission and disclosure of medical information and healthcare records  prohibitions against the offer  payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals to entities providing healthcare services or goods or to induce the order  purchase or recommendation of our products  and the marketing and advertising of our products 
complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and time consuming  and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues 
we face risks related to our international sales  including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals 
we currently sell our products in europe  canada  mexico  brazil  australia  hong kong and japan and may expand into other countries from time to time 
we do not know whether orthodontists  gps and consumers outside our domestic market will adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate 
in addition  sales of our products outside the us are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
the time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for fda clearance or approval  and requirements for such approvals may differ from fda requirements 
we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future 
we may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals 
if we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the us  or if we fail to receive these approvals  we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner  if at all 
our business exposes us to potential product liability claims  and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation 
medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity 
we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable 
although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance  adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
a product liability claim  regardless of its merit or eventual outcome  could result in significant legal defense costs 
these costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management s attention away from the operation of our business  and could harm our business 
in fiscal and during the first two months of fiscal  the market price for our common stock was volatile 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the factors include quarterly variations in our results of operations and liquidity  changes in recommendations by the investment community or in their estimates of our revenues or operating results  speculation in the press or investment community concerning our business and results of operations  strategic actions by our competitors  such as product announcements or acquisitions  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our customers or competitors  and general market conditions 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  class action litigation has often been brought against the issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities 
if a securities class action suit is filed against us in the future  we would incur substantial legal fees  and our management s attention and resources would be diverted from operating our business in order to respond to the litigation 
future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price 
a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders 
these stockholders have sold in the past  and may sell in the future  large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price 
changes in  or interpretations of  accounting rules and regulations  could result in unfavorable accounting charges 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions 
our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows revenue recognition  accounting for share based payments  and accounting for income taxes 
in particular  the fasb recently enacted sfas no 
revised  share based payment fas r which we adopted effective in the first quarter of fiscal see note shareholders equity of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the impact of fas r on our reported financial results 
we have made use of a shareholders rights plan to limit the possibility that we are acquired  which may mean that a transaction that shareholders are in favor of or are benefited by may be prevented 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders 
to date  our board of directors has designated  shares as series a participating preferred stock in connection with our shareholder rights plan 
the issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of the company or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of the holders of our stock 
the shareholder rights plan may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of our company which is deemed undesirable by our board of directors 
the shareholder rights plan may cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting to acquire us on terms or in a manner not approved by our board of directors  except pursuant to an offer conditioned on the negation  purchase or redemption of the rights issued under the shareholder rights plan

see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview for discussion of the patients first program 
in accordance with the terms of the orthoclear agreement  on october   we made a one time cash payment of million to orthoclear holdings  inc ormco on january   ormco corporation ormco filed suit against us in the united states district court for the central district  orange county division  asserting infringement of us patent nos 
  and  ormco is a division of sybron dental specialties 
in may  danaher corporation acquired sybron dental specialties 
the complaint sought unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief 
on february   we answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims seeking a declaration by the court of invalidity and non infringement of the asserted patents 
in addition  we counterclaimed for infringement of our us patent no 
 seeking unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief 
ormco filed a reply to our counterclaims on march  and asserted counterclaims against us seeking a declaration by the court of invalidity and non infringement of us patent no 
 we amended our counterclaim to add allesee orthodontic appliances  inc aoa  a wholly owned subsidiary of ormco  as a counterdefendant in regard to our counterclaim of infringement of us patent no 
 the court then permitted ormco to amend its complaint and permitted us to amend our counterclaim to add an additional patent each 
ormco filed a first amended complaint for infringement of us patent no 
 on october  on october   we filed an answer to ormco s first amended complaint and a counterclaim for invalidity and non infringement of us patent no 
 and for infringement of us patent no 
 in connection with these claims  the court granted five motions for summary judgment that we filed 
first  on may   the court granted our motion for summary judgment of non infringement  finding that our invisalign system does not infringe any of the asserted ormco patents    and 
second  on july   the court granted in part our motion for summary judgment of infringement  finding that ormco and aoa infringe certain  but not all  claims of our patents nos 
 and  through the manufacture and sale of red  white blue appliances 
third  on august   the court granted our motion for summary judgment of invalidity of ormco s asserted patents claims    and 
as noted above  the court earlier found that we do not infringe these patents 
in addition  the court also denied ormco s and aoa s motion for summary judgment seeking a finding of invalidity of our asserted patent claims  and 
fourth  the court granted our summary judgment motion that our asserted patent claims are not invalid based on the evidence currently before the court 
although the court granted that motion  it reopened discovery on two additional invalidity arguments ormco and aoa asserted 
fifth  the court also granted our summary judgment motion that our patents are not unenforceable and granted ormco s and aoa s summary judgment motion that ormco and aoa did not willfully infringe our patents 
on december   we filed a further summary judgment motion that our asserted claims are not invalid based on ormco s and aoa s new evidence 
ormco and aoa filed a counter summary judgment motion that our asserted claims are invalid based on this new evidence 
the motions were heard by the court on february  on february   the court granted our motion in part  confirming the validity of all of the asserted claims of our  patent and two of the asserted claims of our  patent 
the court also granted ormco s and aoa s motion in part  finding certain claims of our  patent to be invalid in view of prior use evidence 
on march   ormco and aoa moved for reconsideration of the court s ruling that claims and of our us patent no 
 are not invalid 
on april   the court ruled that it would adhere to its previous ruling that claims and of our  patent are not invalid 
on march   we filed a motion for permanent injunction to prevent ormco and aoa from selling the infringing red  white blue system 
on may   the court issued a permanent injunction the permanent injunction to enjoin ormco and aoa from further infringement of claims and of our  patent and claims and of our  patent 
on may   ormco and aoa noticed an appeal to the federal circuit from the permanent injunction 
on february   we entered into a settlement agreement the settlement agreement with ormco and aoa 
in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement  ormco and aoa paid into escrow  pending the completion of the appellate process   to resolve the issues of past damages  willfulness and attorneys fees for the adjudged infringement of align s us patent nos 
 and  the align patents through the manufacture and sale of ormco s and aoa s red  white blue appliances 
our receipt of the payments out of escrow is contingent upon the court  in a final  non appealable judgment  finding that ormco or aoa infringes at least one of the claims in the align patents 
if  however  the court issues a final  non appealable judgment of non infringement  invalidity or unenforceability with respect to each asserted claim of the align patents  all funds in the escrow account will be returned to ormco and aoa 
the settlement agreement does not affect a ormco s appeal of the decisions and orders of the district court relating to ormco s patents  or our pending cross appeal of the orders of the district court relating to our patents 
there have been two appeals 
after the permanent injunction was entered  ormco and aoa appealed that injunction and the orders of the district court on summary judgment on which that order was based 
oral argument took place on april  following oral argument  the us court of appeals for the federal circuit cafc issued a ruling declaring two out of a total of seventy one claims in our us patent no 
 and four out of a total of ten claims in us patent no 
 to be invalid as obvious 
the cafc s decision reverses the california district court summary judgment order of validity 
the  patent consists of seventy one claims  only claims and were at issue in the appeal and cafc ruling 
these two claims are directed to a system of appliances and method of repositioning teeth from an initial to a final tooth arrangement where at least some of the appliances are marked to show order of use 
these claims contain further limitations requiring instructions as to order in which the appliances are to be worn and use of the appliances in intervals of days 
the  patent consists of ten claims directed to a system for repositioning teeth that includes one or more intermediate appliances and a final appliance  provided in a single package  as well as instructions which set forth the order in which the appliances are to be worn 
the cafc s ruling pertains only to claims   and in the patent 
the majority of the claims in the  patent  including claims that address methods of fabricating aligners  digital data sets or computer generated models to fabricate appliances  are unaffected by the appeal and the cafc s ruling 
the  patent does not contain claims related to digital data  computer generated models  or methods of fabrication 
the second appeal is from the final judgment 
once final judgment was entered  ormco filed a notice of appeal from the final judgment and we filed a notice of cross appeal 
ormco has appealed the ruling of the district court that its patents are not infringed by us and that the asserted claims are invalid 
we appealed the ruling of the district court that certain claims of our  patent which were found to be infringed by ormco s and aoa s red  white blue appliances were invalid 
briefing on this appeal and cross appeal is complete  and oral argument occurred on february  other matters uspto ex parte requests during fiscal and  requests were filed with the united states patent and trademark office uspto by a san francisco  california  law firm  acting on behalf of an unnamed party  requesting ex parte re examination of our patents as follows us patent no 
request for reexamination granted initial office actions received status yes yes on january   a first office action was issued rejecting all claims of us patent no 
 the patent 
we responded to this initial office action 
a final office action was issued by the uspto on june  rejecting the pending claims of align s response 
on august   we filed an amendment in response to this final office action  which included claims discussed in an interview with the examiners 
we are awaiting further action by the uspto 
yes no we filed a preliminary amendment on july  we are awaiting an initial office action 
yes yes on july   after submitting amendments  affidavits  declarations or other documents as evidence of patentability  we received an action entitled notice of intent to issue ex parte reexamination certificate with respect to us patent no 
 the patent 
with this notice  the uspto has closed prosecution on the merits in reexamination and affirmed the patentability of all of our claims pending in reexamination in the patent 
while the patent entered the reexamination proceedings with claims  additional claims were added in the reexamination by us and the patent leaves the proceedings as a valid and enforceable patent with claims 
yes no we filed a preliminary amendment on may  we are awaiting an initial office action 
yes yes on july   we received an office action in us patent no 
 the patent confirming the patentability of claims 
while the patent entered the reexamination proceedings with claims  additional claims were added by us in the reexamination 
on september   we filed an amendment in response to the final office action with respect to the claims that were not allowed 
we are awaiting further action by the uspto 
no n a on december   in a non appealable  final order  the uspto denied the request for re examination with respect to all twenty one claims of us patent no 
 the patent 
accordingly  the validity of all twenty one claims of the patent stand reaffirmed by the uspto 
on january   a petition seeking review of denial of request for re examination of the patent was filed by the same san francisco  california law firm 
yes no the uspto has granted the requests for reexamination of the us patent no 
 we are awaiting an initial office action 
inter parte requests made by orthoclear as part of the orthoclear agreement  orthoclear agreed to take no further action with respect to the inter parte requests 
patent no 
request for reexamination granted initial office actions received status yes yes in this initial office action dated june   the examiners confirmed the validity of eight of the eleven claims of us patent no 
 the patent without amendment and preliminarily rejected the remaining claims of the patents 
the non final initial office action presented us with the first opportunity to respond to the uspto s review and interpretation of the prior art 
on september   we submitted a response to the initial office action 
we are awaiting further action by the uspto 
no n a the uspto has granted the requests for reexamination of us patent of us patent no 
 we are awaiting an initial office action 
the re examination proceedings on patent nos 
   and  collectively  the remaining patents are currently pending but we have not received an office action 
we  however  filed preliminary amendments adding additional claims regarding two of the remaining patents 
while the pending re examinations are in a preliminary stage  we believe that claims of the patents in re examination will be determined to be patentable as currently written or as may be amended during the re examination proceeding 
however  there can be no assurance that we will prevail  and re examination proceedings could result in some or all of the remaining patent claims as well as the   and patent claims having a narrower scope of coverage or even to being invalidated  which could have an adverse effect on us

overview align technology  founded in april  designs  manufactures and markets invisalign  a proprietary method for treating malocclusion  or the misalignment of teeth 
invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear  nearly invisible  removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position 
because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires  invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces 
invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens with mature dentition 
we received fda clearance to market invisalign in  and we began commercial operations and sales of full invisalign treatment in july each invisalign treatment plan is unique to the individual patient 
our full invisalign treatment consists of as many aligners as indicated by clincheck in order to achieve the doctors treatment goals 
in the third quarter of  we launched invisalign express  a low cost solution for less complex orthodontic cases 
invisalign express is a dual arch orthodontic treatment for cases that meet certain predetermined clinical criteria and consist of up to ten aligners 
invisalign express is intended to assist dental professionals to treat a broader range of patients by providing a lower cost option for adult relapse cases  minor crowding and spacing or as a pre cursor to restorative or cosmetic treatment such as veneers 
we generate the vast majority of our revenues from the sales of the invisalign system which includes full invisalign treatment and invisalign express to orthodontists and gps in the united states and canada  our domestic market 
sales of the invisalign system in our domestic gp channel and our domestic orthodontic channel represented approximately and of our total net revenues during fiscal  respectively 
our domestic full invisalign and invisalign express revenues represented and of our total net revenue during  respectively 
our international revenues represented of our total net revenue during fiscal a number of factors  the most important of which are set forth below  may affect our results during the remainder of and beyond 
settlement with orthoclear 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a formal agreement with orthoclear  inc  orthoclear holdings  inc  and orthoclear pakistan pvt 
ltd 
orthoclear  together with certain individuals associated with orthoclear the orthoclear agreement to end all pending litigation between the parties 
in addition  orthoclear agreed  among other things  to stop accepting new patient cases for treatment  consent to the entry of an exclusion order by the itc prohibiting the importation of orthoclear aligners into the united states  assign and transfer to align all intellectual property rights with application to the correction of malocclusion and to discontinue all design  manufacture  marketing and sales of removable dental aligners worldwide 
certain orthoclear principles also signed five year non compete agreements 
in accordance with the terms of the orthoclear agreement  we made a one time cash payment of million to orthoclear holdings  inc see part i  item legal proceedings of this annual report on form k for a more complete summary of the orthoclear agreement 
during the fourth quarter of  we engaged a third party firm to assist us in assessing the value of the assets received in conjunction with the orthoclear agreement 
based on this valuation  million of the million we paid to orthoclear represented the fair value of the non compete agreements 
these intangible assets were capitalized on our balance sheet and are being amortized over years beginning in the fourth quarter of the intellectual property transferred to us was determined not to have any alternative future use and therefore had no fair value 
we recorded the remaining million as settlement costs 
through the orthoclear agreement we achieved our primary objectives in the litigation as well as eliminated the costs and risks of protracted litigation 
as a result of the orthoclear agreement  we expect our legal expenses will be reduced significantly in fiscal and our management and technical personnel will be able to refocus their energy and resources on our customers and product development 
patients first program 
as part of the orthoclear agreement  orthoclear agreed to stop the importation of aligners into the united states and discontinue all aligner business operations worldwide 
as a result  most orthoclear patients were unable to complete their orthodontic treatment with orthoclear 
in an attempt to help minimize treatment disruptions for these patients and their doctors  we committed to make invisalign treatment available to orthoclear patients at no additional charge from align 
therefore  we will receive no revenue for any additional cases we start under this program while incurring significant expenses 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an expense of million for the anticipated cost of completing this program 
this amount is based on the number of orthoclear cases registered under the patients first program as of december  and the estimated costs that will be incurred in order to fulfill our obligations as a result of this program 
if the actual number of orthoclear cases under the program changes or the actual costs differ significantly from our estimates  we would be required to adjust the accrual for the patient s first program  which could materially impact our financial statements 
as of december   million remained in accrued liabilities for this program 
additionally  this program has generated increased demands on our sales and customer service representatives and on our manufacturing processes  including increased headcount 
in the fourth quarter of  we hired approximately additional dental technicians at our facility in costa rica 
training these technicians to use the sophisticated computer modeling program necessary to create clincheck treatment forms  takes approximately to days 
therefore  although we hired these additional technicians in the fourth quarter of  these individuals were not able to provide meaningful contribution to our manufacturing process until the beginning of as a result of this manufacturing constraint  although we initially sought to implement the patients first program without impacting our existing customers  or new  paid invisalign cases  the influx of patients first program cases  as well as a higher than expected number of paid invisalign case submissions in the fourth quarter  caused a delay in clincheck preparation time for some new cases by approximately days 
difficulties such as these in managing the deployment of this program  could cause us to lose existing customers  face potential customer disputes or limit the number of new customers who purchase our products or services as well as result in lost or delayed revenue which could cause a decline in our revenues  gross margins and net profits and adversely affect our operating results 
we currently anticipate that we will be able to complete the patients first program by the end of the second quarter of fiscal we expect that as we complete the patients first program cases  the incremental capacity and workforce created as a result of this program will be utilized by the anticipated increase in paid invisalign cases 
penetration into our domestic market 
as specialists  orthodontists are a critical part of our business  and we expect that orthodontists will continue to treat the majority of complex cases and continue to drive research for expanding invisalign applications 
however  there exists a significantly greater number of gps in north america than orthodontists 
as the primary provider of dental care  gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists  and possess a unique opportunity to educate these patients on the benefits of oral care and introduce them to invisalign 
gps also have the ability to refer appropriate cases to orthodontists and may choose to treat less complex cases themselves 
largely due to the fact that there are significantly more gps than orthodontists  we expect that an increasingly larger percentage of our revenues will be generated by gps 
in fact  in fiscal  our domestic gp channel generated of our total net revenue  while the orthodontic channel represented 
we continue to believe that by focusing on increasing utilization rates among our existing gp customers  the overall market for invisalign will increase  as patients who would not have otherwise sought orthodontic treatment are introduced to invisalign by their gps 
in  we expect to increase the overall marketing spend in the united states with a focus on programs designed to raise the profile of invisalign and drive more consumers to our most experienced doctors 
we anticipate that this increased consumer awareness of invisalign will increase the market for our product 
in addition  by educating dental students and orthodontic residents on the benefits of the invisalign technique  we believe they will be more likely to use this technology in their future practices and offer invisalign as a treatment option 
as of december   we have integrated the invisalign technique into the curriculums of university programs  including harvard university  columbia university  temple university and the university of texas at san antonio 
we expect additional dental schools to integrate the invisalign technique into their curriculums in the future 
product mix 
in the third quarter of  we launched invisalign express  a low cost solution for less complex orthodontic cases 
in the fourth quarter of  we experienced a decline in the number of invisalign express cases as compared to the third quarter of although we expect that the number of invisalign express cases in the first quarter of will be relatively consistent compared to the fourth quarter of  we expect to see an increasing number of invisalign express cases during the remaining quarters of continued product leadership 
we are committed to investing in delivering new products  enhancing the user experience and introducing new product features to our existing products 
in addition to invisalign express  launched in  in the second half of we announced a phased rollout of clinadvisor  a new suite of software tools designed to make invisalign case selection and submission processes more efficient for doctors 
during  we expect to extend the product features and functionality of clinadvisor and release it to an increasing number of practices 
in addition  we plan to introduce further software enhancements directed at our more experienced doctors that will provide these doctors with a robust set of tools for greater predictability  wider applicability and more control 
we are also continuing to focus our research and development efforts on a next generation aligner material as well as a compliance indicator which will help doctors and patients understand if the patients have worn their aligners for enough time to effectively move their teeth 
we expect these efforts to extend at least through by investing in developing these new products and continually enhancing our existing products  we expect to increase market share 
expansion of international markets 
we will focus our efforts towards increasing adoption of invisalign by dental professionals in key international markets  including europe and japan 
we will consider expanding into additional countries on a case by case basis 
in  our international channel represented approximately of our total net revenue primarily as a result of growth in europe 
in  we expect to increase our consumer marketing efforts in key european markets 
we expect our international revenue to continue to increase in absolute dollars  and we expect international revenue as a percentage of total net revenue will be comparable in the foreseeable future 
increasing reliance on international manufacturing operations 
our manufacturing efficiency has been and will be an important factor in our future profitability 
currently  two of our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica  dental technicians use a sophisticated  internally developed computer modeling program to prepare electronic treatment plans  which are transmitted electronically back to the us these electronic files form the basis of clincheck and are used to manufacture aligner molds 
in addition  we use ims  a third party based in juarez  mexico  for the fabrication and packaging of aligners 
our success will depend in part on the efforts and abilities of management to effectively manage these international operations  including our relationship with ims 
in addition  we currently are and will become increasingly dependant on ims s and our ability to hire and retain employees generally  as well as hire and retain employees with the necessary skills to perform the more technical aspects of our operations 
if our management and or ims fail in any of these respects  we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue 
in addition  even if we have case submissions in the manufacturing backlog  if for these or other reasons we do not have sufficient number of trained dental technicians in costa rica to create the clincheck treatment forms or if ims is unable to ship our product to our customers on a timely basis  our revenue will be delayed or lost which will cause our operating results to fluctuate 
see part i  item a risk factors for risks related to our international operations 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment fas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values over the requisite service period 
in accordance with the modified prospective method  our financial statements for the prior periods have not been restated to reflect and do not include the impact of fas r 
for the year ended december   stock based compensation expense recognized in accordance with fas r is as follows in thousands year ended december  stock based compensation of net revenues cost of revenues sales and marketing general and administrative research and development total stock based compensation expense results of operations comparison of years ended december   and revenues our total net revenues decreased by million or to million in compared to million in the decline in total net revenues resulted from reduced revenues in the orthodontic channel offset by increases in the gp channel  international and other revenues 
in  the domestic orthodontic and gp channels were impacted by lower overall average selling prices due to new pricing initiatives and the full year effect of our lower priced invisalign express product  all of which were introduced in the second half of invisalign product revenues by channel and other revenue  which represented training and sales of ancillary products for the years ended december   and  are as follows years ended december  net revenues change change change change in millions domestic ortho full ortho express total ortho revenues gp full gp express total gp revenues international total invisalign revenues other revenue total net revenues invisalign express was launched in the third quarter of case volume data which represents invisalign case shipment by channel  for the years ended december   and are as follows years ended december  case volume change change change change in thousands domestic ortho full ortho express total ortho volume gp full gp express total gp volume international total invisalign volume invisalign express was launched in the third quarter of revenues from our domestic orthodontic channel decreased million or in compared to as a result of a decline in full invisalign revenues of million partially offset by a million increase in invisalign express revenues 
the decline in full invisalign revenues is attributed to lower average selling prices and case volumes 
in the reduced average selling price of the full invisalign product reflects the full year impact of pricing initiatives introduced in the second half of  including the reduction in the list price of our full invisalign product and the expansion of our volume based discount program 
additionally  the increase in invisalign express revenue resulted from higher case volumes in compared to  since this product was launched in the third quarter of revenues from our domestic gp channel increased million or in compared to primarily due to an increase in invisalign express revenues of million partially offset by a million decline in full invisalign revenues 
invisalign express revenues increased resulting from higher case volumes in compared to  since this product was launched in the third quarter of the reduction in full invisalign revenues is attributed to lower average selling prices which reflect the full year impact of the pricing initiatives mentioned above 
international revenues increased million or in compared to primarily due to a significant increase in our international invisalign case volumes partially offset by a lower average selling price as a result of pricing initiatives introduced in the first quarter of other revenues  which primarily consisted of training and sales of ancillary products  increased million in fiscal compared to mainly due to a million increase in training revenues resulting from an increase in training fees 
net revenue grew by for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the growth in net revenues resulted primarily from an increase in overall case shipment volume in the domestic gp channel driven by an increase in the number of participating clinicians and the launch of invisalign express in the third quarter of additionally  our international sales improved primarily as a result of increased number of participating clinicians and case utilization by our european practitioners 
for fiscal year  we expect our total net revenues will increase compared to primarily due to the anticipated case volume increases in our domestic orthodontic and gp channels  as well as in international markets 
we expect our average selling price to be flat to slightly lower compared to primarily due to increased participation in our volume based discount programs 
cost of revenues years ended december  change change in millions cost of revenues of net revenues gross profits of net revenues cost of revenues includes salaries for staff involved in the production process  costs incurred by ims  a third party shelter service provider in juarez  mexico  the cost of materials  packaging  shipping costs  depreciation on capital equipment used in the production process  training costs and stock based compensation expense 
gross margin decreased to of net revenues in compared to in primarily due to lower average selling prices 
this decline in average selling prices is attributable to the reduction in the list price of full invisalign and increased sales of our lower priced invisalign express product 
reductions in product costs driven by increased volumes and manufacturing efficiencies including the relocation of the sla mold operations to juarez  mexico  partially offset the impact of lower average selling prices 
in addition  as a result of these efficiencies  we also released a million provision for estimated losses on case refinement sales during fiscal gross margin improved to of net revenues for the fiscal year ended december   compared to of net revenues for the year ended december  this improvement in gross margin is primarily the result of cost savings achieved from manufacturing process improvements and increased cost absorption due to higher production volumes partially offset by increased training costs as a result of dental professionals auditing training classes for no charge 
for the fiscal year  we anticipate that our gross margin will be slightly higher compared to primarily due to impact of the expected increase in case volume and manufacturing efficiencies including a full year effect of the relocation of the sla mold operations to juarez  mexico 
sales and marketing years ended december  change change in millions sales and marketing of net revenues sales and marketing expense includes sales force compensation combined with travel related costs and expenses for professional marketing programs  conducting workshops and market surveys  advertising  dental professional trade show attendance and stock based compensation expense 
sales and marketing expense increased million in compared to primarily due to a million increase in payroll expense mainly attributable to an increase in headcount and the replacement of orthodontic sales representatives who left align in the first half of  and a million increase in stock based compensation expense 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in media  advertising and other marketing expenses due to the initial launch of our consumer marketing campaign in the second quarter of sales and marketing expense increased by million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily related to incremental headcount which resulted in higher payroll costs of million  million related to increased advertising  media and trade show costs  an additional million on outside services and other sales and marketing support costs  and million of expenses attributable to retention incentives and guarantees paid to our sales force in response to the solicitation of our sales force by orthoclear during the first quarter of for fiscal  we expect sales and marketing expense  including stock based compensation  to be slightly higher than  as we expand our international markets  continue to increase our investment in media programs and provide clinical education 
general and administrative years ended december  change change in millions general and administrative of net revenues general and administrative expense includes salaries for administrative personnel  outside consulting services  legal expenses and stock based compensation expense 
general and administrative expense increased by million in compared to primarily due to a million increase in external legal fees primarily related to the orthoclear litigation  a million increase in payroll related expenses primarily resulting from the hiring of additional legal and administrative staff  and a million increase in stock based compensation expense 
partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease in bad debt expense 
general and administrative expense increased by million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  primarily due to incremental expenses related to the orthoclear litigation  which included a million increase in external legal fees  a million increase in consulting costs and a million increase in payroll expense for employee retention and the hiring of additional legal staff 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in stock based compensation expense in connection with the amortization of deferred stock based compensation related to option grants prior to for fiscal year  we expect that general and administrative expense will decrease from fiscal primarily as a result of the significant reduction in legal and other expenses following the settlement agreement we entered into with orthoclear in the fourth quarter of research and development years ended december  change change in millions research and development of net revenues research and development expense includes the personnel costs associated with software engineering  the cost of designing  developing and testing our products  conducting clinical and post marketing trials and stock based compensation expense 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
research and development expense decreased million in compared to  primarily due to a million decrease in temporary services and outside consulting expenses partially offset by million increase in stock based compensation 
research and development expense increased by million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the primary reasons for the higher expenses in  compared to  were an increase of million in outside service and consulting expenses  million of additional payroll related costs due to higher headcount and a million increase in training and other research and development expenses 
for fiscal  we expect research and development spending to increase from fiscal as we continue to invest in research and development efforts to bring new products to market  conduct clinical research and focus on product improvement initiatives 
patients first program and settlement costs years ended december  change change in millions patients first program and settlement costs of net revenues patients first program and settlement costs consisted of a million charge for anticipated costs of patients first program combined with million in settlement cost  for a total of million 
this amount is separately disclosed on our december  consolidated statement of operations 
as part of the orthoclear agreement  orthoclear agreed to stop the importation of aligners into the united states and discontinue all aligner business operations worldwide 
as a result  most orthoclear patients were unable to complete their orthodontic treatment with orthoclear 
in an attempt to help minimize treatment disruptions for the orthoclear patients and their doctors  we committed to make treatment available to these patients at no additional cost under the patients first program 
we will receive no revenue for the program  and will incur significant expense to complete these cases 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an million charge for the anticipated costs of completing this program in accordance with fasb statement  accounting for contingencies fas 
this amount is based on the number of orthoclear cases registered under the patients first program as of december  and the estimated costs that will be incurred to fulfill our obligations as a result of this program 
if the actual number of orthoclear cases under the program changes or the actual costs differs significantly from our estimates  we would be required to adjust the accrual for the patients first program  and it could materially impact our financial statements 
we currently anticipate that we will be able to complete the patients first program by the end of the second quarter of fiscal we paid million to orthoclear during the fourth quarter of in accordance with the terms of the orthoclear agreement  of which million was capitalized on our balance sheet representing the fair value of the non compete agreements and is being amortized over years

interest income expense  net for the year ended december  increased million compared to the increase was primarily due to increased interest income as a result of higher effective interest rates 
other income expense increased million in compared to  primarily due to a million increase in foreign currency translation gains resulted primarily from the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
interest and other income and expenses for the year ended december   included interest income of million  which resulted from higher interest rates and average cash balances during  offset by exchange losses of million and million of interest expense  bank charges and other expense 
income tax provision years ended december  change change in millions provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million in fiscal  representing effective tax rates of  and for  and  respectively 
as of december   we have recorded a full valuation allowance for our existing deferred tax assets due to uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize these assets before they expire 
as a result  our income tax provision is based upon our operating results for each taxable jurisdiction in which we operate and the amount of statutory tax that we incur in each jurisdiction 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal tax purposes and million for california state tax purposes 
if not utilized  these carryforwards will begin to expire in for federal purposes and for california purposes 
sfas r prohibits recognition of a deferred income tax asset for excess tax benefits due to stock option exercises that have not yet been realized through a reduction in income taxes payable 
such unrecognized deferred tax benefits totaled million as of december  and will be accounted for as a credit to additional paid in capital  if and when realized through a reduction in income taxes payable 
the internal revenue code imposes an annual limitation on the use of a corporation s tax attributes if a corporation undergoes an ownership change for tax purposes 
if an ownership change is determined to have occurred  our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation 
however  based on our current estimate of the total net operating losses at december  and our current estimate of the annual limitation  we do not expect our net operating loss carryforwards to be limited 
at december   we had research credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal purposes and million for california state tax purposes 
if not utilized  the federal credit carryforwards will begin to expire in the california state credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
we have not provided additional us income taxes on undistributed earnings from non us operations as of december  because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the united states 
liquidity and capital resources we fund our operations from the proceeds of the sale of our common stock  from cash generated from sales of our product and occasional borrowing under available credit facilities 
as of december   and  we had the following cash  cash equivalents and short term investments years ended december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents restricted cash short term investments total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million  resulting primarily from our operating loss of million adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation totaling million 
additionally  a million increase in current assets and a million reduction in deferred revenue partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities also contributed to the cash used in operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   was million  primarily from operating profits adjusted for non cash items and increases in accrued liabilities partially offset by reductions in accounts payable 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily due to a million purchase of intangible assets resulting from the orthoclear agreement  million for the purchase of capital assets and million net purchase of short term marketable securities 
we used million of cash for our investing activities during the year ended december  this included million of cash used to purchase capital assets  and million of net cash used to purchase general orthodontics  llc 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and primarily consisted of million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock  primarily from exercises of employee stock options and million in net proceeds from our line of credit 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   which consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock  primarily from exercises of employee stock options  partially offset by payments on debt obligations related to the equipment based term loan and capital lease obligations 
net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options have historically been a significant component of our liquidity 
however  in  we began granting rsus which  unlike stock options  do not generate cash from exercise 
in addition  because rsus are taxable to the individuals when they vest  the number of shares we issued to each of our executive officers will be net of applicable payroll withholding taxes which taxes will be paid by us on their behalf 
as a result  we will likely generate less cash from the proceeds of the sale of our common stock in future periods 
in december  we renegotiated and amended our existing revolving line of credit to increase the available borrowings under the then existing revolving line to million 
included in the revolving line of credit is a letter of credit facility of up to million  a foreign exchange facility of up to million and an equipment facility of up to million 
we may elect interest rates on our borrowing calculated by reference to bank s prime rate less one half of one percent or libor plus two percent 
the credit facility matures on december   at which time all outstanding borrowings must be repaid 
the credit facility contains certain restrictive loan covenants  including  among others  financial covenants requiring a minimum quick ratio and minimum tangible net worth  and covenants limiting our ability to dispose of assets  make acquisitions  be acquired  incur indebtedness  grant liens  make investments  pay dividends and repurchase stock 
in december  we amended our credit agreement whereby the only financial covenant for the fourth quarter of was a certain minimum cash balance 
as of december   we are in compliance with the financial covenant of these credit facilities 
during the third quarter of  we borrowed million against these credit facilities and made a million one time payment to orthoclear holdings  inc in accordance with the terms of the orthoclear agreement 
we elected libor plus two percent as an interest rate of as of december  we repaid million of this borrowing in the fourth quarter of  the outstanding balance as of december  was million and is classified as current liability 
on march   we renegotiated and amended our existing credit facility with comerica bank 
the amendment  among other things  reduced financial covenants to require only a quick ratio covenant 
additionally  the amendment also increased the available borrowings under the existing revolving line of credit from million to million effective january  the amended credit facility matures on december  at which point all outstanding borrowing under this credit facility must be repaid 
contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years principal payment on line of credit other contractual obligations operating lease obligations computer support services total other contractual obligation total includes an early termination fee on facility in amsterdam  the netherlands 
the lease expires in with an option to cancel in we have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k item a as of december we expect that our expense levels for will remain comparable to  depending on our level of business activity 
we expect that any increases will be focused on continued marketing and international sales efforts and research and development expenses as we develop new products and improvements to our existing products 
in addition  we may use cash to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies 
our capital requirements depend on market acceptance of our products and our ability to market  sell and support our products on a worldwide basis 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows  we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing  collaborative or other arrangements with other companies  bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we could be required to delay establishing a national brand  building manufacturing infrastructure and developing our product and process technology  and reduce our expenditures in general 
accordingly  the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to revenue recognition  stock based compensation and income taxes 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we enter into arrangements to sell products  services  and other arrangements that contain multiple elements or multiple deliverables of products in the future 
revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues from product sales  net of discounts and rebates  are recognized upon shipment 
service revenues are recorded when performance is completed 
other revenue arrangements with multiple elements are recognized as delivery occurs 
we use vendor specific objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the undelivered elements and recognize the residual revenue for the delivered items upon shipment 
revenues for the undelivered elements are deferred based on a historical case refinement utilization rate  or breakage factor  and are recognized when delivery occurs 
actual utilization rates could differ from the historical breakage factor requiring future adjustments to revenue 
in addition  changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition but would not change the total revenue recognized 
stock based compensation expense effective january   we adopted the modified prospective transition method of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment fas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including stock options and restricted stock units related to our plan and our plan and employee stock purchases related to our employee stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values over requisite employee service period 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of fas r 
our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  reflect the impact of fas r related to share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of fasb statement  accounting for stock based compensation fas and stock based payment awards granted subsequent to december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r 
in conjunction with the adoption of fas r  we changed our method of attributing the value of stock based compensation to expense from the accelerated multiple option approach to the straight line single option method 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using a black scholes valuation model  consistent with the provisions of fas r and the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected term and stock price volatility 
judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements for the year ended december  is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
fas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if our estimates change or if we employ different assumptions in the application of fas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under fas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially impact our results of operations 
see note shareholders equity of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
on october   the compensation committee of the board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting for all unvested stock options with exercise prices greater than 
options held by non employee directors were excluded from the vesting acceleration 
the fair market value of our common stock on the date of acceleration was as quoted on the nasdaq global market 
as a result of the acceleration  approximately million options or of the then total outstanding options became immediately exercisable as of october  the purpose of the acceleration was to eliminate future compensation expense we would otherwise recognize in our statement of operations with respect to these accelerated options upon the adoption of fas r 
long lived assets  including finite lived purchased intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives  unless these lives are determined to be indefinite 
intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization is computed over the estimated useful life of the respective asset 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas 
we perform an impairment test whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or circumstances include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for its business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and or a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period 
impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value  and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analyses 
no intangible asset impairment was recorded for the periods presented 
patients first program as part of the orthoclear settlement agreement  orthoclear agreed to stop the importation of aligners into the united states and discontinue all aligner business operations worldwide 
as a result  most orthoclear patients were unable to complete their orthodontic treatment with orthoclear 
in an attempt to help minimize treatment disruptions for the orthoclear patients and their doctors  we committed to make treatment available to these patients at no additional cost under the patients first program 
we will receive no revenue for the program  and will incur significant expense to complete these cases 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded s million charge for the anticipated costs of completing this program in accordance with fasb statement  accounting for contingencies fas 
this amount is based on the number of orthoclear cases registered under the patients first program as of december  and the estimated costs that will be incurred to fulfill our obligations as a result of this program 
if the actual number of orthoclear cases under the program changes or the actual costs differs significantly from our estimates  we would be required to adjust the accrual for the patients first program  and it could materially impact our financial statements 
we currently anticipate that we will be able to complete the patients first program by the end of the second quarter of fiscal product warranty we warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship until the invisalign case is completed 
we accrue for estimated warranty in costs of goods sold upon the shipment of products 
the amount of accrued estimated warranty costs are primarily based on historical experience as to product failures as well as current information on repair costs 
actual warranty costs could differ from the estimated amounts 
we regularly review the accrued balances and update these balances based on historical warranty cost trends 
actual warranty costs incurred have not materially differed from those accrued 
if we were to experience higher rates of warranty events  we would be required to accrue additional warranty costs  which would negatively affect our operating results 
deferred tax valuation allowance we have established a full valuation allowance because we believe the realization of our deferred tax assets is not likely 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we show on our balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
to the extent we believe that realization is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the full valuation allowance  we would decrease the valuation allowance to take into account deferred tax assets that we could realize 
a decrease in the valuation allowance could have a favorable impact  which could be material  on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we make the decrease

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations 
interest rate risk changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable equity securities 
due to the short duration of our cash and cash equivalents an immediate decrease or more in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows 
periodically we invest our excess cash in low risk and short term available for sale marketable equity securities 
these investments are primarily at fixed interest rates 
as of december   we had million investments in available for sale marketable equity securities 
as of december   we had million outstanding borrowing against our line of credit  which bears interest rate of libor plus two percent being as of december  and are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate increases 
an increase of or more in interest rates may affect our future cost of financing 
in the past we had used fixed rates long term financing to minimize our risk on interest rates increases 
currency rate risk the functional currency of align and its subsidiaries is the us dollar and  accordingly  gains and losses resulting from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in euro  cost rican colon  and other currencies are reflected in the determination of net income or loss 
we do not enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses 
included in other income expense for the year ended december   was an exchanges gain of million 
for years and we experienced exchange loss of million and an exchange gain of million  respectively  primarily related to euro denominated balances 
an aggregate decline of in foreign currency exchange rates relative to usd may have an adverse effect of approximately million on our results of operations and financial position
