this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including those set forth under risk factors forward looking statements and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we offer consumers a variety of consumer protection services and other consumer products and services primarily on a subscription basis 
our services help consumers protect themselves against identity theft or fraud and understand and monitor their credit profiles and other personal information 
through our acquisition of chartered marketing services  inc  in july of  we expanded our portfolio of services to include consumer discounts on healthcare  home  and auto related expenses  access to professional financial and legal information  and life  accidental death and disability insurance products 
our consumer services are offered through relationships with clients  including many of the largest financial institutions in the united states and canada  and clients in other industries 
we also offer our services directly to consumers 
our products and services are marketed to customers of our clients  and often are branded and tailored to meet our clients specifications 
our clients are principally credit card or mortgage issuing financial institutions  including many of the largest financial institutions in the united states and canada 
with certain of our financial institution clients  we have broadened our marketing efforts to access demand deposit accounts and selling at the point of personal contact in branches 
our financial institution clients currently account for the majority of our existing subscriber base 
we also are continuing to augment our client base through relationships with insurance companies  mortgage companies  brokerage companies  associations  travel companies  retail companies  web and technology companies and other service providers with significant market presence and brand loyalty 
with our clients  our services are marketed to potential subscribers through a variety of marketing channels  including direct mail  outbound telemarketing  inbound telemarketing  inbound customer service and account activation calls  email  mass media and the internet 
our marketing arrangements with our clients sometimes call for us to fund and manage marketing activity 
the mix between our company funded and client funded marketing programs varies from year to year based upon our and our clients strategies 
we expect to substantially increase our own investment in marketing with one or more clients in in addition  in we began expanding our efforts to market our consumer products and services directly to consumers 
we conduct our consumer direct marketing primarily through the internet 
we also may market through other channels  including direct mail  outbound telemarketing  inbound telemarketing  email and mass media 
we expect to make a significant investment in marketing direct to consumers in we also offer data security breach services to organizations responding to compromises of sensitive personal information 
we help these clients notify the affected individuals and we provide the affected individuals with identity theft recovery and credit monitoring services offered by our clients at no charge to the affected individuals 
in addition  through our subsidiary screening international  llc  we provide personnel and vendor background screening services to businesses worldwide 
screening international was formed in may  by combining our subsidiary american background services  inc  with the background screening division of control risks group  ltd  a company based in the united kingdom 
we have two reportable segments 
our consumer products and services segment includes our consumer protection and other consumer products and services 
our background screening segment includes the personnel and vendor background screening services provided by screening international 
our client arrangements are distinguished from one another by the allocation between us and the client of the economic risk and reward of the marketing campaigns 
the general characteristics of each arrangement are described below  although the arrangements with particular clients may contain unique characteristics direct marketing arrangements under direct marketing arrangements  we bear most of the new subscriber marketing costs and pay our client a commission for revenue derived from subscribers 
these arrangements generally result in negative cash flow over the first several months after a program is launched due to the upfront nature of the marketing investments 
in some arrangements we pay the client a service fee for access to the client s customers or billing of the subscribers by the client 
indirect marketing arrangements under indirect marketing arrangements  our client bears the marketing expense and pays us a service fee or percentage of the revenue 
because the subscriber acquisition cost is borne by our client under these arrangements  our revenue per subscriber is typically lower than that under direct marketing arrangements 
indirect marketing arrangements generally provide positive cash flow earlier than direct arrangements and the ability to obtain subscribers and utilize marketing channels that the clients otherwise may not make available 
shared marketing arrangements under shared marketing arrangements  marketing expenses are shared by us and the client in various proportions  and we may pay a commission to or receive a service fee from the client 
revenue generally is split in proportion to the investment made by our client and us 
the classification of a client relationship as direct  indirect or shared is based on whether we or the client pay the marketing expenses 
our accounting policies for revenue recognition  however  are not based on the classification of a client arrangement as direct  indirect or shared 
we look to the specific client arrangement to determine the appropriate revenue recognition policy  as discussed in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our typical contracts for direct marketing arrangements  and some indirect and shared marketing arrangements  provide that after termination of the contract we may continue to provide our services to existing subscribers  for periods ranging from two years to no specific termination period  under the economic arrangements that existed at the time of termination 
under certain of our agreements  however  including most indirect marketing arrangements and some shared marketing arrangements  the clients may require us to cease providing services under existing subscriptions 
clients under some contracts may also require us to cease providing services to their customers under existing subscriptions if the contract is terminated for material breach by us 
we look to the specific client arrangement to determine the appropriate revenue recognition policy  as discussed in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
as shown in the following table  the number of subscribers from our indirect  direct and shared marketing arrangements  have increased over the past three fiscal years as of december  indirect marketing arrangements direct and shared marketing arrangements total subscribers subscribers in our consumer products and services segment from indirect marketing arrangements have grown from as of december  and as of december  to of total subscribers as of december  while our direct and shared marketing arrangements tend to provide us higher operating margins in periods after the marketing costs have been amortized  under our indirect arrangements we receive higher operating margins in the first year  have the opportunity to acquire a greater number of subscribers and generally experience improved retention due to marketing primarily through inbound channels 
the classification of a client relationship as direct  indirect or shared is based on whether we or the client pay the marketing expenses 
our accounting policies for revenue recognition  however  are not based on the classification of a client arrangement as direct  indirect or shared 
the number of cancellations within the first days as a percentage of new subscribers was in  in and in the number of cancellations within the first days of subscription  as a percentage of new subscribers was lower during the year ended december  compared to the same period last year 
we analyze subscriber cancellations during the first days because we believe this time period affords the subscriber the opportunity to evaluate the service 
the number of cancellations after the first days  which are measured as a percentage of the number of subscribers at the beginning of the year plus new subscribers during the year less cancellations within the first days  was in  in and in the total number of cancellations during the year as a percentage of the beginning of the year subscribers plus new subscriber additions  was in  in and in conversely  our retention rates  calculated by taking subscribers at the end of the year divided by subscribers at the beginning of the year plus additions for the year  increased from in to in and in revenue from subscribers obtained through our largest clients in  and as a percentage of total revenue  and the principal contract arrangements with those clients  were as follows percentage of revenue for the years ended december  client relationship american express shared marketing discover direct marketing discover indirect marketing capital one direct and through equifax agreement indirect marketing citibank direct marketing citibank indirect marketing bank of america includes mbna shared direct marketing our relationship with american express travel related services  or american express  was a shared marketing arrangement under an agreement that expired on december  under a services transition agreement with american express  we provided our current consumer services through may   to subscribers who paid for the service through their amex credit cards 
we were compensated for those services through april   based on the commission structure in effect under the existing agreement with american express  and from may   to may   based on a service fee per subscriber 
we have not serviced those subscribers since may  the services transition agreement also provided that we maintain the perpetual and unrestricted right to provide our services to all subscribers who are currently paying for the consumer services through payment vehicles other than american express credit cards  and to all subscribers who are receiving our combined personal and business credit information services regardless of how those subscribers are billed 
we have not been required to pay any commission on those subscribers since january  we will have the right to offer our other products and services to those subscribers  and the services transition agreement prohibits either party from knowingly soliciting subscribers retained by the other party under the agreement 
as a result of the services transition agreement  since may   we ceased servicing approximately of our subscribers obtained through american express  which accounts for approximately of the revenue generated through the american express relationship 
american express also reimbursed us in the amount of one million dollars  for certain marketing expenses incurred in in november  we entered into a master services agreement with equifax under which we provided various services 
we recently amended the master agreement to continue the term to november   with automatic renewal for an additional year renewal term unless either party terminates the agreement upon notice of non renewal months or more prior to expiration of the original term 
even if the master agreement is not terminated  however  either party may terminate the receipt of particular services from the other party on days prior notice 
with the exception of services to capital one customers acquired prior to january   we are not providing any services under that agreement 
prior to january   we provided our identity theft protection and credit management services under the master agreement with equifax to customers of capital one bank  or capital one  which marketed those services to consumers under an agreement between capital one and equifax 
on september   we entered into a marketing and services agreement with capital one under which  effective january   our services are marketed by capital one to its customers 
the services marketed to capital one customers under this agreement are substantially all of the services previously marketed through the master agreement between us and equifax  in addition to other services 
through our agreement with equifax  however  we continue to provide our services to the customers of capital one who enrolled for the services prior to january  some of our top revenue producing clients have re negotiated pricing with us over the last few months 
although some of these efforts resulted in lower prices for some products  we expect that increasing volumes and changing of the sales mix to higher priced products will provide continued growth with these clients 
critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
the application of our critical accounting policies requires an evaluation of a number of complex criteria and significant accounting judgments by us 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on identity theft  credit management and background services and accidental death insurance and other membership products 
our products and services are offered to consumers principally on a monthly subscription basis 
subscription fees are generally billed directly to the subscriber s credit card  mortgage bill or demand deposit accounts 
the prices to subscribers of various configurations of our products and services range generally from to per month 
as a means of allowing customers to become familiar with our services  we sometimes offer free trial or guaranteed refund periods

s and a persuasive evidence of arrangement exists as we maintain signed contracts with all of our large financial institution customers and paper and electronic confirmations with individual purchases  b delivery has occurred once the product is transmitted over the internet  c the seller s price to the buyer is fixed as sales are generally based on contract or list prices and payments from large financial institutions are collected within days with no significant write offs  and d collectibility is reasonably assured as individual customers pay by credit card which has limited our risk of non collection 
revenue for monthly subscriptions is recognized in the month the subscription fee is earned 
for subscriptions with refund provisions whereby only the prorated subscription fee is refunded upon cancellation by the subscriber  deferred subscription fees are recorded when billed and amortized as subscription fee revenue on a straight line basis over the subscription period  generally one year 
we generate revenue from one time credit reports and background screenings which are recognized when the report is provided to the customer electronically  which is generally at the time of completion 
revenue for annual subscription fees must be deferred if the subscriber has the right to cancel the service 
annual subscriptions include subscribers with full refund provisions at any time during the subscription period and pro rata refund provisions 
revenue related to annual subscription with full refund provisions is recognized on the expiration of these refund provisions 
revenue related to annual subscribers with pro rata provisions is recognized based on a pro rata share of revenue earned 
an allowance for monthly subscription refunds is established based on our actual cancellation experience 
we also provide services for which certain financial institution clients are the primary obligors directly to their customers 
revenue from these arrangements is recognized when earned  which is at the time we provide the service  generally on a monthly basis 
in addition  we generate revenue from the sale of one time credit reports and background screens  which is generally at the time of completion 
the amount of revenue recorded by us is determined in accordance with financial accounting standards board s fasb emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  which addresses whether a company should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained by us amount billed less commissions or fees paid 
we generally record revenue on a gross basis in the amount that we bill the subscriber when our arrangements with financial institution clients provide for us to serve as the primary obligor in the transaction  we have latitude in establishing price and we bear the risk of physical loss of inventory and credit risk for the amount billed to the subscriber 
we generally record revenue in the amount that we bill our financial institution clients  and not the amount billed to their customers  when our financial institution client is the primary obligor  establishes price to the customer and bears the credit risk 
accidental death insurance and other membership products the point in time at which we recognize revenue from our services is determined in accordance with sab no 
 as amended by sab no 
consistent with the requirements of sab no 
s and  a persuasive evidence of arrangement exists as we maintain paper and electronic confirmations with individual purchases  b delivery has occurred at the completion of a product trial period  c the seller s price to the buyer is fixed as the price of the product is agreed to by the customer as a condition of the sales transaction which established the sales arrangement  and d collectibility is reasonably assured as evidenced by our collection of revenue through the monthly mortgage payments of our customers or through checking account debits to our customers accounts 
revenues from insurance contracts are recognized when earned 
marketing of our insurance products generally involves a trial period during which time the product is made available at no cost to the customer 
no revenues are recognized until applicable trial periods are completed 
the amount of revenue recorded by us is determined in accordance with fasb s eitf  which addresses whether a company should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained by us amount billed less commissions or fees paid 
for insurance products we generally record revenue on a net basis as we perform as an agent or broker for the insurance products without assuming the risks of ownership of the insurance products 
for membership products  we generally record revenue on a gross basis as we serve as the primary obligor in the transactions  have latitude in establishing price and bear credit risk for the amount billed to the subscriber 
we participate in agency relationships with insurance carriers that underwrite insurance products offered by us 
accordingly  insurance premiums collected from customers and remitted to insurance carriers are excluded from our revenues and operating expenses 
insurance premiums collected but not remitted to insurance carriers as of december  totaled million 
deferred subscription solicitation and commission costs deferred subscription solicitation and commission costs include direct response marketing costs and deferred commissions 
our deferred subscription solicitation costs consist of subscription acquisition costs  including telemarketing  web based marketing expenses and direct mail such as printing and postage 
telemarketing  web based marketing and direct mail expenses are direct response advertising costs  which are accounted for in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  reporting on advertising costs sop 
the recoverability of amounts capitalized as deferred subscription solicitation costs are evaluated at each balance sheet date  in accordance with sop  by comparing the carrying amounts of such assets on a cost pool basis to the probable remaining future benefit expected to result directly from such advertising costs 
probable remaining future benefit is estimated based upon historical subscriber patterns  and represents net revenues less costs to earn those revenues 
in estimating probable future benefit on a per subscriber basis we deduct our contractual cost to service that subscriber from the known sales price 
we then apply the future benefit on a per subscriber basis to the number of subscribers expected to be retained in the future to arrive at the total probable future benefit 
in estimating the number of subscribers we will retain ie  factoring in expected cancellations  we utilize historical subscriber patterns maintained by us that show attrition rates by client  product and marketing channel 
the total probable future benefit is then compared to the costs of a given marketing campaign ie  cost pools  and if the probable future benefit exceeds the cost pool  the amount is considered to be recoverable 
if direct response advertising costs were to exceed the estimated probable remaining future benefit  an adjustment would be made to the deferred subscription costs to the extent of any shortfall 
we amortize deferred subscription solicitation costs on a cost pool basis over the period during which the future benefits are expected to be received  but no more than months 
in accordance with sab no 
 as amended by sab no 
 commissions that relate to annual subscriptions with full refund provisions and monthly subscriptions are expensed in the month incurred  unless we are entitled to a refund of the commissions 
if annual subscriptions are cancelled prior to their initial terms  we are generally entitled to a full refund of the previously paid commission for those annual subscriptions with a full refund provision and a pro rata refund  equal to the unused portion of their subscription  for those annual subscriptions with a pro rata refund provision 
commissions that relate to annual subscriptions with full commission refund provisions are deferred until the earlier of expiration of the refund privileges or cancellation 
once the refund privileges have expired  the commission costs are recognized ratably in the same pattern that the related revenue is recognized 
commissions that relate to annual subscriptions with pro rata refund provisions are deferred and charged to operations as the corresponding revenue is recognized 
if a subscription is cancelled  upon receipt of the refunded commission from our client  we record a reduction to the deferred commission 
software development costs we develop software for internal use and capitalize software development costs incurred during the application development stage in accordance with sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use and eitf  accounting for web site development cost 
costs incurred prior to and after the application development stage are charged to expense 
when the software is ready for its intended use  capitalization ceases and such costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life  which is generally three to five years 
in accordance with sop  the company regularly reviews its capitalized software projects for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we did not have any impairments in the year ended december  goodwill and other intangibles we record as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
the determination of fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired was determined based upon a third party valuation and evaluation of other information 
statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  prescribes a two step process for impairment testing of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives  which is performed annually  as well as when an event triggering impairment may have occurred 
the first step tests for impairment  while the second step  if necessary  measures the impairment 
we elected to perform our annual analysis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year as of october and no indicators of impairment were identified 
intangible assets subject to amortization include trademarks  customer marketing and technology related asses 
such intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which are generally three to ten years 
the goodwill and intangibles balances as of december  pertain to the acquisitions of american background on november   screening international on may  and chartered marketing services on july  recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  sfas  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
the statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles  and changes for accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impractical to do so 
sfas was effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with this interpretation is a two step process 
the first step is recognition the enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  the enterprise should presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we will adopt the provisions of fin on january  we are currently evaluating the provisions of fin and have not yet completed our determination of the impact of adoption on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement 
therefore  a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
or sfas sfas permits an entity  at specified election dates  to choose to measure certain financial instruments and other items at fair value 
the objective of sfas is to provide entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently  without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is effective for accounting periods beginning after november we are currently assessing the impact of adopting sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items on our statement of operations as a percentage of revenue year ended december  revenue operating expenses marketing commission cost of revenue general and administrative depreciation and amortization impairment of software development total operating expenses operating income interest income  net other income  net income before taxes and minority interest income tax expense benefit minority interest in net loss of subsidiary net income we have two reportable segments

revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributed to a million increase in consumer products and services and a million increase in background screening services 
the increase in consumer products and services is primarily the result of an increase in our subscriber base to million subscribers for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of 
the growth in our subscriber base has been accomplished primarily through continued marketing efforts with new and existing clients  as well as increased revenue from additional insurance and other consumer products and services as a result of the acquisition of chartered marketing services 
this increase was partially offset by a decline in revenue as a result of the loss of american express as a client in may of our relationship with american express amex  was a shared marketing arrangement under an agreement that expired on december  and on december  we entered into a services transition agreement with american express 
as a result of the services transition agreement  after may   we ceased servicing approximately of our subscribers obtained through american express  which accounted for approximately of the revenue generated through american express relationship 
in order to maintain and continue to grow our revenue  we have offset this loss of revenue from existing and new client relationships and other products and services 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we experienced a significant increase in the rate of credit card declines at one of our clients due to changes to the manner in which the client administers third party products 
this increase in decline rates occurred simultaneously with a system conversion implemented at the client  and was originally believed to be the result of conversion errors 
as a result  we continued providing service to these customers throughout the fourth quarter and into the beginning of  while working with the client to investigate and address the causes of the increased decline rates 
we estimate the lost revenue impact to fourth quarter to be million as a result of this increase in credit card decline rates 
in the first quarter of  we successfully collected approximately thousand in revenue by re billing the impacted customers 
we also expect to cancel service to approximately to thousand subscribers from this client  and have made adjustments to our going forward assumptions on credit card decline rates associated with this client 
the table below shows the percentage of subscribers generated from indirect marketing arrangements 
year ended december  percentage of subscribers from indirect marketing arrangements to total subscribers percentage of new subscribers acquired from indirect marketing arrangements to total new subscribers acquired percentage of revenue from indirect marketing arrangements to total subscription revenue the increase in background screening is primarily a result of the addition of our operations in the united kingdom in june as a result of the formation of screening international by combining our subsidiary american background information services  inc  with the background screening division of control risks group  and an increase in our domestic background screening volume 
marketing expenses 
marketing expenses consist of subscriber acquisition costs  including telemarketing  web based marketing and direct mail expenses such as printing and postage 
marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily a result of an increase in the cost of marketing directly to the consumer  as well as increased marketing costs related to additional insurance and membership costs as the result of the acquisition of chartered marketing services 
amortization of deferred subscription solicitation costs related to marketing for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
subscription solicitation costs related to marketing costs expensed as incurred for the year ended december  and were million and thousand  respectively 
as a percentage of revenue  marketing expenses increased to for the year ended december  from for year ended december  primarily as the result of an increase in direct to consumer marketing 
we are seeing a shift back to more direct marketing due to the acquisition of chartered marketing services  the increase in our commitment to consumer direct and the relationship with a major new financial institution client 
in  our marketing expense was million and we expect it to be about higher in the services transition agreement with american express signed december  provided for a payment to us of million for certain expenses related to marketing costs we incurred through may and transition costs 
we had thousand of deferred marketing expenses as of december  which was offset by the million payment between january  and may  the remaining balance of thousand was recorded to other income in may commission expenses 
commission expenses consist of commissions paid to clients 
commission expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease is related to the loss of american express partially offset by the additional commissions related to insurance and marketing products as the result of the acquisition of chartered marketing services 
as a percentage of revenue  commission expenses decreased to for year ended december  from for year ended december  primarily as the result of the loss of american express 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists of the costs of operating our customer service and information processing centers  data costs  costs to provide background screening and billing costs for subscribers and one time transactional sales 
cost of revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributed to an million increase in consumer products and services and a million increase in background screening 
the increase in consumer products and services is primarily the result of a increase in our subscriber base 
the growth in our subscriber base has been accomplished primarily through continued marketing efforts with new and existing clients and the addition of insurance and other products and services to our client based business as a result of the acquisition of chartered marketing services 
the increase in background screening is primarily a result of the addition of the uk operations in june and an increase in our domestic background screening volume 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist of personnel and facilities expenses associated with our executive  sales  marketing  information technology  finance  and program and account management functions 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributed to a million increase in consumer products and services and a million increase in background screening 
contributing to the increase in consumer products and services were increases in payroll  stock based compensation  severance and professional services  costs related to additional insurance and membership products to our client based business as a result of the acquisition of charted marketing services  as well as various overhead expenses as a result of our growth and being a public company 
during the year ended december  we terminated several executives  which resulted in severance expense of approximately million  of which thousand was paid in in addition  we recorded million for stock based compensation expense and thousand related to outside organizational consulting services 
in addition we incurred approximately thousand for termination fees in connection with our terminating a letter of intent to acquire a company 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in background screening is primarily a result of the addition of the uk operations in june and an increase in our domestic background screening volume 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses consist primarily of depreciation expenses related to our fixed assets and capitalized software  and the amortization of our intangible assets 
depreciation and amortization increased to million in from million in primarily as a result of capital expenditures totaling million and million in and  as we continue to expand our infrastructure to meet our growth 
as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization expenses increased to in from in amortization of intangible assets increased million due to assets acquired in capital expenditures for the consumer products and services business are expected to reduce as we move forward  which will improve profitability 
the background screening business will be increasing infrastructure in to which both operational and capital expenses will increase as we expand overseas 
impairment of software development costs 
during the year ended december   we re assessed the development effort related to our small business product in an effort to launch the product sooner and with less additional investment 
consequently  we decided to adopt an alternative approach resulting in the recognition of an impairment loss of approximately million related to software development costs 
in addition  we entered into a new agreement with a client that required an investment in new software resulting in an additional impairment loss of approximately thousand in the first quarter of interest income and expense 
interest income and expense consists of interest earned on cash equivalents and investments offset by accrued interest expense on equipment leases and interest expense related to our term loan 
net interest income decreased to thousand for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease is largely attributable to an increase in interest expense related to the term loan  while interest income increased thousand due to increases in the average interest rate of our investments 
provision for income taxes

total revenue increased by to million in from million in revenue was reduced in by approximately due to our new marketing and services agreement with capital one that became effective on september  prior to the new agreement  revenue was recognized on a gross basis in the amount billed to the subscriber because we served as the primary obligor in the transaction  had latitude in establishing price and bore the physical loss of inventory and credit risk for the amount billed to the subscriber 
under the new agreement  the client serves as the primary obligor  has latitude in establishing price and bears the credit risk for the amount billed to the subscriber 
as a result  pursuant to the new agreement  we record revenue based on the amount billed to the client not the amount billed to the subscriber 
these revised terms and the corresponding change in revenue recognition for this new agreement will impact our expenses as a percentage of revenue 
marketing and commission expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenue while cost of revenue  general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expense will increase as a percentage of revenue 
despite this change  revenue continued to increase due to an increase in subscribers 
our subscription base increased to million subscribers as of december  from million subscribers as of december   an increase of 
the growth in our subscriber base has been accomplished primarily through continued marketing efforts with existing clients 
as shown in the table below  an increasing percentage of our subscribers and revenue is generated from indirect marketing arrangements 
december  percentage of subscribers from indirect marketing arrangements to total subscribers as of december  percentage of revenue from indirect marketing arrangements to total subscription revenue for the year ended under a master agreement with equifax consumer services  a subsidiary of equifax  we were providing to customers of equifax through electronic delivery a one time  non subscription report with data from equifax  experian and transunion  which equifax consumer services then marketed online 
this one time report service was terminated by equifax consumer services effective october  when equifax consumer services began to provide this service directly to consumers 
the one time report service is not the same as our credit monitoring service  which monitors the credit files of subscribers at one or all three major credit reporting agencies on an ongoing subscription basis 
as a result  revenue generated from these sales decreased from million in to no revenue in marketing expenses 
marketing expenses consist of subscriber acquisition costs  including telemarketing  web based marketing and direct mail expenses such as printing and postage 
marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase is due to the net effect of two of our clients shifting from a direct marketing arrangement to an indirect marketing arrangement and an increase in marketing associated with two clients under direct arrangements
