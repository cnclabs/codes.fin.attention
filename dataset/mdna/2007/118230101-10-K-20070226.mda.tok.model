the partnership s principal line of business is the transportation  terminalling and storage of petroleum products in the united states for major integrated oil companies  large refined petroleum product marketing companies and major end users of petroleum products on a fee basis through facilities owned and operated by the partnership 
the partnership also operates pipelines owned by third parties under contracts with major integrated oil and chemical companies  and performs certain construction activities  generally for the owners of those third party pipelines 
the partnership s direct subsidiaries are buckeye pipe line company  lp buckeye  laurel pipe line company  lp laurel  everglades pipe line company  lp everglades  buckeye pipe line holdings  lp bph  wood river pipe lines llc wood river  buckeye pipe line transportation llc bpl transportation and buckeye ngl pipe lines llc buckeye ngl 
each of these entities is referred to as an operating subsidiary and they are collectively referred to as the operating subsidiaries 
the partnership owns an approximately interest in each operating subsidiary except that it owns a interest in each of wood river  bpl transportation and buckeye ngl 
the partnership s pipeline system and terminals generate a substantial portion of the partnership s cash flows 
the revenues generated by the partnership s businesses are significantly influenced by demand for refined petroleum products 
operating expenses are principally fixed costs related to routine maintenance and system integrity as well as field and support personnel 
other costs  including power  fluctuate with volumes transported in the partnership s pipelines or stored in its terminals 
expenses resulting from environmental remediation projects have historically included costs from projects relating both to current and past events 
for further discussion of environmental matters  see business environmental regulation under item of this annual report on form k 
strategic actions the partnership s primary business strategies are to generate stable cash flows  increase pipeline and terminal throughput and pursue strategic cash flow accretive acquisitions that complement the partnership s existing asset base  improve operating efficiencies  and allow increased cash distributions to unitholders 
in the years  and  the partnership significantly expanded its operations through the following asset acquisitions on october   the partnership acquired five refined petroleum products pipelines with an aggregate mileage of approximately miles and refined products terminals with an aggregate storage capacity of million barrels the midwest pipelines and terminals from shell oil products us shell for a purchase price of million 
in may  the partnership acquired a refined petroleum products pipeline system comprising approximately miles of pipeline and four refined products terminals with aggregate storage capacity of approximately million barrels located principally in the northeastern united states the northeast pipelines and terminals from affiliates of exxonmobil corporation exxonmobil for a purchase price of million 
in december  the partnership acquired a mile pipeline and a interest in a joint venture company that owns another refined petroleum products pipeline and terminal in the midwestern united states 
it also acquired a refined petroleum products terminal and related assets including certain railroad offloading facilities located in taylor  michigan for a purchase price of million

on january   the partnership acquired a natural gas liquids pipeline the ngl pipeline with aggregate mileage of approximately miles from bp pipelines north america inc for approximately million  including a deposit of million paid in december the ngl pipeline extends generally from wattenberg  colorado to bushton  kansas 
the acquired assets have been included in the partnership s operations from their dates of acquisition 
operating segments the partnership has determined that its operations are appropriately presented in three operating segments pipeline operations  terminalling and storage  and other operations 
pipeline operations the pipeline operations segment receives petroleum products including gasoline  jet fuel  diesel fuel and other distillates and natural gas liquids from refineries  connecting pipelines and bulk and marine terminals and transports those products to other locations by pipeline for a fee 
as of december   this segment owned and operated approximately  miles of pipelines in the following states california  colorado  connecticut  florida  illinois  indiana  kansas  massachusetts  michigan  missouri  new jersey  nevada  new york  ohio  pennsylvania and tennessee 
terminalling and storage the terminalling and storage segment provides bulk storage and terminal throughput services 
this segment consists of active terminals that have the capacity to store an aggregate of approximately million barrels of refined petroleum products 
the terminals are located in illinois  indiana  massachusetts  michigan  missouri  new york  ohio and pennsylvania 
other operations the other operations segment consists primarily of the partnership s operation of third party pipelines owned principally by major petrochemical companies pursuant to operations and maintenance contracts 
the third party pipelines are located primarily in texas 
this segment also includes the provision by the partnership  through its buckeye gulf coast subsidiary  of pipeline construction management services  typically on a cost plus a fixed fee basis 
the other operations segment also includes the partnership s ownership and operation of an ammonia pipeline acquired in november  and its majority ownership of a crude butadiene pipeline located in texas 
results of operations summary summary operating results for the partnership were as follows year ended december  in thousands  except per unit amounts revenue costs and expenses operating income other income expenses net income allocation of net income net income allocated to general partner net income allocated to limited partners earnings per limited partner unit basic earnings per limited partner unit diluted weighted average number of limited partner units outstanding basic diluted the improvement in revenues  operating income and net income in compared to  and compared to  is generally due to the expansion of the partnership s operations through acquisitions  internal growth projects  and increases in interstate pipeline tariff rates and terminalling throughput fees 
the partnership s net income in reflects an amendment of the partnership s incentive compensation agreement and partnership agreement between the general partner and the partnership which changed the incentive compensation paid to the general partner from a compensation payment to a partnership distribution as described in note to the partnership s financial statements 
these amendments affected the partnership s results of operations commencing in the fourth quarter of accordingly  net income for was million higher than it would have been if the partnership agreement had not been amended 
earnings per limited partner unit as shown above were impacted by the issuance of million lp units in march  million lp units in may  million lp units in february and million lp units in october ebitda and adjusted ebitda the following table summarizes ebitda and adjusted ebitda for the partnership for the years ended december   and ebitda  a measure not defined under generally accepted accounting principles gaap is defined by the partnership as income before interest expense including amortization and write off of deferred debt financing costs  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda  also a non gaap measure  is defined as ebitda plus the general partner incentive compensation expense 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income  operating profit  cash flow from operations or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap 
because ebitda and adjusted ebitda exclude some items that affect net income and these items may vary among other companies  the ebitda and adjusted ebitda data presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies 
the partnership has provided adjusted ebitda in addition to ebitda because  commencing in the fourth quarter of  the partnership reports incentive payments to the general partner as equity distributions  rather than incentive compensation expense as reported in periods prior to the fourth quarter of see note to the partnership s consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of this change 
accordingly  the general partner incentive compensation presented below includes only three quarters of incentive payments and does not include the million incentive payment paid in the fourth quarter of future periods will not reflect general partner incentive payments as a component of net income 
management of the partnership uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda as performance measures to assist in the analysis and assessment of the partnership s operations  to evaluate the viability of proposed projects and to determine overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 
the partnership believes that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures used by the partnership s management
