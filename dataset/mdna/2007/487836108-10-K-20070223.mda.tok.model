item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations kellogg company and subsidiaries results of operations overview kellogg company is the world s leading producer of cereal and a leading producer of convenience foods  including cookies  crackers  toaster pastries  cereal bars  fruit snacks  frozen waffles  and veggie foods 
kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally 
we currently manage our operations in four geographic operating segments  comprised of north america and the three international operating segments of europe  latin america  and asia pacific 
for the periods presented  the asia pacific operating segment included australia and asian markets 
beginning in  this segment will also include south africa  which was formerly a part of europe 
we manage our company for sustainable performance defined by our long term annual growth targets 
during the periods presented  these targets were low single digit for internal net sales  mid single digit for internal operating profit  and high single digit for net earnings per share  which we met or exceeded in each of   and consolidated results dollars in millions net sales net sales growth as reported internal a operating profit operating profit growth as reported b

in combination with an attractive dividend yield  we believe this profitable growth has and will continue to provide a strong total return to our shareholders 
we plan to continue to achieve this sustainability through a strategy focused on growing our cereal business  expanding our snacks business  and pursuing selected growth opportunities 
we support our business strategy with operating principles that emphasize profit rich  sustainable sales growth  as well as cash flow and return on invested capital 
we believe our steady earnings growth  strong cash flow  and continued investment during a multi year period of significant commodity and energy driven cost inflation demonstrates the strength and flexibility of our business model

internal net sales also grew  building on a rate of internal growth during successful innovation  brand building advertising and consumer promotion investment  and in store execution continued to drive broad based sales growth across each 
table of contents of our enterprise wide product groups 
in fact  we achieved growth in retail cereal sales within each of our operating segments 
for  our north america operating segment reported a net sales increase of 
internal net sales growth was also  with each major product group contributing as follows retail cereal  retail snacks cookies  crackers  toaster pastries  cereal bars  fruit snacks  frozen and specialty food service  vending  convenience  drug stores  custom manufacturing channels 
the significant growth achieved by our north america snacks business represented nearly one half of the total dollar increase in consolidated internal net sales for the growth in north america retail cereal sales was on top of growth in and represented the th consecutive year in which we ve increased our dollar share of category sales 
although north america consumer retail cereal consumption remained steady throughout  our shipment revenues declined in the fourth quarter of by approximately versus the prior year period 
we believe this decline was largely attributable to year end retail trade inventory adjustments  which brought inventories in line with year end levels after several successive quarters of slight inclines 
our international operating segments collectively achieved net sales growth of approximately or on an internal basis  with leading dollar contributions from our uk  france  mexico  and venezuela business units 
internal sales of our asia pacific operating segment which represents less than of our consolidated results were approximately even with the prior year  as solid growth in australia cereal and asian markets was offset by weak performance in our australia snack business 
consolidated operating profit for grew  with internal operating profit up versus as discussed on page  our measure of internal operating profit growth is consistent with our measure of internal sales growth  except that during  internal operating profit growth also excluded the impact of incremental stock compensation expense associated with our adoption of sfas no 
r 
we used this non gaap financial measure during our first year of adopting this fasb standard in order to assist management and investors in assessing the company s financial operating performance against comparative periods  which did not include stock option related compensation expense 
accordingly  corporate selling  general  and administrative sga expense was higher and operating profit was lower by million for  reducing consolidated operating profit growth by approximately four percentage points 
refer to the section beginning on page entitled stock compensation for further information on the company s adoption of sfas no

as further discussed beginning on page  our measure of internal operating profit growth includes up front costs related to cost reduction initiatives 
although total up front costs of million were not significantly changed from the amount of million  a year over year shift in operating segment allocation of such costs affected relative segment performance 
the versus change in project cost allocation was a million decline in north america improving segment operating profit performance by approximately and a million increase in europe reducing segment operating profit performance by approximately 
our current year operating profit growth was affected by significant cost pressures as discussed in the margin performance section beginning on page expenditures for brand building activities increased at a low single digit rate  this rate of growth incorporates savings reinvestment from our recent focus on media buying efficiencies and global leverage of promotional campaigns 
within our total brand building metric  advertising expenditures grew at a high single digit rate for  which is a dynamic that we expect to continue through due to a relatively heavier focus on promotional efficiencies 
consistent with our long term commitment  we expect to return to higher rates of growth for total brand building expenditures  beginning in compared to the following tables provide an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for versus asia north latin pacific consoli dollars in millions america europe america a corporate dated net sales net sales change vs

during  consolidated net sales increased nearly 
internal net sales also grew approximately  which was on top of internal sales growth in for  successful innovation and brand building investment drove strong growth across our north american business units  which collectively reported a increase in net sales versus internal net sales of our north america retail cereal business increased  with strong performance in both the united states and canada 
internal net sales of our north america retail snacks business increased on top of growth in this growth was attributable principally to sales of fruit snacks  toaster pastries  cracker products  and major cookie brands 
partially offsetting this growth was the impact of proactively managing discontinuation of marginal cookie innovations 
internal net sales of our north america frozen and specialty channel businesses collectively increased approximately  led by solid contributions from our eggo frozen foods and food service businesses 
in  our international operating segments collectively achieved net sales growth of nearly on both a reported and internal basis  with our latin america operating segment contributing approximately two thirds of the total dollar increase 
nevertheless  we achieved our long term annual growth targets of low single digit for internal net sales in our europe and asia pacific operating segments due primarily to solid innovation performance in southern europe and asia 
consolidated operating profit increased during  with our europe operating segment contributing approximately one half of the total dollar increase 
this disproportionate contribution was attributable to a year over year shift in segment allocation of charges from cost reduction initiatives 
as discussed in the section beginning on page  the versus change in project cost allocation was a million decline in europe improving segment operating profit performance by approximately and a million increase in north america reducing segment operating profit performance by approximately 
internal growth in consolidated operating profit was 
this internal growth was achieved despite double digit growth in brand building and innovation expenditures and significant cost pressures on gross margin  as discussed in the following section 
during  we increased our consolidated brand building advertising and consumer promotion expenditures by more than times the rate of sales growth 
corporate operating profit for included a charge of million related to ceo transition expenses  which arose from the departure of carlos gutierrez  the company s former ceo  related to his appointment as us secretary of commerce in early the total charge net of forfeitures of million was comprised principally of million for special pension termination benefits and million for accelerated vesting of  stock options 
segment operating profit for included intangibles impairment losses of million  comprised of million to write off the carrying value of a contract based intangible asset in north america and million to write off goodwill in latin america 
margin performance margin performance is presented in the following table 
change vs 
prior year pts 
gross margin sga a operating margin a selling  general  and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales 
we strive for gross margin expansion to reinvest in brand building and innovation expenditures 
our strategy for expanding our gross margin is to manage external cost pressures through product pricing and mix improvements  productivity savings  and technological initiatives to reduce the cost of product ingredients and packaging 
our gross margin performance for and reflects the impact of significant fuel  energy  and commodity price inflation experienced throughout most of that time  as well as increased employee benefit costs 
in the aggregate  these input cost pressures reduced our consolidated gross margin by approximately basis points for and basis points in for  our gross margin performance was also unfavorably impacted by incremental logistics and 
table of contents innovation start up costs related to the recent  significant sales growth within our north america operating segment 
while the majority of the inflationary pressure during and was commodity and energy driven  employee benefit costs the majority of which are recorded in cost of goods sold also increased during that time period  with total active and retired employee benefits expense reaching approximately million in versus million in and million in for  the combined effect of favorable trust asset performance and rising interest rates is expected to have a moderating effect on underlying health care cost inflation 
as a result  we expect benefits expense to be approximately even with the amount 
for  we expect this inflationary trend to continue  with input cost fuel  energy  commodity  and benefits pressures forecasted to exceed realized savings 
as compared to results  we currently expect million of incremental cost inflation  primarily associated with the prices of our ingredient purchases 
accordingly  we believe our consolidated gross margin could decline by up to basis points 
in addition to external cost pressures  our discretionary investment in cost reduction initiatives refer to following section has created variability in our gross margin performance during the periods presented 
although total annual program related charges were relatively steady over the past several years  the amount recorded in cost of goods sold varied by year in millions   additionally  cost of goods sold for includes a charge of approximately million  related to a lump sum payment to members of the major union representing the hourly employees at our us cereal plants for ratification of a wage and benefits agreement with the company covering the four year period ended october for  both our sga and operating margin were affected by our fiscal adoption of sfas no 
r 
during  we reported incremental stock compensation expense of million  which increased our sga and reduced our operating margin by approximately basis points 
refer to the section beginning on page entitled stock compensation for further information on this subject 
cost reduction initiatives we view our continued spending on cost reduction initiatives as part of our ongoing operating principles to reinvest earnings so as to provide greater reliability in meeting long term growth targets 
initiatives undertaken must meet certain pay back and internal rate of return irr targets 
we currently require each project to recover total cash implementation costs within a five year period of completion or to achieve an irr of at least 
each cost reduction initiative is normally one to three years in duration 
upon completion or as each major stage is completed in the case of multi year programs  the project begins to deliver cash savings and or reduced depreciation  which is then used to fund new initiatives 
to implement these programs  the company has incurred various up front costs  including asset write offs  exit charges  and other project expenditures  which we include in our measure and discussion of operating segment profitability within the net sales and operating profit section beginning on page in  we commenced a multi year european manufacturing optimization plan to improve utilization of our facility in manchester  england and to better align production in europe 
based on forecasted foreign exchange rates  the company currently expects to incur approximately million in total up front costs including those already incurred in  comprised of approximately cash and non cash asset write offs  to complete this initiative 
the cash portion of the total up front costs results principally from our plan to eliminate approximately hourly and salaried positions from the manchester facility by the end of through voluntary early retirement and severance programs 
for  we incurred approximately million of total up front costs and expect to incur a similar amount in  leaving a relatively insignificant amount to be incurred in cash requirements for this initiative are expected to exceed projected cash charges by approximately million in total due to incremental pension trust funding requirements of early retirements  most of this incremental funding occurred in also during  we implemented several short term initiatives to enhance the productivity and efficiency of our us cereal manufacturing network and streamlined our sales distribution system in a latin american market 
in  we undertook an initiative to consolidate us snacks bakery capacity  resulting in the closure and sale of two facilities by mid major initiatives commenced in were the global rollout of the sap information technology system  reorganization of pan european operations  consolidation of us veggie foods manufacturing operations  and relocation of our us snacks business unit to battle creek  michigan 
except for the aforementioned european manufacturing optimization plan  our other initiatives were substantially complete at december  details of each initiative are described in note within notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents for  the company recorded total program related charges of approximately million  comprised of million of asset write offs  million for severance and other exit costs  million for other cash expenditures  million for a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability  and million for pension and other postretirement plan curtailment losses and special termination benefits 
approximately million of the total charges were recorded in cost of goods sold within operating segment results  with approximately million recorded in sga expense within corporate results 
the company s operating segments were impacted as follows in millions north america  europe for  total program related charges were approximately million  comprised of million for a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability  million of asset write offs  million in severance and other exit costs  and million for other cash expenditures 
all of the charges were recorded in cost of goods sold within our north america operating segment 
for  total program related charges were approximately million  comprised of million in asset write offs  million for special pension termination benefits  million in severance and other exit costs  and million in other cash expenditures such as relocation and consulting 
approximately million of the total charges were recorded in cost of goods sold  with approximately million recorded in sga expense 
the charges impacted our operating segments as follows in millions north america  europe for the periods presented  cash requirements to implement these programs approximated the exit costs and other cash charges incurred in each year  except for approximately million of incremental pension trust funding that occurred in in connection with the european manufacturing optimization plan 
at december   the company s remaining cash commitments to complete the executed programs were comprised of exit cost reserves of million expected to be paid out in  approximately million of projected spending and pension trust funding during and associated with the european manufacturing optimization plan  and an estimated multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability of million  which will not be finally determined until and once determined  is payable to the pension fund over a year maximum period 
we expect these cash requirements to be funded by operating cash flow 
our earnings target includes total projected charges related to in progress and potential cost reduction initiatives of approximately million or 
per share 
approximately one third of this total is allocated to the european manufacturing optimization plan 
however  the specific cash versus non cash mix or cost of goods sold versus sga expense impact of the remainder has not yet been determined 
other potential initiatives to be commenced in are still in the planning stages and individual actions will be announced as we commit to these discretionary investments 
interest expense as illustrated in the following table  annual interest expense for the period has been relatively steady at approximately million per year  which reflects a stable effective interest rate on total debt and a relatively constant debt balance throughout most of that time 
interest income recorded in other income has trended upward from approximately million in to million in  resulting in net interest expense of approximately million for we currently expect that our net interest expense will approximate the level

other income expense  net other income expense  net includes non operating items such as interest income  charitable donations  and foreign exchange gains and losses 
other income expense  net for the periods presented was in millions   
the variability in other income expense  net  among years reflects the timing of certain significant charges explained in the following paragraph and net foreign exchange transaction losses included therein of in millions other expense includes charges for contributions to the kellogg s corporate citizenship fund  a private trust established for charitable giving  as follows in millions   other expense for also includes a charge of approximately million to reduce the carrying value of a corporate commercial facility to estimated selling value 
this facility was sold in august 
table of contents income taxes our long term objective is to achieve a consolidated effective income tax rate of approximately 
in comparison to a us federal statutory income tax rate of  we pursue planning initiatives globally in order to move toward our long term target 
excluding the impact of discrete adjustments  our sustainable consolidated effective income tax rate for both and was approximately  which is what we currently expect for our reported rates of approximately for and for were lower due to the favorable effect of various discrete adjustments such as audit settlements  statutory rate changes  and other deferred tax liability adjustments 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
similarly  our consolidated effective income tax rate could be up to basis points lower than the aforementioned sustainable rate if pending uncertain tax matters  including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives  are resolved more favorably than we currently expect 
we expect that any incremental benefits from such discrete events would be invested in cost reduction initiatives and other growth opportunities 
the consolidated effective income tax rate for of nearly was higher than the rates for and primarily because this period preceded the final reorganization of our european operations which favorably affected the country weighting impact on our rate 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on this initiative 
additionally  the consolidated effective income tax rate included a provision of approximately million net of related foreign tax credits for approximately billion of dividends from foreign subsidiaries which we elected to repatriate in under the american jobs creation act 
finally  was the first year in which we were permitted to claim a phased in deduction from us taxable income equal to a stipulated percentage of qualified production income qpi 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows  supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions 
this cash generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs 
the principal source of our operating cash flow is net earnings  meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products  net of costs to manufacture and market our products 
our cash conversion cycle is relatively short  although receivable collection patterns vary around the world  in the united states  our days sales outstanding dso averaged approximately days during the periods presented 
as a result  our operating cash flow should generally reflect our net earnings performance over time  although  as illustrated in the following schedule  specific results for any particular year may be significantly affected by the level of benefit plan contributions  working capital movements operating assets and liabilities and other factors 
dollars in millions operating activities net earnings year over year change items in net earnings not requiring providing cash depreciation and amortization deferred income taxes other a net earnings after non cash items year over year change pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions changes in operating assets and liabilities core working capital b other working capital total net cash provided by operating activities year over year change a consists principally of non cash expense accruals for employee compensation and benefit obligations 
b inventory and trade receivables less trade payables 
our operating cash flow for was approximately million higher than  due primarily to lower benefit plan contributions  partially offset by unfavorable working capital movements 
correspondingly  operating cash flow for was approximately million lower than  due principally to a significant increase in benefit plan contributions 
the decline in benefit plan contributions for reflects the improved funded position of our major benefit plans that was achieved through a significant amount of funding in the period 
on august   the pension protection act ppa became law in the united states 
the ppa revised the basis and methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits paid from tax qualified plans 
most of these provisions are first applicable to our us defined benefit pension plans in on a phased in basis 
the ppa will ultimately require us to make additional contributions to our us plans 
however  due to our historical 
table of contents funding practices  we currently believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under the new ppa requirements until after accordingly  we do not expect to have significant statutory or contractual funding requirements for our major retiree benefit plans during the next several years  with total us and foreign plan contributions currently estimated at approximately million 
actual contributions could exceed our current projections  as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities  future changes in government requirements  renewals of union contracts  or higher than expected health care claims experience 
additionally  our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 
in comparison to  the unfavorable movement in core working capital during was related to trade payables performance and higher inventory balances 
at december   our consolidated trade payables balance was within of the balance at year end in contrast  our trade payables balance increased approximately during  from a historically low level at the end of the higher inventory balance was principally related to higher commodity prices for our raw material and packaging inventories and to a lesser extent  the overall increase in the average number of weeks of inventory on hand 
our consolidated inventory balances were unfavorably affected by us capacity limitations during  nevertheless  our consolidated inventory balances remain at industry leading levels 
despite the unfavorable movement in the absolute balance  average core working capital continues to improve as a percentage of net sales 
for the trailing fifty two weeks ended december   core working capital was of net sales  as compared to as of year end and as of year end we have achieved this multi year reduction primarily through faster collection of accounts receivable and extension of terms on trade payables 
up until  we had also been successful in implementing logistics improvements to reduce inventory on hand while continuing to meet customer requirements 
we believe the opportunity to reduce inventory from year end levels could represent a source of operating cash flow during for  the net favorable movement in core working capital was related to the aforementioned increase in trade payables  partially offset by an unfavorable movement in trade receivables  which returned to historical levels in relation to sales in early from lower levels at the end of we believe these lower levels were related to the timing of our rd week over the holiday period  which impacted the core working capital component of our operating cash flow throughout as presented in the table on page  other working capital was a source of cash in versus a use of cash in the year over year favorable variance of approximately million was attributable to several factors including lower debt related currency swap payments in as well as business related growth in accrued compensation and promotional liabilities 
the unfavorable movement in other working capital for  as compared to succeeding years  primarily relates to a decrease in current income tax liabilities which is offset in the deferred income taxes line item 
our management measure of cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions 
we use this non gaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment  dividend distributions  acquisition opportunities  and share repurchase 
our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure  as follows dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities additions to properties cash flow year over year change our and cash flow as defined performance reflects increased spending for selected capacity expansions to accommodate our company s strong sales growth over the past several years 
this increased capital spending represented of net sales in and of net sales in  as compared to in for  we currently expect property expenditures to remain at approximately of net sales  which is consistent with our long term target for capital spending 
this forecast includes expenditures associated with the construction of a new manufacturing facility in ontario  canada  which represents approximately of our capital plan 
this facility is being constructed to satisfy existing capacity needs in our north america business  which we believe will partially ease certain of the aforementioned logistics and inventory management issues which we encountered during for  we are targeting cash flow of  million 
we expect to achieve our target principally through operating 
table of contents profit growth  which is forecasted to offset higher levels of capital spending and income tax payments during in order to support the continued growth of our north american fruit snacks business  we completed two separate business acquisitions during for a total of approximately million in cash  including related transaction costs 
in june  we acquired a fruit snacks manufacturing facility and related assets from kraft foods inc the facility is located in chicago  illinois and employs approximately active hourly and salaried employees 
in november  we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of a washington state based manufacturer of natural and organic fruit snacks 
for  our board of directors authorized stock repurchases for general corporate purposes and to offset issuances for employee benefit programs of up to million  which we spent to repurchase approximately million shares 
this activity consisted principally of a february private transaction with the wk kellogg foundation trust the trust to repurchase approximately million shares for million 
pursuant to similar board authorizations applicable to those years  we paid million in to repurchase approximately million shares and million in for approximately million shares 
the activity consisted principally of a november private transaction with the trust to repurchase approximately million shares for million 
for  our board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million 
in july  we redeemed million of long term debt  representing the remaining principal balance of our us dollar notes due april in october  we repaid million of maturing us dollar notes 
in december  we redeemed million of us dollar notes due june these payments were funded principally through issuance of us dollar short term debt 
during november  subsidiaries of the company issued approximately million of foreign currency denominated debt in offerings outside of the united states  consisting of euro million of floating rate notes due the euro notes and approximately c million of canadian commercial paper 
these debt issuances were guaranteed by the company and net proceeds were used primarily for the payment of dividends pursuant to the american jobs creation act and the purchase of stock and assets of other direct or indirect subsidiaries of the company  as well as for general corporate purposes 
to utilize excess cash and reduce financing costs  on january   we announced an early redemption of the euro notes  effective february  to partially refinance this redemption  we established a program to issue euro commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of million or its equivalent in alternative currencies 
the notes may have maturities ranging up to days and will be senior unsecured obligations of the applicable issuer  with subsidiary issuances guaranteed by the company 
in connection with these financing activities  we increased our short term lines of credit from billion at december  to approximately billion  via a million unsecured day credit agreement effective january  the day agreement contains customary covenants  warranties  and restrictions similar to those applicable to our existing billion five year credit agreement  which expires in these facilities are available for general corporate purposes  including commercial paper back up  although the company does not currently anticipate any usage under the facilities 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our debt issuances and credit facilities 
at december   our total debt was approximately billion  approximately even with the balances at year end and during  we increased our benefit trust investments through plan funding by approximately  reduced the company s common stock outstanding through repurchase programs by approximately  and implemented a mid year increase in the shareholder dividend level of approximately 
similarly  during  we further reduced our common stock outstanding through repurchase programs by approximately and implemented a mid year increase in the shareholder dividend level of approximately 
primarily due to the prioritization of these uses of cash flow  plus the aforementioned need to selectively invest in production capacity  we did not reduce our total debt balance during the past two years  but remain committed to net debt reduction total debt less cash over the long term 
we currently expect the total debt balance at year end to be slightly higher than the year end level 
we believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future  while still meeting our operational needs  including the pursuit of selected growth opportunities  through our strong cash flow  our program of issuing short term debt  and maintaining credit facilities on a global basis 
our significant long term debt issues do not 
table of contents contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings 
a change in the company s credit ratings could limit its access to the us short term debt market and or increase the cost of refinancing long term debt in the future 
however  even under these circumstances  we would continue to have access to our credit facilities  which are in amounts sufficient to cover our outstanding commercial paper balance  which was billion at december  in addition  assuming continuation of market liquidity  we believe it would be possible to term out certain short term maturities or obtain additional credit facilities such that the company could further extend its ability to meet its long term borrowing obligations through off balance sheet arrangements and other obligations off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to a residual value guarantee on one operating lease of approximately million  which will expire in july  and guarantees on loans to independent contractors for their purchase of dsd route franchises up to million 
we record the estimated fair value of these loan guarantees on our balance sheet  which was insignificant for the periods presented 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes future estimated cash payments to be made under existing contractual obligations 
further information on debt obligations is contained in note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
further information on lease obligations is contained in note contractual obligations payments due by period and millions total beyond long term debt principal interest a capital leases operating leases purchase obligations b other long term c total a includes interest payments on long term fixed rate debt 
as of december   the company did not have any long term variable rate debt or any outstanding interest rate derivative financial instruments 
b purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments under various co marketing agreements and to a lesser extent  of service agreements  and contracts for future delivery of commodities  packaging materials  and equipment 
the amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or other current liabilities at year end  nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans  but are not obligated to incur 
therefore  it should be noted that the exclusion of these items from the table could be a limitation in assessing our total future cash flows under contracts 
c other long term contractual obligations are those associated with noncurrent liabilities recorded within the consolidated balance sheet at year end and consist principally of projected commitments under deferred compensation arrangements  multiemployer plans  and supplemental employee retirement benefits 
the table also includes our current estimate of minimum contributions to defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans through as follows  critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are discussed in note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
during  we adopted two new accounting pronouncements which had a significant impact on our company s financial statements 
at the beginning of  we adopted sfas no 
r share based payment  which materially reduced our fiscal results  due primarily to the first time recognition of compensation expense associated with employee and director stock option grants 
this topic is further discussed in the section beginning on page secondly  at the end of  we adopted sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  which required us to reflect the net over or under funded position of our defined postretirement and postemployment benefit plans as an asset or liability on the balance sheet  with unrecognized prior service cost and net experience losses recorded in shareholders equity 
under pre existing guidance  these unrecognized amounts  which totaled approximately million at december   were disclosed only in financial statement footnotes 
accordingly  the after tax presentation of these amounts on the balance sheet reduced consolidated net assets and shareholders equity by million at year end nevertheless  we do not believe this impact is economically significant because our net earnings  cash flow  liquidity  debt covenants  and plan funding requirements were not affected by this change in accounting principle 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on sfas no 
refer to the section beginning on page for information on our process for estimating benefit obligations 
at the beginning of our fiscal year  we adopted fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income 
table of contents taxes fin no 
 which affects our process for estimating tax benefits and liabilities  as further discussed in the income taxes section beginning on page the initial application of fin no 
resulted in a net decrease to accrued income tax and related interest liabilities of approximately million  with an offsetting increase to retained earnings 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on fin no 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
fair value measurements to provide enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the standard also expands disclosure requirements for assets and liabilities measured at fair value  how fair value is determined  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
the standard applies whenever other authoritative literature requires or permits certain assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  but does not expand the use of fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those years 
early adoption is permitted 
we plan to adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of our fiscal year 
for the company  balance sheet items carried at fair value consist primarily of derivatives and other financial instruments  assets held for sale  exit liabilities  and the trust asset component of net benefit plan obligations 
relevant to the intangibles section beginning on this page  we also use fair value concepts to test various long lived assets for impairment and to initially measure assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on how these assets and liabilities are currently measured 
our critical accounting estimates  which require significant judgments and assumptions likely to have a material impact on our financial statements  are discussed in the following sections on pages promotional expenditures our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and involve in store displays and events  feature price discounts on our products  consumer coupons  contests  and loyalty programs  and similar activities 
the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded  which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure 
the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer 
these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs 
differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period 
on a full year basis  these subsequent period adjustments have rarely represented in excess of 

of our company s net sales 
however  as our company s total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a revenue reduction represented nearly of net sales  the likelihood exists of materially different reported results if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 
intangibles we follow sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets in evaluating impairment of intangibles 
we perform this evaluation at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill 
carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit  which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units 
the fair value of a reporting unit is based primarily on our assessment of profitability multiples likely to be achieved in a theoretical sale transaction 
similarly  impairment testing of other intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset 
fair values of non goodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset 
for instance  cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales 
these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data  current and anticipated market conditions  management plans  and market comparables 
we periodically engage third party valuation consultants to assist in this process 
we also follow sfas no 
in evaluating the useful life over which a non goodwill intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of the company 
an intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortized  an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized  but is evaluated annually for impairment 
reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  other economic factors such as the stability of the industry  known technological advances  legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment  and expected changes in 
table of contents distribution channels  the level of required maintenance expenditures  and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 
at december   intangible assets  net  were billion  consisting primarily of goodwill and trademarks associated with the acquisition of keebler foods company 
within this total  approximately billion of non goodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinite lived  comprised principally of keebler trademarks 
while we currently believe that the fair value of all of our intangibles exceeds carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to the cash flows of the company  materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our north american snacks business or the weighted average cost of capital used in the valuations could result in significant impairment losses and or amortization expense 
stock compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r share based payment  which generally requires public companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value and to recognize this cost over the requisite service period 
we adopted sfas no 
r as of the beginning of our fiscal year  using the modified prospective method 
accordingly  prior years were not restated  but our results include compensation expense associated with unvested equity based awards  which were granted prior to with the adoption of this pronouncement  stock based compensation represents a critical accounting policy of the company  which is further described in note within notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for  our adoption of sfas no 
r has resulted in an increase in the company s corporate sga expense and a corresponding reduction to earnings and net earnings per share  due primarily to recognition of compensation expense associated with employee and director stock option grants 
no such expense was recognized under our previous accounting method in pre periods  however  we were required to disclose pro forma results under the alternate fair value method prescribed by sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
using reported results for and pro forma results for  the comparable impact of stock compensation expense is presented in the following table stock based compensation expense diluted eps millions  except per share data pre tax net of tax impact as reported comparable sfas no 
r adoption impact as reported total as reported comparable pro forma incremental pro forma total as illustrated in the preceding table  the pro forma incremental impact of stock compensation was 
per share for versus an 
impact of adopting sfas no 
r in the 
year over year increase in the per share impact is due principally to an increase in the number of options granted during and a lower average number of shares outstanding on which the calculation is based 
as explained in the following paragraphs  the amount of stock compensation recognized for any particular year is highly dependent on market conditions and other factors outside of our control 
based on historical patterns and predicted market conditions existing at december   we currently expect the earnings per share impact of stock option expense to be within the range of actual and results 
accounting for stock compensation under sfas no 
r represents a critical accounting estimate  which requires significant judgments and assumptions likely to have a material impact on our financial statements 
due to the need to determine the grant date fair value of equity instruments that have not yet been awarded  the actual impact on future results will depend  in part  on actual awards during any reporting period and various market factors that affect the fair value of those awards 
additionally  while the timing and volume of grants associated with a particular year s long term incentive compensation are within our control  the timing and volume of reload option grants are not 
reload options are awarded to eligible employees and directors to replace previously owned company stock used by those individuals to pay the exercise price  including related employment taxes  of vested pre option awards containing this accelerated ownership feature 
under sfas no 
r  these reload options result in additional compensation expense in the year of grant and for  represented approximately one third of the company s total stock option expense 
the 
table of contents company has not granted options containing an accelerated ownership feature since  however  the potential requirement to award reload options over the contractual year term of the original grants could continue to significantly impact the amount of our stock based compensation expense for a number of years 
we estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using a lattice based option valuation model for annual grants and a black scholes model for reload grants 
these models require us to make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility  employee exercise behavior  and dividend yield 
our methods for selecting these valuation assumptions are explained in note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
in particular  our estimate of stock price volatility is based principally on historical volatility of the options granted  and to a lesser extent  on implied volatilities from traded options on the company s stock 
for the lattice based model  historical volatility corresponds to the year contractual term of the options granted  whereas  for the black scholes model  historical volatility corresponds to the expected term  which is currently years 
we decided to rely more heavily on historical volatility due to the greater availability of data and reliability of trends over longer periods of time  as compared to the terms of more thinly traded options  which rarely extend beyond two years 
at year end  historical volatilities using weekly price observations ranged from approximately for years to for years 
in comparison  implied volatilities averaged approximately for traded options with terms in excess of six months 
based on this data  our weighted average composite volatility assumption for purposes of valuing our option grants during was  as compared to for all other assumptions held constant  a one percentage point increase or decrease in our volatility assumption would increase or decrease the grant date fair value of our option awards by approximately 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions  we are not required to true up grant date fair value based expense to final intrinsic values 
however  these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options  as explained in the following two paragraphs 
furthermore  as historical data has a significant bearing on our forward looking assumptions  significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions  which could then significantly impact the year over year comparability of stock based compensation expense 
sfas no 
r also provides that any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings referred to as a windfall tax benefit will be presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows as a financing rather than an operating cash flow 
if this standard had been adopted in  operating cash flow would have been lower and financing cash flow would have been higher by approximately million as a result of this provision 
for  the corresponding reduction in operating cash flow attributable to windfall tax benefits classified as financing cash flow was million 
the actual impact on future years operating cash flow will depend  in part  on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes 
for balance sheet classification purposes  realized windfall tax benefits are credited to capital in excess of par value within the consolidated balance sheet 
realized shortfall tax benefits amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits  if any  and then charged directly to income tax expense  potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate 
under the transition rules for adopting sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method  we were permitted to calculate a cumulative memo balance of windfall tax benefits from post years for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits 
we completed such study prior to the first period of adoption and currently have sufficient cumulative memo windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls  such that earnings are not currently expected to be affected by this provision 
however  as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control  the likelihood exists of materially different reported results if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 
retirement benefits our company sponsors a number of us and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada 
plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations 
a substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments 
we follow sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions as amended by sfas no 
 effective as of our fiscal year end for the measurement and recognition of obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans 
embodied in both of these standards is 
table of contents the concept that the cost of benefits provided during retirement should be recognized over the employees active working life 
inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date 
major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the long term rates of return on plan assets  the health care cost trend rates  and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans  which cover employees in the united states  united kingdom  and canada 
to conduct our annual review of the long term rate of return on plan assets  we work with third party financial consultants to model expected returns over a year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans 
the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forward looking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on long term bonds  price earnings ratios of the major stock market indices  and long term inflation 
our us plan model  corresponding to approximately of our trust assets globally  currently incorporates a long term inflation assumption of and an active management premium of net of fees validated by historical analysis 
although we review our expected long term rates of return annually  our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not  by itself  significantly influence our evaluation 
our expected rates of return are generally not revised  provided these rates continue to fall within a more likely than not corridor of between the th and th percentile of expected long term returns  as determined by our modeling process 
our assumed rate of return for us plans in of equated to approximately the th percentile expectation of our model 
similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets  reflecting local economic conditions 
foreign trust investments represent approximately of our global benefit plan assets 
based on consolidated benefit plan assets at december   a basis point reduction in the assumed rate of return would increase benefits expense by approximately million 
correspondingly  a basis point shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan assets for would result in a similar amount of arising experience loss 
any arising asset related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated value of plan assets over a five year period 
once recognized  experience gains and losses are amortized using a declining balance method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants  which for us plans is presently about years 
under this recognition method  a basis point shortfall in actual versus assumed performance of all of our plan assets in would reduce pre tax earnings by approximately million in  increasing to approximately million in for each of the three years ending december   our actual return on plan assets exceeded the recognized assumed return by the following amounts in millions   to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates  we work with third party financial consultants to model our actual claims cost data over a five year historical period  including an analysis of pre versus post age groups and other important demographic components of our covered retiree population 
this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends 
our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding short term future trends 
in comparison to our actual five year compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately  our initial trend rate for of reflects the expected future impact of faster growing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population 
our initial rate is trended downward by per year  until the ultimate trend rate of is reached 
the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually  as necessary  to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium 
based on consolidated obligations at december   a basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase benefits expense by approximately million 
a basis point excess of actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an arising experience loss of approximately million 
any arising health care claims cost related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated amount of claims experience over a four year period 
once recognized  experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over years  resulting in at least the minimum amortization prescribed by sfas no 
the net experience gain arising from recognition of claims experience was approximately million 

table of contents to conduct our annual review of discount rates  we use several published market indices with appropriate duration weighting to assess prevailing rates on high quality debt securities  with a primary focus on the citigroup pension liability index for our us plans 
to test the appropriateness of these indices  we periodically engage third party financial consultants to conduct a matching exercise between the expected settlement cash flows of our plans and bond maturities  consisting principally of aa rated or the equivalent in foreign jurisdictions non callable issues with at least million principal outstanding 
the model does not assume any reinvestment rates and assumes that bond investments mature just in time to pay benefits as they become due 
for those years where no suitable bonds are available  the portfolio utilizes a linear interpolation approach to impute a hypothetical bond whose maturity matches the cash flows required in those years 
as of four different interim dates during and  this matching exercise for our us plans produced a discount rate within basis points of the equivalent dated citigroup pension liability index 
the measurement dates for our defined benefit plans are consistent with our company s fiscal year end 
thus  we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year 
based on consolidated obligations at december   a basis point decline in the weighted average discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase benefits expense by approximately million 
all obligation related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 
despite the previously described rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions  we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience 
as of december   we had consolidated unamortized prior service cost and net experience losses of approximately 
billion  as compared to approximately billion at december  the year over year decline in net unamortized amounts was attributable largely to trust asset performance and the favorable impact of rising interest rates on our benefit obligations 
of the total unamortized amounts at december   approximately was related to discount rate reductions  with the remainder primarily related to net unfavorable health care claims cost experience including upward revisions in the assumed trend rate 
for  we currently expect total amortization of prior service cost and net experience losses to be approximately million lower than the actual amount of approximately million 
as discussed on page  total employee benefits expense for is expected to be approximately even with the amount  with higher active health care claims cost and postretirement service and interest cost components offsetting the lower amortization expense 
assuming actual future experience is consistent with our current assumptions  annual amortization of accumulated prior service cost and net experience losses during each of the next several years would remain approximately level with the amount 
income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not succeed 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
our effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate 
for the periods presented  our income tax and related interest reserves have averaged approximately million 
reserve adjustments for individual issues have rarely exceeded of earnings before income taxes annually 
nevertheless  the accumulation of individually insignificant discrete adjustments throughout a particular year has historically impacted our consolidated effective income tax rate by up to basis points 
as discussed on page  for  we believe our rate could be up to basis points lower if pending uncertain tax matters  including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives  are resolved more favorably than we currently expect 
for the periods presented  our policy was to establish reserves that reflected the probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
favorable resolution was recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
as compared to a contingency approach  fin no 
which we adopted at the beginning of is 
table of contents based on a benefit recognition model  which we believe could result in a greater amount of benefit and a lower amount of reserve being initially recognized in certain circumstances 
provided that the tax position is deemed more likely than not of being sustained  fin no 
permits a company to recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being ultimately realized upon settlement 
the tax position must be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained 
despite this difference in conceptual approach  we do not currently expect the adoption of fin no 
to have a significant impact on the amount of benefits recognized in connection with our uncertain tax positions during the current portion of our tax reserves is presented in the balance sheet within accrued income taxes and the amount expected to be settled after one year is recorded in other noncurrent liabilities 
significant tax reserve adjustments impacting our effective tax rate would be separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
future outlook our forecasted consolidated results are generally based on our long term annual growth targets as discussed on page  although we currently expect our internal net sales could increase as much as four percent  slightly exceeding our low single digit growth target 
we expect this higher than targeted growth to come principally from continued category expansion in latin america and strong innovation performance in north america 
despite a projected decline in gross margin of up to basis points  we believe the higher than targeted sales growth will support mid single digit consolidated operating profit growth 
as discussed on page  net interest expense for is expected to be approximately even with results and our consolidated effective income tax rate could be lower than the rate of approximately 
these two factors are expected to provide leverage for purposes of achieving our target of high single digit growth in net earnings per share 
in addition  we remain committed to reinvesting in brand building  cost reduction initiatives  and other growth opportunities 
lastly  we expect our cash flow performance to remain strong and are currently targeting a level of  million for item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our company is exposed to certain market risks  which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations 
we use derivative financial and commodity instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
as a matter of policy  we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our accounting policies related to derivative financial and commodity instruments 
foreign exchange risk our company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases  intercompany loans and product shipments  and nonfunctional currency denominated third party debt 
our company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments 
additionally  our company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars 
primary exposures include the us dollar versus the british pound  euro  australian dollar  canadian dollar  and mexican peso  and in the case of inter subsidiary transactions  the british pound versus the euro 
we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and enter into forward contracts  options  and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in net long or short currency positions 
forward contracts and options are generally less than months duration 
currency swap agreements are established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances 
the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end was million  representing a settlement obligation of million 
the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end was million  representing a settlement obligation of million 
all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions  translational exposure  or existing assets or liabilities  and mature within months 
assuming an unfavorable change in year end exchange rates  the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately million at year end and million at year end these unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures 

table of contents interest rate risk our company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt 
primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates  london interbank offered rates libor  and commercial paper rates 
we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues  and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt  based on current and projected market conditions 
note within notes to consolidated financial statements provides information on our significant debt issues 
there were no interest rate derivatives outstanding at year end and assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately million in and million in price risk our company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials  fuel  and energy 
primary exposures include corn  wheat  soybean oil  sugar  cocoa  paperboard  natural gas  and diesel fuel 
we have historically used the combination of long term contracts with suppliers  and exchange traded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than months 
during  we entered into two separate year over the counter commodity swap transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price of natural gas used principally in its manufacturing processes 
the notional amount of the swaps totaled approximately million  which currently equates to approximately of our north america manufacturing needs 
the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end  including the natural gas swaps  was million  representing a settlement obligation of approximately million 
assuming a decrease in year end commodity prices  the settlement obligation would increase by approximately million  generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases 
the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end was million  representing a settlement receivable of approximately million 
assuming a decrease in year end commodity prices  this settlement receivable would convert to an obligation of approximately million  generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying material purchases 
in addition to the derivative commodity instruments discussed above  we use long term contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure 
it should be noted that the exclusion of these positions from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our company
