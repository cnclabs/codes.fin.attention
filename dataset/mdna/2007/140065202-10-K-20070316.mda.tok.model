the banking business in california generally  and specifically in the company s primary market area  is highly competitive with respect to both loans and deposits 
the banking business is dominated by a relatively small number of major banks which have many offices operating over wide geographic areas 
many of the major commercial banks offer certain services such as international and securities brokerage services which are not offered directly by the company or through its correspondent banks

regulation and supervision regulatory environment the banking and financial services industry is heavily regulated 
regulations  statutes and policies affecting the industry are frequently under review by congress and state legislatures  and by the federal and state agencies charged with supervisory and examination authority over banking institutions 
changes in the banking and financial services industry can be expected to occur in the future 
these changes may create new competitors in geographic and product markets which have historically been limited by law to bank institutions  such as the bank 
changes in the regulation  statutes or policies that impact the company and the bank cannot necessarily be predicted and may have a material effect on their business and earnings 
the operations of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are affected by the regulatory oversight and the credit and monetary policies of the frb 
an important function of the frb is to regulate the national supply of bank credit 
among the instruments of monetary policy used by the frb to implement its objectives are open market operations in us government securities  changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements on bank deposits 
these instruments of monetary policy are used in varying combinations to influence the overall level of bank loans  investments and deposits  the interest rates charged on loans and paid for deposits  the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets  and the level of inflation 
the credit and monetary policies of the frb will continue to have a significant effect on the bank and on the company 
set forth below is a summary of significant statutes  regulations and policies that apply to the operation of banking institutions 
this summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such statutes  regulations and policies 

table of contents bank holding company act the company is registered as a bank holding company under the bank holding company act of  as amended bhca 
as a bank holding company  capital corp of the west is subject to examination by the frb 
pursuant to the bhca  capital corp of the west is also subject to limitations on the kinds of businesses in which it can engage directly or through subsidiaries 
it may  of course  manage or control banks 
generally  however  it is prohibited  with certain exceptions  from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of any class of voting shares of an entity engaged in non banking activities  unless the frb finds such activities to be so closely related to banking as to be deemed a proper incident thereto within the meaning of the bhca 
as a bank holding company  the company may not acquire more than five percent of the voting shares of any domestic bank without the prior approval of or  for well managed companies  prior written notice to the frb 
the bhca includes minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies 
see the section titled regulation and supervision regulatory capital requirements 
regulations and policies of the frb also require a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks 
it is the frb s policy that a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to a subsidiary bank during periods of financial stress or adversity and that it should maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity needed to obtain additional resources for assisting the subsidiary bank 
under certain conditions  the frb may conclude that certain actions of a bank holding company  such as the payment of a cash dividend  would constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
county bank county bank is a california state licensed bank 
the bank is a member of the federal reserve system 
the bank s deposits are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and thus is subject to the rules and regulations of the fdic pertaining to deposit insurance  including deposit insurance assessments 
the bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the frb and the california department of financial institutions the department or dfi 
applicable federal and state regulations address many aspects of the bank s business and activities  including investments  loans  borrowings  transactions with affiliates  branching  reporting and other areas 
county bank may acquire other banks or branches of other banks with the approval of the frb and the department 
county bank is subject to examination by both the frb and the department 
dividends the company may make a distribution to its shareholders if it s retained earnings equal at least the amount of the proposed distribution 
in the event sufficient retained earnings are not available for the proposed distribution  the company may nevertheless make a distribution to its shareholders if  after giving effect to the distribution  the company s assets equal at least of its liabilities and certain other conditions are met 
since the ratio translates into a minimum capital ratio of  most bank holding companies  including the company  based on its current capital ratios  are unable to satisfy this second test 
the primary source of funds for payment of dividends by the company to its shareholders is the receipt of dividends and management fees from the bank 
the bank s ability to pay dividends to the company is limited by applicable state and federal law 
a california state licensed bank may not make a cash distribution to its shareholders in excess of the lesser of i the bank s retained earnings  or ii the bank s net income for its last three fiscal years  less the amount of any distributions made by the bank to its shareholders during such period 
however  with the approval of the dfi  a california state licensed bank may pay dividends in an amount not to exceed the greater of i the bank s retained earnings  ii its net income for its last fiscal year  or iii its net income for the current fiscal year 
the frb  fdic and the dfi have authority to prohibit a bank from engaging in practices which are considered to be unsafe and unsound 
depending on the financial condition of the bank and upon other factors  the frb or the dfi could determine that payment of dividends or other payments by the bank might constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
finally  any dividend that would cause a bank s capital to fall below required regulatory capital levels could also be prohibited 

table of contents regulatory capital requirements the company and the bank are both required to maintain a minimum risk based capital ratio of at least in the form of tier capital of risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
tier capital consists of common equity  non cumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  and excludes goodwill 
tier capital consists of cumulative perpetual preferred stock  limited life preferred stock  mandatorily convertible securities  subordinated debt and subject to a limit of of risk weighted assets general loan loss reserves 
in calculating the relevant ratio  a bank s assets and off balance sheet commitments are risk weighted  thus  for example  loans are included at of their book value while assets considered less risky are included at a percentage of their book value  for example  for inter bank obligations  and for vault cash and us government securities 
the company and the bank are also subject to leverage capital ratio guidelines 
the leverage ratio guidelines require maintenance of a minimum ratio of tier capital to total assets for the most highly rated organizations 
institutions that are less highly rated  anticipating significant growth or subject to other significant risks will be required to maintain capital levels ranging from to above the minimum 
federal regulation has established five tiers of capital measurement  ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized 
federal bank regulatory authorities are required to take prompt corrective action with respect to inadequately capitalized banks 
if a bank does not meet the minimum capital requirements set by its regulators  the regulators are compelled to take certain actions  which may include a prohibition on the payment of dividends to a parent holding company and requiring adoption of an acceptable plan to restore capital to an acceptable level 
failure to comply will result in further sanctions  which may include orders to raise capital  merge with another institution  restrict transactions with affiliates  limit asset growth or reduce asset size  divest certain investments and or elect new directors 
it is the company s intention to maintain risk based capital ratios for itself and for the bank at above the minimum for the well capitalized level tier risk based  total risk based and to maintain the leverage capital ratio for county bank above the minimum for well capitalized banks 
at december   the company s leverage  tier risk based and total risk based capital ratios were  and  and the bank s leverage  tier risk based and total risk based capital ratios were  and 
no assurance can be given that the company or the bank will be able to maintain capital ratios in the well capitalized level in the future 
prompt corrective action the fdic has authority a to request that an institution s primary regulatory agency take enforcement action against it based upon an examination by the fdic or the agency  b if no action is taken within days and the fdic determines that the institution is in an unsafe and unsound condition or that failure to take the action will result in continuance of unsafe and unsound practices  to order that action be taken against the institution  and c to exercise this enforcement authority under exigent circumstances merely upon notification to the institution s primary regulatory agency 
this authority gives the fdic the same enforcement powers with respect to any institution and its subsidiaries and affiliates as the primary regulatory agency has with respect to those entities 
an undercapitalized institution is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its primary federal bank regulatory agency 
the plan must specify a the steps the institution will take to become adequately capitalized  b the capital levels to be attained each year  c how the institution will comply with any regulatory sanctions then in effect against the institution and d the types and levels of activities in which the institution will engage 
the banking agency may not accept a capital restoration plan unless the agency determines  among other things  that the plan is based on realistic assumptions  and is likely to succeed in restoring the institution s capital and would not appreciably increase the risk 


to which the institution is exposed 
a requisite element of an acceptable capital restoration plan for an undercapitalized institution is a guaranty by its parent holding company that the institution will comply with the capital restoration plan 
liability with respect to this guaranty is limited to the lesser of i of the institution s assets at the time when it becomes undercapitalized or ii the amount necessary to bring the institution into capital compliance with applicable capital standards as of the time when the institution fails to comply with the plan 
the guaranty liability is limited to companies controlling the undercapitalized institution and does not affect other affiliates 
in the event of a bank holding company s bankruptcy  any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment over the claims of other creditors  including the holders of the company s long term debt 

table of contents the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia provides that the appropriate federal regulatory agency must require an insured depository institution that is significantly undercapitalized  or that is undercapitalized and either fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan within the time period allowed by regulation or fails in any material respect to implement a capital restoration plan accepted by the appropriate federal banking agency  to take one or more of the following actions a sell enough shares  including voting shares  to become adequately capitalized  b merge with or be sold to another institution or holding company  but only if grounds exist for appointing a conservator or receiver  c restrict specified transactions with banking affiliates as if the sister bank exception to the requirements of section a of the federal reserve act did not exist  d otherwise restrict transactions with bank or non bank affiliates  e restrict interest rates that the institution pays on deposits to prevailing rates in the institution s region  f restrict asset growth or reduce total assets  g alter  reduce or terminate activities  h hold a new election of directors  i dismiss any director or senior executive officer who held office for more than days immediately before the institution became undercapitalized  provided that in requiring dismissal of a director or senior executive officer  the agency must comply with procedural requirements  including the opportunity for an appeal in which the director or officer will have the burden of proving his or her value to the institution  j employ qualified senior executive officers  k cease accepting deposits from correspondent depository institutions  l divest non depository affiliates which pose a danger to the institution  m be divested by a parent holding company  and n take any other action which the agency determines would better carry out the purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions 
in addition to the foregoing sanctions  without the prior approval of the appropriate federal banking agency  a significantly undercapitalized institution may not pay any bonus to any senior executive officer or increase the rate of compensation for a senior executive officer without regulatory approval 
if an undercapitalized institution has failed to submit or implement an acceptable capital restoration plan the appropriate federal banking agency is not permitted to approve the payment of a bonus to a senior executive officer 
not later than days after an institution becomes critically undercapitalized  the institution s primary federal bank regulatory agency must appoint a receiver or a conservator  unless the agency  with the concurrence of the fdic  determines that the purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions would be better served by another course of action 
any alternative determination must be documented by the agency and reassessed on a periodic basis 
notwithstanding the foregoing  a receiver must be appointed after days unless the fdic determines that the institution has positive net worth  is in compliance with a capital plan  is profitable or has a sustainable upward trend in earnings  and is reducing its ratio of non performing loans to total loans  and unless the head of the appropriate federal banking agency and the chairperson of the fdic certify that the institution is viable and not expected to fail 
the fdic is required  by regulation or order  to restrict the activities of critically undercapitalized institutions 
the restrictions must include prohibitions on the institution s doing any of the following without prior fdic approval entering into any material transactions not in the usual course of business  extending credit for any highly leveraged transaction  engaging in any covered transaction as defined in section a of the federal reserve act with an affiliate  paying excessive compensation or bonuses  and paying interest on new or renewed liabilities that would increase the institution s average cost of funds to a level significantly exceeding prevailing rates in the market 
federal reserve borrowings a federal reserve bank may not make advances to an undercapitalized institution for more than days in any day period without a viability certification by a federal bank regulatory agency or by the chairman of the frb after an examination by the frb 
if an institution is deemed critically undercapitalized  an extension of federal reserve bank credit cannot continue for five days without demand for payment unless the federal reserve bank is willing to accept responsibility for any resulting loss to the fdic 
as a practical matter  this provision is likely to mean that federal reserve bank credit will not be extended beyond the limitations in this provision 

table of contents acquisitions of control under applicable federal and state laws  it is unlawful for a person to purchase or otherwise acquire beneficial ownership of shares of common or preferred stock of the bank  without the prior approval of the dfi and a notice of non disapproval from the fdic  if the acquisition would give the person  or any group of persons acting together a group  control of the bank 
the applicable government regulations defined control for these purposes to mean the direct or indirect power i to vote or more of the bank s outstanding shares  or ii to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the bank  whether through ownership of voting securities  by contract or otherwise  provided that no individual will be deemed to control the bank solely on accord of being a director  officer or employee of the bank 
persons who directly or indirectly own or control or more of a bank s outstanding shares are presumed to control the bank 
consumer laws and regulations the bank must also comply with consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks and the privacy of consumers 
while the following list is not exhaustive  these laws and regulations include the truth in lending act  the truth in savings act  the electronic funds transfer act  the expedited funds availability act  the equal credit opportunity act  and the fair housing act  among others 
these laws and regulations mandate disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits or making loans 
the bank must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of its ongoing regulatory compliance and customer relations efforts 
exposure to and management of risk the federal banking agencies examine banks and bank holding companies with respect to their exposure to and management of different categories of risk 
categories of risk identified by the agencies include legal risk  operational risk  market risk  credit risk  interest rate risk  price risk  foreign exchange risk  transaction risk  compliance risk  strategic risk  credit risk  liquidity risk  and reputation risk 
this examination approach causes bank regulators to focus on risk management procedures  rather than simply examining every asset and transaction 
this approach supplements rather than replaces existing rating systems based on the evaluation of an institution s capital  assets  management  earnings and liquidity 
safety and soundness standards federal banking regulators have adopted a safety and soundness rule and interagency guidelines prescribing standards for safety and soundness the guidelines 
the guidelines create standards for a wide range of operational and managerial matters including a internal controls  information systems  and internal audit systems  b loan documentation  c credit underwriting  d interest rate exposure  e asset growth  f compensation and benefits  and g asset quality and earnings 
the community development act of amending the federal deposit insurance act required the agencies to prescribe standards prohibiting as an unsafe and unsound practice the payment of excessive compensation that could result in material financial loss to an institution  and to specify when compensation  fees or benefits become excessive 
the guidelines characterize compensation as excessive if it is unreasonable or disproportionate to the services actually performed by the executive officer  employee  director or principal shareholder being compensated 
federal regulators have stated that the guidelines are meant to be flexible and general enough to allow each institution to develop its own systems for compliance 
with the exception of the standards for compensation and benefits  a failure to comply with the guidelines standards does not necessarily constitute an unsafe and unsound practice or condition 
on the other hand  an institution in conformance with the standards may still be found to be engaged in an unsafe and unsound practice or to be in an unsafe and unsound condition 

table of contents although meant to be flexible  an institution that falls short of the guidelines standards may be requested to submit a compliance plan or be subjected to regulatory enforcement actions 
generally  the federal banking agencies will request a compliance plan if an institution s failure to meet one or more of the standards is of sufficient severity to threaten the safe and sound operation of the institution 
an institution must file a compliance plan within days of request by its primary federal regulator  which is the frb in the case of the bank 
the guidelines provide for prior notice of and an opportunity to respond to the agency s proposed order 
an enforcement action may be commenced if  after being notified that it is in violation of a safety and soundness standard  the institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted plan 
the federal deposit insurance act provides the agencies with a wide range of enforcement powers 
an agency may  for example  obtain an enforceable cease and desist order in the united states district court  or may assess civil money penalties against an institution or its affiliated parties 
legislation and proposed changes from time to time  legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks  bank holding companies and other financial institutions are frequently made in congress  in the california legislature and before various bank regulatory agencies 
for example  from time to time congress has considered various proposals to eliminate the federal thrift charter  create a uniform financial institutions charter  conform holding company regulation  and abolish the office of thrift supervision 
typically  the intent of this type of legislation is to strengthen the banking industry  even if it may on occasion prove to be a burden on management s plans

limitations on activities fdicia prohibits state chartered banks and their subsidiaries from engaging  as principal  in activities not permissible by national banks and their subsidiaries  unless the bank s primary federal regulator determines the activity poses no significant risk to the deposit insurance fund dif and the state bank is and continues to be adequately capitalized 
similarly  state bank subsidiaries may not engage  as principal  in activities impermissible by subsidiaries of national banks 
this prohibition extends to acquiring or retaining any investment  including those that would otherwise be permissible under california law 
the state bank parity act  eliminates certain disparities between california state chartered banks and federally chartered national banks by authorizing the dfi to address such disparities through a streamlined rulemaking process 
the dfi has taken action pursuant to the parity act to authorize  among other matters  previously impermissible share repurchases by state banks  subject to the prior approval of the dfi 
under regulations of the office of the comptroller of the currency occ eligible institutions those national banks that are well capitalized  have a high overall rating and a satisfactory cra rating  and are not subject to an enforcement order may engage in activities related to banking through operating subsidiaries after going through a new expedited application process 
in addition  the new regulations include a provision whereby a national bank may apply to the occ to engage in an activity through a subsidiary in which the bank itself may not engage 
in determining whether to permit the subsidiary to engage in the activity  the occ will evaluate why the bank itself is not permitted to engage in the activity and whether a congressional purpose will be frustrated if the occ permits the subsidiary to engage in the activity 
the state bank parity act may permit state licensed banks to engage in similar activities  subject to the discretion of the dfi

the assessment context takes into account demographic data about the community  the community s characteristics and needs  the institution s capacities and constraints  the institution s product offerings and business strategy  the institution s prior performance  and data on similarly situated lenders 
since the assessment context for each bank is developed by the bank regulatory agencies  a particular bank does not know until it is examined whether its cra programs and efforts have been sufficient

international money laundering abatement and financial anti terrorism act of the terrorist attacks in september   impacted the financial services industry and led to federal legislation that attempts to address certain issues involving financial institutions 
on october   president bush signed into law the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of the usa patriot act 
part of the usa patriot act is the international money laundering abatement and financial anti terrorism act of imlafata

the sox generally applies to all companies  both us and us  that file or are required to file periodic reports with the sec under the exchange act 
the sox includes very specific additional disclosure requirements and new corporate governance rules  requires the sec and securities exchanges to adopt extensive additional disclosure  corporate governance and other related rules  and mandates further studies of certain issues by the sec and the comptroller general 
the sox represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems  such as the regulation of the public company auditing profession  and to state corporate law  such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and a board of directors and its committees 

table of contents the sox addresses  among other matters audit committees for all reporting companies  certification of financial statements by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer  the forfeiture of bonuses or other incentive based compensation and profits from the sale of an issuer s securities by directors and senior officers in the twelve month period following initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement  a prohibition on trading by officers and directors trading during certain black out periods under employee benefit plans  disclosure of off balance sheet transactions  a prohibition on personal loans to directors and officers  expedited filing requirements for form s  disclosure of a code of ethics and filing of a form k for a change or waiver of such code  real time filing of issuers periodic reports  the formation of a public company accounting oversight board  auditor independence  and various increased criminal penalties for violation of securities laws 
the sec has adopted a number of rules designed to implement the provisions of the sox 
regulation w transactions between a bank and its affiliates are quantitatively and qualitatively restricted under the federal reserve act 
the federal deposit insurance act fdia applies section a and b to insured nonmember banks in the same manner and to the same extent as if they were members of the federal reserve system 
the frb has also issued regulation w  which codifies prior regulations under section a and b of the federal reserve act and provides interpretive guidance with respect to affiliate transactions 
regulation w incorporates the exemption from the affiliate transaction rules but expands the exemption to cover the purchase of any type of loan or extension of credit from an affiliate 
affiliates of a bank include  among other entities  the bank s holding company and companies that are under common control with the bank 
the company is considered to be an affiliate of the bank 
in general  subject to certain specified exemptions  a bank or its subsidiaries are limited in their ability to engage in covered transactions with affiliates i to an amount equal to of the bank s capital and surplus in the case of covered transactions with any one affiliate  and ii to an amount equal to of the bank s capital and surplus in the case of covered transactions with all affiliates 
in addition  a bank and its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions and other specified transactions only on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the bank or its subsidiaries  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies 
covered transactions include i a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate  ii a purchase of  or an investment in  securities issued by an affiliate  iii a purchase of assets from an affiliate  with some exceptions  iv the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to any party  and v the issuance of a guarantee  acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate 
additionally  under regulation w  a bank and its subsidiaries may not purchase a low quality asset from an affiliate  covered transactions and other specified transactions between a bank or its subsidiaries and an affiliate must be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices  and with some exceptions  each loan or extension of credit by a bank to an affiliate must be secured by collateral with a market value ranging from to  depending on the type of collateral  of the amount of the loan or extension of credit 
regulation w generally excludes all non bank subsidiaries of the banks from treatment as affiliates  except to the extent that the frb decides to treat these subsidiaries as affiliates 
concurrent with the adoption of regulation w  the frb has proposed a regulation that would further limit the amount of loans that could be purchased by a bank from an affiliate to not more than of the bank s capital and surplus 
the money laundering control act the money laundering control act of provides sanctions for the failure to report high levels of cash deposits to non bank financial institutions 
federal banking regulators possess the power to revoke the charter or appoint a conservator for any institution convicted of money laundering 
offending state chartered banks could lose their federal deposit insurance  and bank officers could face lifetime bans from working in financial institutions 
the community development act  which includes a number of provisions that amend the bank secrecy act  allows the secretary of the treasury to exempt specified currency transactions from reporting requirements and permits the federal bank regulatory agencies to impose civil money penalties on banks for violations of the currency transaction reporting requirements 

table of contents the fair credit reporting act the fair credit reporting act the fcra was adopted to ensure the confidentiality  accuracy  relevancy and proper utilization of consumer credit report information 
under the framework of the fcra  the united states has developed a highly advanced and efficient credit reporting system 
the information contained in that broad system is used by financial institutions  retailers and other creditors of every size in making a wide variety of decisions regarding financial transactions 
employers  and law enforcement agencies have also made wide use of the information collected and maintained in databases made possible by the fcra 
the fcra affirmatively preempts state law in a number of areas  including the ability of entities affiliated by common ownership to share and exchange information freely  the requirements on credit bureaus to reinvestigate the contents of reports in response to consumer complaints  among others 
recent legislation the fdic finalized its interim final rule  with changes  that amended its deposit insurance regulations to implement applicable revisions to the federal deposit insurance act made by the federal deposit insurance reform act of and the federal deposit insurance reform conforming amendments act of the final rule provides for consideration of inflation adjustments to increase the current standard maximum deposit insurance amount of  on a five year cycle beginning in  increases the deposit insurance limit for certain retirement accounts from  to  also subject to inflation adjustments  and provides per participant insurance coverage to employee benefit plan accounts  even if the depository institution at which the deposits are placed is not authorized to accept employee benefit plan deposits 
the final rule is effective on october  the board of governors of the federal reserve system amended regulation e  which implements the electronic fund transfer act  and the official staff commentary to the regulation  which interprets the requirements of regulation e to become effective on july  the final rule provides that regulation e covers payroll card accounts that are established directly or indirectly through an employer  and to which transfers of the consumer s salary  wages  or other employee compensation are made on a recurring basis 
the final rule also provides financial institutions with an alternative to providing periodic statements for payroll card accounts if they make account information available to consumers by specified means 
the federal financial regulatory agencies in september issued final guidance to address the risks posed by nontraditional residential mortgage products that allow borrowers to defer repayment of principal and sometimes interest  including interest only mortgages and payment option adjustable rate mortgages 
these products allow borrowers to exchange lower payments during an initial period for higher payments later 
the lack of principal amortization and the potential for negative amortization and features that compound risks such as no document loans and simultaneous second mortgages elevate the concern of the federal banking agencies for nontraditional mortgage products 
the guidelines require depository institutions to ensure that loan terms and underwriting standards are consistent with prudent lending practices  including consideration of a borrower s repayment capacity  to recognize that many nontraditional mortgage loans  particularly when they have risk layering features  are untested in a stressed environment 
the guidelines also express the need for depository institutions to have strong risk management standards  capital levels commensurate with the risk  an allowance for loan and lease losses that reflects the collectibility of the portfolio  and the need to make sure that consumers have sufficient information to clearly understand loan terms and associated risks prior to making a product or payment choice 

table of contents the federal financial regulatory agencies in december issued a new interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses alll along with supplemental frequently asked questions 
the policy statement revises and replaces a policy statement on the alll 
the agencies issued the revised policy statement in view of today s uncertain economic environment and the presence of concentrations in untested loan products in the loan portfolios of insured depository institutions 
the policy statement has also been revised to conform with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and post supervisory guidance 
the policy statement described the responsibilities of the boards of directors  management  and banking examiners regarding the alll  factors to be considered in the estimation of the alll  and the objectives and elements of an effective loan review system  including a sound credit grading system 
the policy statement reiterates that each institution has a responsibility for developing  maintaining and documenting a comprehensive  systematic  and consistently applied process appropriate to its size and the nature  scope  and risk of its lending activities for determining the amounts of the alll and the provision for loan and lease losses and states that each institution should ensure controls are in place to consistently determine the alll in accordance with gaap  the institution s stated policies and procedures  management s best judgment and relevant supervisory guidance 
the policy statement also restates that insured depository institutions must maintain an alll at a level that is appropriate to cover estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans determined to be impaired as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan and lease portfolio  and that estimates of credit losses should reflect consideration of all significant factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
the policy statement states that prudent  conservative  but not excessive  loan loss allowances that represent management s best estimate from within an acceptable range of estimated losses are appropriate 
the office of the comptroller of the currency  the board of governors of the federal reserve system  and the federal deposit insurance corporation in december issued final guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending 
the agencies observed that the commercial real estate is an area in which some banks are becoming increasingly concentrated  especially with small to medium sized banks that face strong competition in their other business lines 
the agencies support banks serving a vital role in their communities by supplying credit for business and real estate development 
however  the agencies are concerned that rising commercial real estate loan concentrations may expose institutions to unanticipated earnings and capital volatility in the event of adverse changes in commercial real estate markets 
the guidance provides supervisory criteria  including numerical indicators to assist in identifying institutions with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny  but such criteria are not limits on commercial real estate lending 
in california  effective january   a new law financial code section recognizes the ability of mortgage brokers to obtain the benefit of non interest bearing accounts on trust funds deposited in a commercial bank 
the provision applies to real estate brokers who collect payments or provide services in connection with a loan secured by a lien on real property and permits a mortgage broker to earn interest on an interest bearing account at a financial institution 
interest on funds received by a real estate broker who collects payments or provides services for an institutional investor in connection with a loan secured by commercial real property may inure to the broker  if agreed to in writing by the broker and the institutional investor 
for purposes of this law  commercial real property means real estate improved with other than a one to four family residence 
a new california law makes it easier for california banks to accept deposits from local government agencies 
under the old law  local agency deposits over  had to be secured by collateral 
pursuant to the enactment of assembly bill  banks would be able to acquire surplus public deposits exceeding  without pledging collateral if they participate in a deposit placement service where excess amounts are placed in certificates of deposit at other institutions within a network 
such a network of which currently there is only one available in the market permits the entire amount of a customer s deposit to be fdic insured  and the bank taking the original deposit retains the benefit of the full amount of the deposit for lending or other purposes 
ab clarifies that a local agency may deposit up to of its surplus funds in certificates of deposit at a bank  savings association  savings bank  or credit union that participates in such a deposit sharing network 
since the entire amount of the deposits would be fdic insured  a bank would not be required to pledge collateral 
the bill permits agencies to make these deposits until january  
table of contents conclusions it is impossible to predict with any degree of accuracy the competitive impact the laws and regulations described above will have on commercial banking in general and on the business of the company in particular 
it is anticipated that the banking industry will continue to be a highly regulated industry 
additionally  there appears to be a continued lessening of the historical distinction between the services offered by financial institutions and other businesses offering financial services 
finally  the trend toward nationwide interstate banking is expected to continue 
as a result of these factors  it is anticipated banks will experience increased competition for deposits and loans and  possibly  further increases in their cost of doing business 
item a 
risk factors risk factors readers and prospective investors in our securities should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations 
this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if this were to happen  the value of the company s securities could decline significantly  and shareholders could lose all or part of their investment 
market and interest rate risk changes in interest rates could reduce income and cash flow the discussion in this report under market and interest rate risk management and earnings sensitivity is incorporated by reference in this paragraph 
the company s income and cash flow depend to a great extent on the difference between the interest earned on loans and investment securities  and the interest paid on deposits and other borrowings 
we cannot control or prevent changes in the level of interest rates 
they fluctuate in response to general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies  in particular  the frb 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  will influence the origination of loans  the purchase of investments  the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits and other liabilities 
risks related to the nature and geographical location of capital corp of the west s business capital corp of the west invests in loans that contain inherent credit risks that may cause us to incur losses the company closely monitors the markets in which it conducts its lending operations and adjusts its strategy to control exposure to loans with higher credit risk 
asset reviews are performed using grading standards and criteria similar to those employed by bank regulatory agencies 
we can provide no assurance that the credit quality of our loans will not deteriorate in the future and that such deterioration will not adversely affect capital corp of the west 
deterioration of local economic conditions could hurt our profitability 
our operations are primarily located in the central valley of california 
as a result of this geographic concentration  our financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in these areas 
the local economy relies heavily on real estate  agriculture and ranching 
a significant downturn in any or all of these industries could result in a decline in the local economy in general  which could in turn negatively impact us 
poor economic conditions could cause us to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in our loan portfolio 
also  if there were significant recessionary conditions in our market area  our financial condition would be negatively impacted 

table of contents the markets in which capital corp of the west operates are subject to the risk of earthquakes and other natural disasters most of the properties of capital corp of the west are located in california 
also  most of the real and personal properties which currently secure the company s loans are located in california 
california is a state which is prone to earthquakes  brush fires  flooding and other natural disasters 
in addition to possibly sustaining damage to its own properties  if there is a major earthquake  flood or other natural disaster  capital corp of the west faces the risk that many of its borrowers may experience uninsured property losses  or sustained job interruption and or loss which may materially impair their ability to meet the terms of their loan obligations 
a major earthquake  flood or other natural disaster in california could have a material adverse effect on capital corp of the west s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
substantial competition in the california banking market could adversely affect us banking is a highly competitive business 
we compete actively for loan  deposit  and other financial services business in california 
our competitors include a large number of state and national banks  thrift institutions and credit unions  as well as many financial and non financial firms that offer services similar to those offered by us 
other competitors include large financial institutions that have substantial capital  technology and marketing resources 
such large financial institutions may have greater access to capital at a lower cost than us  which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 
risks associated with potential acquisitions or divestitures or restructuring may adversely affect us we may seek to acquire or invest in financial and non financial companies  technologies  services or products that complement our business 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing any such acquisition or investment as this will depend on the availability of prospective target opportunities at valuation levels which we find attractive and the competition for such opportunities from other bidders 
in addition  we continue to evaluate the performance of all of our subsidiaries  businesses and business lines and may sell  liquidate or otherwise divest a subsidiary  business or business line 
any acquisitions  divestitures or restructuring may result in the issuance of potentially dilutive equity securities  significant write offs  including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets  and or the incurrence of debt  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
acquisitions  divestitures or restructuring could involve numerous additional risks including difficulties in obtaining any required regulatory approvals and in the assimilation or separation of operations  services  products and personnel  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  higher than expected deposit attrition run off  divestitures required by regulatory authorities  the disruption of our business  and the potential loss of key employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered 
regulatory risks restrictions on dividends and other distributions could limit amounts payable to us as a holding company  a substantial portion of our cash flow typically comes from dividends of our bank 
various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends our bank can pay to us without regulatory approval 
adverse effects of  or changes in  banking or other laws and regulations or governmental fiscal or monetary policies could adversely affect us we are subject to significant federal and state regulation and supervision  which is primarily for the benefit and protection of our customers and not for the benefit of investors 
in the past  our business has been materially affected by these regulations 
this trend is likely to continue in the future 
laws  regulations or policies  including accounting standards and interpretations currently affecting us and our subsidiaries  may change at any time 
regulatory authorities may also change their interpretation of these statutes and regulations 
therefore  our business may be adversely affected by any future changes in laws  regulations  policies or interpretations or regulatory approaches to compliance and enforcement  including legislative and regulatory reactions to acts of terrorism  and major us corporate bankruptcies and reports of accounting irregularities at us public companies 

table of contents additionally  our business is affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies 
we are particularly affected by the policies of the frb  which regulates the supply of money and credit in the us under long standing policy of the frb  the company is expected to act as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary banks 
as a result of that policy  we may be required to commit financial and other resources to our subsidiary bank in circumstances where we might not otherwise do so 
among the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb are a conducting open market operations in us government securities  b changing the discount rates of borrowings by depository institutions  and c imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates 
these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits  as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the policies of the frb may have a material effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
systems  accounting and internal control risks the accuracy of the company s judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will impact operating results and financial condition the discussion under critical accounting policies and estimates in this report and the information referred to in that discussion is incorporated by reference in this paragraph 
the company s makes certain estimates and judgments in preparing its financial statements 
the quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will have an impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
the company s information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security the company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the company s customer relationship management and systems 
there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately corrected by the company
