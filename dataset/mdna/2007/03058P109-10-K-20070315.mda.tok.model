its access to capital markets or the costs of this capital could be affected by economic  financial  competitive and other conditions beyond its control

the bank s loan portfolio consists of commercial real estate loans  commercial and industrial loans  agricultural loans  residential mortgage loans  residential construction loans and installment and other loans 
the majority of the loans held by the bank were to borrowers within the bank s principal market areas 
commercial real estate loans 
commercial real estate loans primarily consist of loans to purchase  refinance or construct commercial and multifamily properties 
loans are also provided for land acquisition and development 
these loans are secured by real estate  generally mature in one to ten years and can be fixed or adjustable rate 
commercial construction loans may involve additional risks because loan funds are collateralized by the project under construction  which is of uncertain value prior to completion 
delays may arise from labor problems  material shortages  and other unpredictable contingencies that may occur 
it is important to evaluate accurately the total loan funds required to complete a project and related loan to value ratios 
because of these factors  the analysis of prospective construction loan projects requires an expertise that is different in significant respects from the expertise required for other commercial real estate lending 
the bank s underwriting criteria are designed to evaluate and minimize the risks of each commercial construction loan 
among other things  the bank s management considers evidence of the availability of permanent financing for the borrower  the reputation of the borrower  the amount of the borrower s equity in the project  the independent appraisal and review of cost estimates  the pre construction sale and leasing information  and the cash flow projections of the borrower 
commercial and industrial loans 
commercial and industrial loans primarily consist of loans to businesses for various purposes  including term loans  revolving lines of credit  equipment financing loans and letters of credit 
these loans generally mature within one to five years  have adjustable rates and are secured by inventory  accounts receivable or equipment  although certain loans are unsecured 
commercial lending risk results from dependence on income production for future repayment and  in certain circumstances  the lack of tangible collateral 
commercial and industrial loans are underwritten based on the financial strength and repayment ability of the borrower  as well as the value of any collateral securing the loans 
commercial lending operations rely on a strong credit culture that combines prudent credit policies and individual lender accountability 
agricultural loans 
agricultural loans primarily consist of farm loans to finance operating expenses 
these loans generally mature within one year  have adjustable rates and are secured by farm real estate  equipment  crops or livestock 
since agricultural loans present risks not associated with other types of lending  such as weather  the policy of the bank is to make such loans only to agricultural producers that carry crop insurance  thereby mitigating the risk of loss attributable to a crop failure caused by weather factors 
residential mortgage loans 
residential mortgage loans include various types of loans for which residential real property is held as collateral 
these loans include adjustable and fixed rate first mortgage loans secured by one to four family residential properties  second mortgage loans secured by one to four family residential properties and home equity lines of credit 
mortgage loans that are held in portfolio typically mature or reprice in one to five years and require payments on amortization schedules ranging from one year to years 
the bank sells most of its fixed rate real estate mortgage loans with maturities of more than ten years 
residential construction loans 
construction loans are primarily made to individuals and contractors to construct single family residences 
these loans typically have maturities of one year and variable interest rates 

table of contents the bank s policies generally require that a permanent financing commitment be in place before a construction loan is made to an individual borrower 
construction loans have unique risks because loan funds are collateralized by the project under construction  which is of uncertain value prior to completion 
delays may arise from labor problems  material shortages and other unpredictable contingencies that may occur 
it is important to evaluate accurately the total loan funds required to complete a project and related loan to value ratios 
because of these factors  the analysis of prospective construction loan projects requires an expertise that is different in significant respects from the expertise required for real estate mortgage lending 
construction lending is generally considered to involve a higher degree of collateral risk than long term financing of residential properties 
the bank s underwriting criteria are designed to evaluate and minimize the risks of each real estate construction loan 
among other things  the bank s management considers evidence of the availability of permanent financing for the borrower  the reputation of the borrower  the amount of the borrower s equity in the project  the independent appraisal and review of cost estimates  pre construction sale and leasing information  and the cash flow projections of the borrower 
installment and other loans 
installment and other loans are primarily automobile and personal loans  otherwise known as consumer loans 
these loans generally have maturities of five years or less  and are offered at adjustable and fixed interest rates 
consumer lending may involve special risks  including decreases in the value of collateral and transaction costs associated with foreclosure and repossession 
principal market area and competition the bank s financial centers are located in the four largest metropolitan areas in eastern and central washington spokane  yakima  walla walla and the tri cities area comprised of pasco  kennewick and richland  and in suburban and rural communities in eastern and central washington and northern idaho 
additionally  a loan production office doing business as precision bank was opened during in the salt lake city  utah  metropolitan area 
the bank competes primarily with large national and regional banks  as well as community banks  credit unions  savings and loans  mortgage companies and other financial service providers 
management also believes that its competitive position has been strengthened by the continued consolidation in the banking industry  which has resulted in many independent community banks becoming part of large national or regional banks 
the bank s strategy  by contrast  is to remain closely tied to a community banking model with strong local connections 
the following table presents the bank s market share percentage and rank for total deposits in each county where it has financial center operations 
the table also indicates the ranking by deposit size in each market 
all information in the table was obtained from snl financial of charlottesville  virginia  which compiles deposit data published by the fdic as of june  and updates the information for any bank mergers completed subsequent to the reporting date

table of contents employees as of december   the company had full time equivalent employees  none of which are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
management believes employee relations are currently good 
supervision and regulation the laws and regulations applicable to the company and the bank are primarily intended to protect depositors of the bank and not shareholders 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently introduced in congress  in state legislatures and by various bank regulatory agencies 
changes in applicable laws and regulations or in the policies of banking and other government regulators may have a material effect on the business and prospects of the company or the bank 
the likelihood and timing of any such proposals or legislation and the impact they might have on the company or the bank cannot be determined

the federal and state laws that apply to the bank regulate  among other things  the scope of its business  its investments  its reserves against deposits  the timing of the availability of deposited funds and the nature and amount of and collateral for loans 

table of contents premiums for deposit insurance 
the deposits of the bank are currently insured to a maximum amount allowable per depositor through the deposit insurance fund dif administered by the fdic 
the fdic has implemented a new risk based insurance premium system effective january  under which banks are assessed insurance premiums based on how much risk they present to the dif 
banks with higher levels of capital and a lower degree of supervisory risk are assessed lower premium rates than banks with lower levels of capital and or a higher degree of supervisory risk 
these premium rates are applied to the average balance of deposits in the prior quarter 
the fdic has provided a one time assessment credit to eligible institutions based on the assessment base of the institution as of december   as compared to the combined aggregate assessment base of all eligible institutions as of that date 
this one time assessment credit is expected to offset most of the deposit insurance premiums of the bank during the fdic may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule in order to manage the dif to prescribed statutory target levels 
an increase in the assessment rate could have an adverse effect on the bank s earnings  depending upon the amount of the increase 
the fdic may terminate deposit insurance if it determines the institution involved has engaged in or is engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices  is in unsafe or unsound condition  or has violated applicable laws  regulations or orders 
community reinvestment act 
the community reinvestment act cra requires that  in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their jurisdiction  regulators must evaluate the records of the financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with the safe and sound operation of those banks 
these factors are also considered in evaluating mergers  acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility 
as of the bank s most recent cra examination in  the bank s rating was satisfactory 
insider credit transactions 
banks are also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the federal reserve act on extensions of credit to executive officers  directors  principal shareholders and any related interests of such persons 
extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not covered above and who are not employees  and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons 
a violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties on the affected bank or any officer  director  employee  agent or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of that bank  the imposition of a cease and desist order and other regulatory sanctions 
federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia 
under fdicia  each federal banking agency has prescribed  by regulation  non capital safety and soundness standards for institutions under its authority 
these standards cover internal controls  information and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  compensation  fees and benefits  such other operational and managerial standards as the agency determines to be appropriate  and standards for asset quality  earnings and stock valuation 
an institution which fails to meet these standards must develop a plan acceptable to the agency  specifying the steps that the institution will take to meet the standards 
failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions 
management believes that the bank meets all such standards and  therefore  does not believe that these regulatory standards materially affect its business operations 
privacy 
the fdic and other bank regulatory agencies  pursuant to the financial modernization act of  have published guidelines and adopted final regulations privacy rules which  among other things  require each financial institution to develop  implement and maintain  under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or committee thereof  a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information  protect against anticipated threats to the security or integrity of such information  and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information  and provide notice to customers and other consumers under certain circumstances about its privacy policies  
table of contents describe the conditions under which the institution may disclose nonpublic information to nonaffiliated third parties and provide a method for consumers to prevent the institution from disclosing that information to most nonaffiliated third parties by opting out of its disclosure policy  subject to certain exceptions 
in addition  sections and b of the gramm leach bliley act glba require financial institutions to establish appropriate policies  procedures and processes relating to administrative  technical and physical safeguards for customer records and information 
management believes the bank is currently in substantive compliance with the privacy rules and the glba 
dividends 
the bank is subject to restrictions on the payment of cash dividends to the parent company 
the principal sources of the parent company s cash are dividends received from its subsidiary bank  the issuance of junior subordinated debentures and cash received from the exercise of stock options 
regulatory authorities may prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying dividends which would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
in addition  a bank may not pay cash dividends if that payment could reduce the amount of its capital below that necessary to meet the adequately capitalized level in accordance with regulatory capital requirements 
also  the payment of cash dividends by the bank must satisfy a net profits test and an undivided profits test or the bank must obtain prior approval of its regulators before such dividend is paid 
the net profits test limits the dividend declared in any calendar year to the net profits of the current year plus retained net income of the preceding two years 
the undivided profits test limits the dividends declared to the undivided profits on hand after deducting bad debts in excess of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
based on the regulatory restrictions noted above  the bank could pay up to million in dividends as of december   and remain adequately capitalized  but regulatory approval would be required to pay more than million 
the company is not currently subject to any regulatory restrictions on dividends other than those noted above 
capital adequacy 
federal bank regulatory agencies use capital adequacy guidelines in the examination and regulation of banks and bank holding companies 
if capital falls below minimum guideline levels  a bank or bank holding company may be denied approval  among other things  to acquire or establish additional banks or non bank businesses or to open new facilities 
the fdic and frb use risk based capital guidelines for banks and bank holding companies 
these are designed to make such capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies  to account for off balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  using a formula that assigns specific risk weights to different groups of assets and off balance sheet items 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets 
federal regulations establish minimum requirements for the capital adequacy of depository institutions  such as banks and bank holding companies 
the frb may require that a banking organization maintain ratios in excess of the minimums  particularly organizations contemplating significant expansion programs 
current guidelines require all bank holding companies and federally regulated banks to maintain a minimum risk based total capital ratio equal to  of which at least must be tier i capital 
tier i capital for bank holding companies includes common shareholders equity  certain qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less specified intangible assets and accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
the company s and bank s regulatory capital ratios are reported in note to the consolidated financial statements in item the frb also employs a leverage ratio  which is tier i capital as a percentage of total average assets less intangibles  as a supplement to risk based guidelines 
the principal objective of the leverage ratio is to constrain the maximum degree to which a bank holding company may leverage its equity capital base 
the frb requires a minimum leverage ratio of 
however  for all but the most highly rated bank holding companies and for bank holding companies seeking to expand  the frb generally expects an additional amount of capital of at least to 

table of contents fdicia created a statutory framework of supervisory actions indexed to the capital level of the individual institution 
under regulations adopted by the fdic  an institution is assigned to one of five capital categories depending on its total risk based capital ratio  tier i risk based capital ratio and leverage ratio  together with certain subjective factors 
the bank is considered well capitalized as of december   which is the highest of the five categories 
institutions which are deemed to be undercapitalized may be subject to certain mandatory supervisory corrective actions 
effects of government monetary policy 
the earnings and growth of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government  particularly the frb 
the frb can and does implement national monetary policy for such purposes as curbing inflation and combating recession  but its open market operations in us government securities  control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings from the frb  and establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits  also influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits and affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits 
the nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on the company and the bank cannot be predicted with certainty 
sarbanes oxley controls and procedures 
the sarbanes oxley act of and related rulemaking by the securities and exchange commission sec  which effected sweeping corporate disclosure and financial reporting reform  generally require public companies to maintain and carefully monitor a system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures 
as a result  public companies such as americanwest bancorporation must make disclosures about the adequacy of controls and procedures in periodic sec reports ie  forms k and q and their chief executive and chief financial officers must certify in these filings  among other things  that they are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures and disclose their conclusions about the effectiveness of such controls and procedures based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by the relevant report 
additionally  as a result  most public companies have enhanced controls and procedures 
the company is monitoring the status of other related ongoing rulemaking by the sec and other regulatory entities 
management believes that the company is in compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of anti terrorism legislation 
the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of usa patriot act  designed to deny terrorists and others the ability to obtain anonymous access to the us financial system  had a significant impact on depository institutions 
the usa patriot act  together with the implementing regulations of various federal regulatory agencies  required financial institutions to implement additional or amend existing policies and procedures with respect to  among other things  anti money laundering compliance  suspicious activity and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers 
they also permit information sharing for counter terrorist purposes between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions  as well as among financial institutions  subject to certain conditions  and require the frb and other federal banking agencies to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering activities when considering applications filed under section of the bhca or the bank merger act 
management believes that the bank is currently in compliance with all effective requirements prescribed by the usa patriot act 
item a 
risk factors 
the following risk factors are not listed in any particular order and should not be considered to include all risks to the company 
the company s business is subject to interest rate risk  and variations in interest rates may harm financial performance 
unfavorable changes in the interest rate environment may reduce profits 
it is expected that the company will continue to realize income from the differential  or spread  between the interest earned on loans  securities and other interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits  borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and repricing 
table of contents characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  loan volume and yields are affected by market interest rates on loans  and rising interest rates generally are associated with a lower volume of loan originations 
an increase in the general level of interest rates may increase the net interest margin and loan yield  but it may adversely affect the ability of borrowers with variable rate loans to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations 
the company does not have control of these factors 
accordingly  changes in levels of market interest rates could materially harm the net interest spread  asset quality  loan origination volume and overall profitability 
the company faces strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services  which could harm business 
the company currently conducts its banking operations primarily in central and eastern washington and northern idaho 
in  the company opened a loan production office in the salt lake city  utah area and expects to continue its expansion into utah during increased competition in our markets may result in reduced loans and deposits 
ultimately  the company may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
many competitors offer the same banking services within the market area of the bank 
these competitors include national banks  regional banks and other community banks 
the company also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions including  without limitation  savings and loan institutions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  credit unions  mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries 
in particular  the competitors include several major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and atms and conduct extensive promotional and advertising campaigns 
additionally  banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve the credit needs of larger customers 
areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits  efforts to obtain deposits  and range and quality of products and services provided  including new technology driven products and services 
technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets as technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services 
the company also faces competition from out of state financial intermediaries that have opened low end production offices or that solicit deposits in the bank s market areas 
if the bank is unable to attract and retain banking customers  the company may be unable to continue to grow the loan and deposit portfolios  and results of operations and financial condition may otherwise be harmed 
changes in economic conditions  in particular an economic slowdown in the company s market area  could harm business 
the company s business is directly impacted by factors such as economic  political and market conditions  broad trends in industry and finance  legislative and regulatory changes  changes in government monetary and fiscal policies and inflation  all of which are beyond the company s control 
a deterioration in economic conditions  whether caused by national or local concerns  in particular an economic slowdown in central and eastern washington and northern idaho  could result in the following consequences  any of which could materially hurt the business of the company loan delinquencies may increase  problem assets and foreclosures may increase  demand for products and services may decrease  low cost or noninterest bearing deposits may decrease  and collateral for loans made by the bank  especially real estate  may decline in value  in turn reducing customers borrowing power and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans 
the states of washington and idaho and certain local governments in the market area presently face fiscal challenges the long term impact of which on either state s or the local economy cannot be predicted 
a downturn in the real estate market could harm business 
a significant downturn in the real estate market  especially in those markets served by the bank  could harm business because a significant portion of the bank s loans are secured by real estate 
the ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished  and the bank would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans 

table of contents a substantial amount of the bank s real property collateral is located in central and eastern washington 
the bank has significant concentrations of credit in commercial real estate loans 
real estate values could be affected by  among other things  an economic slowdown  an increase in interest rates  drought and other natural disasters  specific to washington 
the company is dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may harm prospects 
the company currently depends heavily on the services of its president and chief executive officer  robert m 
daugherty  and a number of other key management personnel 
the loss of mr 
daugherty s services or that of other key personnel could harm the results of operations and financial condition 
success also depends in part on the ability to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel 
competition for such personnel is strong in the banking industry  and the company may not be successful in attracting or retaining the personnel required

if the nonperforming loans would have been performing during the year  the company would have recognized an additional million in interest income 
analysis of allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established to absorb known and inherent losses primarily resulting from loans outstanding 
accordingly  all loan losses are charged to the allowance and all recoveries are credited to it 
the provision for credit losses charged to operating expense is based on past credit loss experience and other factors which in management s judgment deserve current recognition in estimating probable credit losses 
such other factors include growth and composition of the loan portfolio  credit concentrations  trends in portfolio volume  maturities  delinquencies and nonaccruals  the relationship of the allowance for loan losses to outstanding loans  historical loss trends and general economic conditions 
while management uses the best information available to base its estimates  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions  particularly in the company s market areas  differ substantially from the assumptions initially used 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination

 selected loan loss allowance methodology and documentation issues 
additionally  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
and no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
these accounting pronouncements require specific identification of an allowance for loan loss for an impaired loan 
to this end  the company developed a systematic methodology using a nine grade risk rating system to determine its allowance for loan losses 
on a quarterly basis  the allowance is recalculated using the methodology to determine if the amount allocated is adequate 
this methodology includes a detailed analysis of the loan portfolio that is performed by competent and well trained personnel who have the skills and experience to perform analyses  estimates  reviews and other loan loss methodology functions 
all loans are considered in the analysis  either on an individual or group basis  using current and reliable data 
loans are evaluated for impairment on an individual basis  if applicable  and the remainder of the portfolio is segmented into groups of loans with similar risk characteristics 
management considers all relevant internal and external factors that may affect loan collections  including interest  if applicable 
additionally  the methodology includes consideration of particular risks inherent in different kinds of lending 
current collateral values  less costs to sell  are considered in cases where this type of analysis is applicable 
the analysis ensures the credit loss allowance balance and methodology is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and  further  that it also complies with the provisions of the interagency policy statement issued in by the federal bank regulatory agencies 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate as of december  at december  and  the company had approximately million and million  respectively  of loans that were not classified as nonperforming but for which known information about the borrower s financial condition caused management to have concern about the ability of the borrowers to comply with the repayment terms of the loans 
these loans were identified through the loan review process described above that provides for assignment of a risk rating based on a nine grade scale 
based on the evaluation of current market conditions  loan collateral  other secondary sources of repayment and cash flow generation  management does not anticipate any significant losses related to these loans 
these loans are subject to continuing management attention and are considered in the determination of the allowance for credit losses 
a decline in the economic conditions in the company s market areas or other factors could adversely impact individual borrowers or the loan portfolio in general 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that other

the line was not used during the company s total stockholders equity increased to million at december  as compared to million at december  this increase is related to retained net income of million and stock issued and the value of options acquired related to the ctb merger of million 
at december   stockholders equity was of total assets  compared to at december  at december  and  the company also held cash and cash equivalent assets of million and million  respectively 
the capital levels of the company and the bank exceeded applicable regulatory well capitalized guidelines at december  and regulatory capital ratios can be reviewed in note regulatory matters in item of this report 
effects of inflation and changing prices 
the primary impact of inflation on the company s operations is increased asset yields  deposit costs and operating overhead 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
the effects of inflation can magnify the growth of assets  and if significant  would require that equity capital increase at a faster rate than would otherwise be necessary

off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  the company has entered into off balance sheet financial instruments consisting of commitments to extend credit  commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit 
such financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading and are recorded in the financial statements when they are funded or related fees are incurred or received 
since many of the commitments will expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements 
the following summarizes the amount of commitments per expiration period in thousands less than year years years thereafter total commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written total recent accounting pronouncements refer to note in item of this report

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the primary form of market risk to which financial institutions are exposed is interest rate risk 
this is the effect of changes in market interest rates on a financial institution s income  fair values of assets and liabilities and capital 
any changes in market interest rates may impact the financial institution s net interest income  the spread between the interest earned on loans  securities and other interest earning assets  and interest paid on deposits  borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
the company has an asset liability management committee alco  consisting of senior managers and a board of directors representative  to monitor interest rate risk 
the alco meets quarterly to review current 
table of contents interest rate sensitivity and plan balance sheet and pricing strategies 
the alco looks at many components of interest rate risk 
repricing risk results from differences between the timing of market rate changes and the timing of cash flows of the bank s assets and liabilities 
basis risk comes from changes in the relationship between different market rates on assets and liabilities and their impact on the bank s earnings 
yield curve risk arises from changes in the shape of the yield curve 
all of these aspects of interest rate risk are considered by management in monitoring the bank s market risk profile 
as is true for any banking services provider  unfavorable changes in the interest rate environment may reduce profits 
net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  loan volumes and yields are affected by market interest rates on loans for example rising interest rates are generally associated with a lower volume of loan originations 
while an increase in the general level of interest rates may increase the net interest margin and loan yields  it may adversely affect the ability of borrowers with variable rate loans to make principal and interest payments 
accordingly  changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect the net interest spread  asset quality  loan origination volume and overall profitability 
net interest income sensitivity to monitor the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income  the company employs an interest rate simulation model 
the model integrates existing balance sheet maturity and repricing detail with various assumptions including prepayment projections and interest rate spreads over key index rates 
this simulation measures changes in net interest income over one year that would occur if market interest rates move in even increments up or down by and basis points  that is  if rates change by and basis points each month over months 
all yield curve shifts are parallel in this simulation and any loans or deposits that prepay or mature are replaced by like instruments to keep the balance sheet composition constant 
based on the simulation results  shown below as of december  and  the company s net interest income may increase under rising interest rates and decline under falling interest rates  indicating that the company is slightly asset sensitive 
percentage change in net interest income over months rate scenario rates increase basis points rates increase basis points rates decrease basis points rates decrease basis points the company s asset sensitivity increased during primarily due to a change in management expectations for the magnitude of the likely increase in transaction account rates as compared to the rise in market rates 
the magnitude of the increase is expected to be lower in as compared to expectations for based on market experience 
it should be noted that the preceding interest rate sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast by the company and should not be relied upon as being indicative of future operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based on numerous assumptions including  but not limited to the nature and timing of interest rate levels  yield curve shape  repayments on loans and securities  and pricing decisions on loans and deposits 
as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results may also differ due to prepayment and refinancing levels deviating from those assumed  the varying impact on adjustable rate assets of interest rate change caps and floors  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  and depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes 
also  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect future actions that the alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in 
table of contents interest rates 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot give any assurance as to the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
the company s policy sets limits on allowable change in one year net interest income if rates rise or fall by basis points 
percentage changes noted in the table above are within these limits 
economic value of equity as a further means of quantifying interest rate risk  the company s management looks at the economic perspective by capturing the impact of interest rate changes on the net value of future cash flows  or economic value of equity eve 
to determine the economic value of equity  cash flows projected from the company s current assets and liabilities are discounted based on current market rates 
investment securities are valued using current market prices 
loans are discounted at current bank pricing spreads to market reference rates 
deposits and borrowings are discounted based on the fhlb yield curve as of the simulation date 
deposit cash flows include federal reserve bank estimates of operating costs for each deposit type 
the table below shows the effect on equity of market value changes of the company s financial assets and liabilities if interest rates change immediately up or down by or basis points as of december  rate scenario percentage change in eve rates increase basis points rates increase basis points rates decrease basis points rates decrease basis points the company s policy sets limits on allowable change in the economic value of equity if rates rise or fall by basis points 
percentage changes noted in the table above are within these limits 
since the market value of the company s equity would increase with rising interest rates  this table again indicates the company is slightly asset sensitive 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity gap the table below presents the company s balance sheet with estimated repricing information as of december  it indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets repricing during the first year 
it should be noted that transaction deposits interest bearing demand deposits  savings and mmda comprise the major portion of these liabilities  and changes in rates on these deposits often occur after changes to key index rates on loans 
repricing interval in thousands months months years over years non rate sensitive total assets overnight interest bearing deposits with other banks securities loans and loans held for sale  gross noninterest earning assets total assets liabilities and shareholders equity interest bearing demand deposits savings and mmda time deposits fhlb advances other borrowings and capital lease obligations junior subordinated debt noninterest bearing liabilities and shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity interest rate repricing gap cumulative repricing gap cumulative gap as a of total earning assets
