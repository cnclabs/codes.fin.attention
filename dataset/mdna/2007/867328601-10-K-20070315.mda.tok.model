item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including but not limited to those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
all forward looking statements included in this report are based on information available to us on the date of this report  and we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements contained in this report 
overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel small molecule therapeutics for oncology and other unmet medical needs 
we have developed a proprietary fragment based drug discovery approach  called tethering  that we combine with other drug discovery tools  such as structure based design and medicinal chemistry  to discover and develop novel therapeutics 
we have built our product candidate portfolio through internal discovery and the in licensing of novel cancer therapeutics 
we are advancing our product candidates through in house research and development efforts and strategic collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies 
from our incorporation in through  our operations consisted primarily of developing and refining our drug discovery technologies 
since  we have focused on developing novel small molecule drugs mainly to treat cancer and other unmet medical needs 
we are advancing three proprietary oncology product candidates  sns  sns and sns  through in house research and development efforts 
our lead product candidate  sns  is a novel cell cycle inhibitor 
with sns  we are currently conducting one phase clinical trial in small cell lung cancer  one phase clinical trial in ovarian cancer and one phase clinical trial in acute leukemias 
our second most advanced product candidate  sns  is a cdk inhibitor 
we are currently conducting a phase clinical trial with sns in patients with advanced solid tumors and a phase clinical trial in patients with advanced b cell malignancies 
we are also developing sns  an aurora kinase inhibitor  for the treatment of cancer for which we filed an ind in february we have worldwide development and commercialization rights to sns  sns for diagnostic and therapeutic applications and sns we may in the future enter into collaborations to maximize the commercial potential of these programs 
as of february   we had four ongoing strategic collaborations  one of which involves active participation by our personnel  with three leading pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies 
as of december   we had received an aggregate of approximately million in cash from our current and former collaboration partners in the form of stock purchase proceeds and fees from our current and former collaboration partners 
since our inception  we have generated significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million  including a deemed dividend of million recorded in conjunction with our ipo in september we expect our net losses to increase primarily due to our anticipated clinical trial activities 
financial operations overview revenue we have not generated any revenue from sales of commercial products and do not expect to generate any product revenue for the foreseeable future 
to date  our revenue has consisted of collaboration revenue and grant and fellowship revenue 
collaboration revenue 
we generate revenue primarily through our collaborations 
as of february   we had four ongoing research based collaborations  one of which involves the participation of our personnel 
each of these collaborations included a technology access fee  research funding  milestone payments and royalties upon sales of future products that may result from the collaborations 
the table below sets forth our revenue since january  from each of our current collaborators 
year ended december  in thousands biogen idec a related party johnson johnson prd merck total in may  we entered into our collaboration with johnson johnson prd  the research phase of which was completed in december in december  we entered into our initial collaboration with biogen idec  the research phase of which was completed in june in february  we entered into our initial collaboration with merck  the research phase of which was completed in february in july  we entered into a second collaboration with merck 
in august  we entered into a second collaboration with biogen idec 
in and  we expect to receive additional research funding from our collaborators totaling at least million 
this funding is discretionary  but is not dependent upon the achievement of milestones 
in addition  we may receive milestone payments if one or more of our research collaboration programs reach a milestone for which a payment is due 
in  milestone payments earned totaled million 
in the absence of any new collaborations  we expect our collaboration revenue to be lower in future years than in grant and fellowship revenue 
grant and fellowship revenue is recognized as we perform services under the applicable grant 
as of december   we had been awarded an aggregate of million  and had recognized as revenue million  in federal grants under the small business innovation research  or sbir  program 
in addition  we have recognized revenue from other grants and fellowships 
grant and fellowship revenues recognized were   and  for the periods ended december    and  respectively 
we do not plan to perform any work under additional sbir grants in the foreseeable future 
research and development expense most of our operating expenses to date have been for research and development activities 
research and development expense represents costs incurred to discover and develop novel small molecule therapeutics  including phase and phase clinical trial costs for sns and phase clinical trial costs for sns  to develop our proprietary fragment based tethering drug discovery approach  to develop in house research and preclinical study capabilities  to discover and advance product candidates toward clinical trials  including our sns aurora kinase program  and in connection with in licensing activities 
we expense all research and development costs as they are incurred 
the table below sets forth our research and development expense since january  for our product candidate programs 
year ended december  in thousands sns sns sns raf kinase inhibitors other kinase inhibitors cathepsin s inhibitors bace inhibitors for alzheimer s disease anti viral inhibitors tnf family and oncology research other programs total we in licensed sns from bristol myers squibb company  or bms  in april and issued bms shares of our series c preferred stock  with an initial value of million 
these shares were converted into  shares of common stock in conjunction with our ipo in september the million up front payment was included in research and development expense for the period ended december  due to uncertainties surrounding the remaining efforts for completion of the research and development activities 
in february  as consideration for a milestone payment due pursuant to the license agreement for initiating a phase clinical trial  we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to bms and recorded a non cash research and development expense of million 
we incur research and development expense associated with both partnered and unpartnered research activities  as well as the development and expansion of our drug discovery technologies 
research and development expense relating to our collaborations with biogen idec and merck consist primarily of costs related to tethering  lead optimization  preclinical studies and other activities related to the identification and optimization of compounds for development of kinase inhibitors for the treatment of cancer  cytokine and enzyme inhibitors for the treatment of inflammatory diseases  antiviral inhibitors for the treatment of viral disease as well as protease inhibitors for the treatment of alzheimer s disease 
under our biogen idec agreement  we have an option on a target by target basis to co fund post phase development costs for up to two oncology kinase targets  which may include raf kinase 
if we exercise one or both of our options  our research and development expense will increase significantly 
research and development expense related to co development activities that we elect to co fund would consist primarily of manufacturing costs for the product candidate  clinical trial related costs  costs for consultants and contract research employee compensation and facilities costs and depreciation of equipment 
we expect to incur research and development expense to conduct clinical trials on sns  sns and sns clinical trials are costly  and as we continue to advance our product candidates through preclinical and clinical development  we expect our research and development expense to increase 
for example  we expect to spend at least million to advance our sns program to completion of phase clinical trials in small cell lung cancer and ovarian cancer and ongoing and planned phase and phase clinical trials in acute leukemias  to advance our sns program to completion of our ongoing and planned phase clinical trials  and to complete a phase clinical trial for sns as of the date of this report  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early state of development of our programs  we are unable to estimate the costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates for potential commercialization 
due to these same factors  we are unable to determine the anticipated completion dates for our current research and development programs 
clinical development timelines  probability of success and development costs vary widely 
while we are currently focused on advancing sns  sns and sns through clinical development  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate  as well as an ongoing assessment as to the product candidate s commercial potential 
in addition  we cannot forecast which product candidates will be subject to future collaborative or licensing arrangements  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
as a result  we do not know when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from our product candidates 
general and administrative expense our general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in finance  human resources  facilities management  legal  including intellectual property management  general administration and non cash stock compensation 
other significant costs include facilities costs and fees paid to outside legal advisors and auditors 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf   accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which we adopted effective july   revenue arrangements with multiple deliverable items are divided into separate units of accounting based on whether certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
we allocate the consideration we receive among the separate units of accounting based on their respective fair value  and we apply the applicable revenue recognition criteria to each of the separate units 
where an item in a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables does not constitute a separate unit of accounting and for which delivery has not occurred  we defer revenue until the delivery of the item is completed 
we record upfront  non refundable license fees and other fees received in connection with research and development collaborations as deferred revenue and recognize these amounts ratably over the relevant period specified in the agreements  generally the research term 
we recognize research funding related to collaborative research with our collaboration partners as the related research services are performed 
this funding is normally based on a specified amount per full time equivalent employee per year 
we recognize revenue from milestone payments  which are substantially at risk at the time the collaboration agreement is entered into  upon completion of the applicable milestone events 
we intend to recognize any future royalty revenue based on reported product sales by third party licensees 
we recognize grant revenue from government agencies and private research foundations as the related qualified research and development costs are incurred  up to the limit of the prior approval funding amounts 
clinical trial accounting we record accruals for estimated clinical trial costs  comprising payments for work performed by contract research organizations and participating clinical trial sites 
these costs may be a significant component of future research and development expense 
we accrue costs for clinical trials performed by contract research organizations based on estimates of work performed under the contracts 
costs of setting up clinical trial sites for participation in trials are expensed immediately 
costs related to patient enrollment are accrued as patients are entered in the trial reduced by an initial payment made to the hospital when the first patient is enrolled 
these cost estimates may or may not match the actual costs incurred for services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may underestimate costs associated with various trials at a given point in time 
although our experience in estimating these costs is limited  the difference between accrued expenses based on our estimates and actual expenses have not been material to date 
stock based payments the company grant options to purchase common stock to its employees  directors and consultants under its stock option plans 
eligible employees can also purchase shares of common stock at of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning of an offering period or at the purchase date 
the company account for stock compensation arrangements to non employees in accordance with eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  using a fair value approach 
the compensation costs of these arrangements are subject to remeasurement over the vesting terms as earned 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment fas r  which supersedes the previous accounting under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under fas r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period 
the company has no awards with market or performance conditions 
the company adopted the provisions of fas r using the modified prospective transition method for awards granted on or after december   the date on which the company filed its initial registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission sec in connection with its ipo 
the prospective transition method has been applied to options granted prior to december  under the modified prospective transition method  compensation cost recognized during the year ended december   includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to the initial filing of the company s form s on december   but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
as defined below and amortized on a straight line basis over the options vesting period  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r amortized on a straight line basis over the options vesting period 
under the prospective transition method  options granted prior to the initial filing of the company s form s will continue to be accounted for in accordance with apb and financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb no 
 which were the accounting principles originally applied to those awards 
the valuation provisions of fas r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and subsequently modified or cancelled 
estimated compensation expense for awards outstanding at the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the statement of operations for fiscal is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
fas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the company reviewed its forfeiture estimates on a quarterly basis during in the company s pro forma information required under sfas for the periods prior to fiscal  the company accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
the company s financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of fas r 
upon adoption of fas r  the company retained its method of valuation for share based awards granted beginning in fiscal with the use of the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model which was previously used for the company s pro forma information required under sfas the company s determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the company s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
fas r requires the cash flows resulting from the tax benefits related to tax deductions in excess of the compensation costs recognized for these options excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows 
on november   the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards 
the company has elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects of share based compensation pursuant to fas r 
the alternative transition method includes a simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool related to the tax effects of employee share based compensation  which is available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of fas r 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue 
revenue decreased from million in to million in collaboration revenue decreased from million in to million in  primarily due to a million decrease in collaboration revenue from biogen idec and a million decrease in collaboration revenue from johnson johnson prd 
the decrease in collaboration revenue from biogen idec and johnson johnson prd resulted from the completion of the research phase of collaborations with these companies in grant and fellowship revenue decreased from  in to  in  primarily due to our decision in to only perform limited additional work under sbir grants for the foreseeable future 
research and development expense 
research and development expense decreased from million in to million in  primarily due to a million expense related to the in license of sns in april versus a million milestone payment paid for sns in without these non cash licensing and milestone related expenses for sns  research and development expenses increased from million in to million in primarily due to i a million increase in expenses related to the development of sns  ii a million increase in expense related to the development of sns  adjusted for licensing fees and milestone payments  iii a million increase in expense associated with other kinase programs  and iv million increase in expense related to other programs  partially offset by a million decrease in expenses associated with our sns aurora kinase programs and a million decrease in expense related to our bace inhibitor research collaboration with merck

research and development expense associated with sns  our aurora kinase inhibitors program  decreased from million in to million in due to a reduced number of research employees working on this program partially offset by increased outside services expense related to toxicology studies 
research and development expense for all other programs increased from million in to million in due to an increase in expense related to other kinase inhibitor programs 
research and development expense in included a million non cash stock based compensation expense due to the adoption of fas r 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in  including a million expense related to the adoption of fas r in the increase is primarily due to i a  increase in employee related expenses  and a  increase in non cash stock based compensation expense  ii a million increase in professional services expenses including expenses related to managing our intellectual property portfolio and management s testing of internal control for financial reporting  and iii a  increase in other expenses  including costs for directors and officers liability insurance and facilities costs 
interest income and expense 
interest income increased from million in to million in  primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest expense decreased from  in to  in  primarily due to a reduction in average debt outstanding in compared to  partially offset by higher average interest rate on outstanding debt obligations in than in years ended december  and revenue

interest expense increased from  in to  in  primarily due to a higher average interest rate on outstanding debt obligations and an increase in average debt outstanding in compared to income taxes since inception  we have incurred operating losses and  accordingly  have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of million and million  respectively 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of million 
if not utilized  the federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning in utilization of the net operating loss and tax credits carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  that are applicable if the company experiences an ownership change  which may occur  for example  as a result of the company s initial public offering and other sales of the company s stock  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and outstanding equipment financing and debt obligations of million

in  we also received net proceeds of approximately  from sale of equity to employees through our employee stock purchase plan and approximately  from sale of equity under our stock option plans 
since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of common and preferred stock  research funding and technology access fees from our collaboration partners  research grants  loans from biogen idec and other debt financings

the net cash provided by financing activities in primarily resulted from net proceeds of million from the public offering of common stock completed in september  offset by the payments of million on note payable and equipment loans 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  which primarily resulted from the issuance of preferred stock and indebtedness incurred under our collaboration with biogen idec 
credit and loan arrangements in june  we entered into an equipment financing agreement with general electric capital corporation  which has been amended from time to time 
the credit facility was available through may as of june   we had outstanding million to finance equipment purchases and leasehold improvements 
in august  we entered into a new million credit facility with general electric capital corporation and this credit facility was available through february  the equipment loans are secured by the equipment financed 
outstanding borrowings bear interest at annual rates ranging from to  and are payable over to months 
in connection with the original credit facility  we issued in june a warrant to purchase shares of series c preferred stock  which was converted into a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price per share of upon our ipo  and in june  a warrant to purchase shares of series c preferred stock  which was converted to a warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price per share of upon our ipo 
the warrants expire in june and june  respectively 
in connection with the credit facility in august  we issued a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price per share of 
as of december   the outstanding balance under this debt facility was million 
in december  we executed a promissory note in favor of biogen idec for an aggregate principal amount of up to million 
under the promissory note  we had a drawdown period of ten calendar quarters beginning on april  and ending on june  the principal and accrued interest of each draw were due five years from the date of advance of each draw and bear interest at above libor to be paid quarterly 
as of june   we had drawn million and the facility was fully drawn 
we used a portion of our net proceeds from our initial public offering to repay our outstanding indebtedness to biogen idec in full 
in august  we entered into a venture loan and security agreement with oxford finance corporation and horizon technology funding company llc  pursuant to which we may borrow up to million 
the full million loan commitment was available until october   million was available until january   and the remaining million was available until may  we had not borrowed any monies under this loan facility and this facility has expired 
in conjunction with this transaction  we issued warrants to the lenders to purchase  shares of common stock at a price of per share  half of which are currently exercisable 
none of the remaining warrants will vest or become exercisable 
we also granted the lenders registration rights under our eighth amended and restated investor rights agreement 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the future 
we will not receive any product revenue until a product candidate has been approved by the fda or similar regulatory agencies in other countries and successfully commercialized 
we currently anticipate that our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and available credit facilities  together with revenue generated from our collaborations  will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through the middle of however  we will need to raise substantial additional funds to continue our operations and bring future products to market 
we cannot be certain that any of our programs will be successful or that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to complete the development and commercialize any of our product candidates currently in development  should they succeed 
additionally  we plan to continue to evaluate in licensing and acquisition opportunities to gain access to new drugs or drug targets that would fit with our strategy 
any such transaction would likely increase our funding needs in the future 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials  preclinical studies and other discovery and research and development activities  the costs associated with establishing manufacturing and commercialization capabilities  the costs of acquiring or investing in businesses  product candidates and technologies  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of seeking and obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the economic and other terms and timing of any collaboration  licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter 
until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements  which we may never do  we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or strategic collaborations 
we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and development programs 
in addition  we may have to partner one or more of our product candidate programs at an earlier stage of development  which would lower the economic value of those programs to our company 
contractual obligations the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations and the periods in which payments are due as of december  in thousands payment due by period total less than year years years more than years equipment financing operating lease obligations total the contractual summary above reflects only payment obligations that are fixed and determinable 
we have additional contractual payments obligations that are contingent on future events 
our operating lease obligations relate to the lease for our two headquarters facilities in south san francisco  california 
in december  we leased approximately  square feet of additional office space in a building near to our main office in south san francisco  california 
this lease expires in april  subject to our option to extend the lease through february the lease provides for  in lease payments in   in and   in and  and  thereafter 
we also have agreements with clinical sites  and contract research organizations for the conduct of our clinical trials 
we make payments to these sites and organizations based upon the number of patients enrolled and the period of follow up in the trials 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
under fin a company would recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
fin clarifies how a company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized  provides guidance as to the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits 
fin also addresses when a company should record interest and penalties related to tax positions and how the interest and penalties may be classified within the income statement and presented in the balance sheet 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and is required to be adopted by the company effective january  the cumulative effects  if any  of applying fin will be recorded as an adjustment to accumulated deficit as of the beginning of the period of adoption 
the company is currently evaluating fin and its possible impacts on the company s financial statements and is not yet in a position to determine such effects  if any 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab no 
provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining whether the current year s financial statements are materially misstated 
sab no 
is effective for fiscal years ending on or after november  the adoption of sab no 
did not have material impact on our financial position or results of operations for the year ended december  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  including structured finance  special purpose or variable interest entities 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve these objectives  our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds and corporate debt securities 
our cash and cash equivalents as of december  included liquid money market accounts 
our marketable securities as of december  included readily marketable debt securities 
due to the short term nature of these instruments  a movement in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on the total value of our portfolio as of december  the following table summarizes the expected maturity and average interest rate of our marketable securities at december  year ending december  thereafter total fair value at december  marketable securities average interest rate
