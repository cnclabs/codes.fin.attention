application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company s accounting policies that affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
management has discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with the board of directors and audit committee 
revenue recognition revenues consist of product and service revenues and are recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition 
product revenues are recognized upon shipment  provided fees are fixed and determinable  a customer purchase order is obtained when applicable  and collection is probable 
revenues from reseller arrangements are recognized when the product is sold through to the end customer unless an established return history 
table of contents supports recognizing revenue upon shipment  less a provision for estimated sales returns 
sales tax collected from customers and remitted to the applicable taxing authorities is accounted for on a net basis  with no impact to revenues 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
deferred revenue consists primarily of revenue from service revenue 
warranty reserve the company offers to its customers a limited warranty that its products will be free from defect in the materials and workmanship for a specified period 
the company has established a warranty reserve  as a component of accrued liabilities  for any potential claims 
the company estimates its warranty reserve based upon an analysis of all identified or expected claims and an estimate of the cost to resolve those claims 
changes in claim rates and differences between actual and expected warranty costs could impact the warranty reserve estimates 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the company records accounts receivable at their net realizable value and management is required to estimate the collectibility of the company s trade receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables  including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
management evaluates all accounts periodically and a reserve is established based on the best facts available to management and reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the reserves also are determined by using percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories based on historical results 
allowance for returns the company estimates its allowance for returns based upon expected return rates 
the estimates of expected return rates are generally a factor of historical returns 
changes in return rates could impact allowance for return estimates 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and include material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis 
valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market involves an inherent level of risk and uncertainty due to technology trends in the industry and customer demand for our products 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  management is required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels 
reserve requirements generally increase as projected demand requirements decrease due to market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes as well as longer than previously expected usage periods 
the company has experienced significant changes in required reserves in the past due to changes in strategic direction  such as discontinuances of product lines as well as declining market conditions 
it is possible that significant changes in this estimate may occur in the future as market conditions change 
long lived assets property and equipment and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
such determination is made in accordance with the applicable generally accepted accounting principles gaap requirements associated with the long lived asset  and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
adverse changes in such estimates could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future 
all impairments are recognized in operating results when a permanent reduction in value occurs 

table of contents derivative financial instruments and hedging all derivative instruments are recorded as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are either recorded in income or other comprehensive income  as appropriate 
the gain or loss on derivatives that have not been designated as hedging instruments is included in current income in the period that changes in fair value occur

the decrease in research and development costs as a percentage of total revenue is due to revenue increasing at a greater rate than research and development expense 
we anticipate that spending on research and development will continue to increase slightly in the near future as we continue to fund our project related research and development activities  subject to the fluctuations in currency and exchange rates because much of our development expense is associated with our engineering lab in france see item a foreign currency risk

additionally  fin provides guidance on the recognition  classification  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
the accounting provisions of fin were effective for the company beginning january  the company does not anticipate that the adoption of fin no 
 as it is applied to us income taxes  will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
the company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of fin no 
 as it is applied to foreign income taxes  will have on its consolidated financial statements 
in september  the sec staff issued sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab no 
was issued to provide consistency between how registrants quantify financial statement misstatements 
historically  there have been two widely used methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements  the roll over method and the iron curtain method 
while the roll over method primarily quantifies the amount by which the current year income statement is misstated  the iron curtain method primarily quantifies the error as the cumulative amount by which the current year balance sheet is misstated 
sab no 
establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatement on each of the company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this approach is commonly referred to as the dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the roll over and iron curtain methods 
the company adopted sab on december  and did not record an adjustment as a result of its adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency risk we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because we conduct business on a global basis and in some cases in foreign currencies 
our operations in france are measured in the local currency and converted into us dollars based on published exchange rates for the periods reported and are therefore subject to risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
the euro to us dollar translation accounted for charges of approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in an attempt to mitigate the risk described above  we may enter into  from time to time  foreign exchange contracts to purchase a fixed amount of euros on a fixed date in the future at a fixed rate determined at the contract date 
these derivative financial instruments do not meet the criteria to qualify as hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and therefore any changes in the market value of these contracts are recognized as a gain or loss in the period of the change 
for the year ended december   we recognized a gain of approximately  related to these foreign exchange contracts 
for the year ended december  we recognized a loss of approximately  related to these foreign exchange contracts 
at december  we had three foreign exchange contracts outstanding to acquire approximately million euros for each contract on 
table of contents specified dates during the next seven months 
at december   we carried a  asset on the balance sheet  classified as other current assets  related to the fair value of our outstanding foreign exchange contracts 
there were five such contracts outstanding at december   classified as a  liability on the balance sheet 
market price risk we had no equity hedge contracts outstanding as of december   or interest rate risk our investments are subject to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that the company s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected due to movements in interest rates 
we invest our cash in a variety of interest earning financial instruments  including bank time deposits  money market funds  and variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations and national governmental entities and agencies 
due to the demand nature of our money market funds and the short term nature of our time deposits and debt securities portfolio  these assets are particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we manage this risk through investments with shorter term maturities and varying maturity dates 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate decrease of less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  this potential change is based on sensitivity analyses performed on our marketable securities at december  actual results may differ materially 
the same hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate decrease of less than  in the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  our credit facility bears interest at a variable rate tied to the london interbank offered rate libor 
the current interest rate on our credit facility is libor 
in an attempt to mitigate interest rate fluctuations  we from time to time may enter into agreements with our lender to fix the interest rate  our agreement at december  expired on february  it was subsequently renewed for a day period at the same rate 
a hypothetical basis point increase in libor would increase annual interest expense on this credit facility by approximately
