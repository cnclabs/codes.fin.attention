item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements  the notes to those financial statements and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this document 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this document contain forward looking statements that reflect plans  estimates  intentions  expectations and beliefs 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
see note regarding forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those set forth in the risk factors in item a and contained elsewhere in this form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates our estimates and assumptions including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition  asset impairments  inventory valuation  warranty reserves and other assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
although we have shipped products and recorded contract revenues  our operations have not yet reached a level that would qualify us to emerge from the development stage 
therefore we continue to be accounted for as a development stage company under statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting and reporting by development stage enterprises 
we recognize revenues in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
generally  revenue is recognized on transfer of title  typically when products are shipped and all related costs are estimable 
for sales to distributors  we make an adjustment to defer revenue until products are subsequently sold by distributors to their customers 
government contract revenue recognized on the percentage of completion method 
we recognize contract revenues using the percentage of completion method  based primarily on contract costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
changes to total estimated contract costs or losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed are classified as current assets  and included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our balance sheets 
amounts billed to clients in excess of revenues recognized to date are classified as current liabilities under advance billings on contracts 
changes in project performance and conditions  estimated profitability  and final contract settlements may result in future revisions to construction contract costs and revenue 
all of our research and development contracts are subject to cost review by the respective agencies 
our reported results from these contracts could change adversely as a result of these reviews 
loss on contract commitments 
each quarter  we perform an evaluation of expected costs to complete our in progress contracts that we account for using the percentage of completion method 
in the event that the total expected costs to complete a contract exceed the expected total contract revenue  we immediately record a loss on the contract to the extent that the expected loss exceeds the expected revenue from the contract 
inventory valuation 
we value our inventory at the lower of actual cost or the current estimated market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage for the prior twelve month period and future sales forecasts 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and thus our reported operating results 
for the years ended december   and  reserves were recorded to fully offset the value of our inventory 
these impairment charges were made due to the uncertainty of realizing any future value from the inventory due to the lack of substantial revenues to date from our inverter product line 
materials used in the development of the smart energy flywheel and our other development efforts are considered research and development materials  and are expensed as incurred in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for research and development costs 
patent costs 
we will capitalize external legal costs incurred in the defense of our patents where we believe that the future economic benefit of the patent will be increased 
we monitor the legal costs incurred and the anticipated outcome of the legal action and  if changes in the anticipated outcome occur  capitalized costs will be adjusted in the period the change is determined 
patent costs are amortized over the remaining life of the patents 
we own intellectual property in the form of patents on our flywheel vacuum system  our heat pipe cooling systems  dc output paralleling  metal hub  low loss motor  co mingled rims and earthquake tolerant bearings on our flywheel products  and anti islanding software  drawings  source code  and production know how on our inverter products  and expect to obtain other patents during and beyond 
these costs were being amortized during  but we recorded impairment charges to write down these assets to zero on the balance sheet at december  these impairment charges were made due to the uncertainty of realizing any future value from this property mainly due the lack of substantial revenues to date 
accordingly  all costs incurred during and related to the development of intellectual property have also been expensed as incurred 
warranty reserves 
our warranties require us to repair or replace defective products returned to us during the applicable warranty period at no cost to the customer 
we record an estimate for warranty related costs based on actual historical return rates  anticipated return rates and repair costs at the time of sale 
a significant increase in product return rates  or a significant increase in the costs to repair products  could have a material adverse impact on future operating results for the period or periods in which such returns or additional costs materialize and thereafter 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty associated with their ultimate realization 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance or reduce our current valuation allowance which could materially impact our tax provision 
long lived assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets long lived assets we hold and use are reviewed to determine whether any events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the conditions to be considered include whether or not the asset is in service  has become obsolete  is damaged  or whether external market circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when appropriate we recognize a loss for the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset and the carrying amount 
the fair value of the asset is measured using either available market prices or estimated discounted cash flows 
our analyses indicate that there was an impairment of certain long lived assets as a result of the december prototype malfunction  and we recognized an asset impairment charge of approximately  in this represents the estimated cost to repair certain damaged items 
based on our annual analysis  no asset impairment charges were considered necessary for or overview our initial product strategy was to develop high energy  composite flywheels for back up powering of telecommunications applications 
with the collapse of the telecommunications market which began in  we recognized that our smart energy flywheel products as alternative backup solutions to the telecommunications industry were not a means to produce meaningful revenues 
with that recognition  we initiated a series of cost cutting measures throughout and the focus of these efforts was to reduce cash usage while preserving our intellectual properties and maintaining the integrity of our public company requirements while evaluating all potential product markets for our technologies and considering acquisitions or mergers that could lead to increased shareholder value 
we have i identified promising applications for our smart energy matrix design in the electric utility power grid marketplace 
ii pursued additional development and design contracts for a variety of applications by federal agencies 
we have been successful in obtaining contracts and are continuing our efforts to obtain additional research and development funding 
iii field tested scale model smart energy matrix flywheel systems for frequency regulation in two states  which has resulted in certification of our technology for frequency regulation in the state of california 
in march  nyserda and the us doe determined that the test of our second demonstration system in new york was also a success and that no further data acquisition or testing was required 
this milestone has set the stage for us to become a fully qualified market participant should we decide to commercialize our technology in new york 
iv completed a significant portion of the development effort for our smart energy flywheel in we must raise additional funds to execute our business plan 
although funding of approximately million was raised in february  based on our rate of expenditure of cash and the additional expenditures expected to support our business plan we estimate that we have sufficient cash to fund operations into approximately the fourth quarter of we need to obtain additional investments in to fund our continuation as a going concern ongoing research and development of the smart energy flywheel and the smart energy matrix multi flywheel system the ramp up of our manufacturing and assembly capacity the design and build out of facilities to provide frequency regulation services to the electricity grid working capital requirements  and the identification and development of new business opportunities 
we are continuing to develop the smart energy flywheel  which is the core component of the smart energy matrix flywheel system 
in order to complete development of the smart energy matrix flywheel system  build  operate and receive fees for frequency regulation services of at least one megawatt from a commercial sized flywheel based frequency regulation system and have sufficient working capital to continue to execute our business plan through  we will need to raise approximately million of funding 
also  we will need to raise additional amounts beyond the foregoing million to finance the various additional frequency regulation facilities that are contemplated by our business plan 
as part of our new business development  we may evaluate possible acquisitions of enterprises or technologies that we would consider synergistic from a market  technology or product perspective 
from inception through december   we have incurred losses of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur losses as we expand our product development and begin to increase our manufacturing capacity 
revenues 
we were awarded fixed price research and development contracts from government agencies and are pursuing similar contracts from other government agencies 
we have determined that we will recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method for such contracts 
we are continuing to evaluate markets for our flywheel systems but we have not recognized revenues from these products 
we have placed development prototype flywheels with potential customers and shipped pre production units 
these flywheel products were provided to potential customers without charge or on a demonstration basis to allow us access to field test information and to demonstrate the application of our technologies 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold on fixed price research and development contracts are predominantly being recorded on the percentage of completion method and consist primarily of direct labor and material  subcontracting and associated overhead costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits for sales and marketing personnel and related business development expenses 
in we expanded our sales and marketing effort into the renewable energy market for the smart power m inverter product 
we continue to rely on engineering personnel to provide technical specifications and product overviews to our potential customer base 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase as we expand efforts to define new markets for our products 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits related to our corporate staff  professional fees  insurance and travel 
in we incurred significant non recurring professional expenses relating to the failed attempt to acquire nxtphase t d corporation and our fundraising efforts 
in  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased  primarily due to compensation costs associated with equity based compensation 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase slightly in over due primarily to the implementation and reporting expenses associated with compliance with the internal control provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  fundraising activities  and marketing  sales and business development expenses related to the smart energy matrix 
research and development 
our cost of research and development consists primarily of the cost of compensation and benefits for research and development  staffing  as well as materials and supplies used in the engineering design and development process 
these costs are expected to increase in as compared to as we complete the development and testing of the smart energy flywheel and the design of the smart energy matrix and frequency regulation facility 
loss on contract commitments 
we will establish reserves for anticipated losses on contract commitments if  based on cost estimates to complete the commitment  we determine that a loss will be incurred 
we recorded a million charge during and million in for anticipated losses on our research and development contracts 
we did not accrue such losses during we are most likely to recognize probable losses on contract commitments early in a product s introduction prior to being able to realize expected decreases in cost per unit through engineering design changes  operating efficiencies  and volume purchasing discounts 
on government contracts  we will  on a quarterly basis  evaluate our estimated costs to complete and establish reserves when appropriate 
restructuring and asset impairment charges 
we did not recognize any material restructuring charges in  or asset impairment charges of approximately  were recorded in related to damages resulting from the prototype malfunction in december depreciation and amortization 
our depreciation and amortization is primarily related to depreciation on capital expenditures and the amortization of lease and leasehold costs related to our facilities 
we have intellectual property in the form of patents on our flywheel vacuum system  our heat pipe cooling systems  dc output paralleling  metal hub  low loss motor  co mingled rims and earthquake tolerant bearings on our flywheel products  and anti islanding software  drawings  source code  and production know how on our smart power m inverter system  and expect to obtain other patents during and beyond 
these costs were being amortized during  but we recorded impairment charges to write down these assets to zero on the balance sheet at december  these impairment charges were made due to the uncertainty of realizing any future value from this property mainly due the lack of substantial revenues to date 
accordingly  all costs incurred during and related to the development of intellectual property have been expensed as incurred 
interest and other income expense  net 
in  non operating income consists primarily of interest income resulting from cash on hand  and approximately  received in settlement of a class action suit relating to unfair practices engaged in by certain insurance brokerage firms 
in and  our non operating income and expenses are primarily attributable to realized gains on the sale of our available for sale securities and a warrant  a write back resulting from loan payments on a reserved loan to a former officer of the company  a cash settlement relating to our failed attempt to acquire nxtphase t d corporation  interest income resulting from cash on hand  accrued dividends receivable and the conversion premium from the conversion of our holdings of series a preferred stock of evergreen solar  inc  partially offset by interest expense associated with our capital leases 
accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting pronouncements share based payments during the first quarter of  we adopted the provisions of  and accounted for  stock based compensation in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r  share based payment 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r  we also adopted sec staff accounting bulletin sab  which provides additional guidance on disclosure topics related to share based payments 
under the fair value recognition requirements of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense as it is earned over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
to implement this standard  we elected the modified prospective transition method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
the valuation provisions of sfas r apply to new grants and to grants that were outstanding as of the effective date and are subsequently modified 
estimated compensation expense for grants that were outstanding as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining vesting period using the compensation cost estimated for the sfas pro forma disclosures 
the adoption of sfas r had a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our stock based compensation assumptions and expenses  including pro forma disclosures for prior periods as if we had recorded stock based compensation expense during such periods 
accounting changes and error corrections during the first quarter of  we also adopted sfas no 
accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no  which became effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle 
when a pronouncement includes specific transition guidance  those provisions should be followed 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
there have been no accounting changes or error corrections required since our adoption of this pronouncement that required retroactive restatements 
inventory costs in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
we adopted sfas no 
in however  due to our lack of substantial revenues from our inverter product line and the uncertainty of any future value  our inventory is fully reserved 
materials used in our research and development effort are expensed as incurred 
therefore  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
correcting prior year errors in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  which became effective for fiscal years ending after november  sab no 
requires that companies utilize a dual approach to assessing the quantitative effects of financial statements misstatements 
the dual approach includes both an income statement focused and balance sheet focused assessment 
to date  implementation of this guidance has not had any significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
accounting for registration payment arrangements in december   the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
eitf  accounting for registration payment arrangements 
this staff position  which is in effect immediately  specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment arrangement should be separately recognized and measured in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
since we currently have an active registration statement on file with the sec  any agreement related to equity raising activity would need to be evaluated according to the terms of this staff position 
although there is no current impact on our results of operations or financial obligation  it is possible that these requirements could have an impact on future financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements and regulations fair value measurements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which enhances existing guidance for measuring assets and liabilities at fair value 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies to other accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements  it does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements for fiscal year ends beginning after november   which will be the first quarter of our fiscal year 
we do not expect this statement will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
accounting for tax uncertainties in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of statement no 
this statement addresses uncertainty in tax positions recognized in a company s financial statements and stipulates a minimum recognition threshold and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin applies to fiscal years beginning after december   and thus will apply to our first fiscal quarter of we are still assessing the impact that fin no 
will have on our results of operations  financial positions  or cash flows  but currently  we do not expect the impact to be material

we expect to make significant expenditures to fund our operations  develop technologies and explore opportunities to find and develop additional markets to sell our products 
in previous years  we took significant actions to reduce our cash expenditures for product development  infrastructure and production readiness by significantly reducing headcount  development spending and capital expenditures 
however  as we near completion of development of the smart energy matrix and prepare to begin commercial activity aimed at revenue generation in  we have begun to increase our headcount  and have spent additional funds on expense materials  capital equipment and market analyses to understand the size of markets  competitive aspects and advantages that our products could provide

as part of our new business development  we may evaluate possible acquisitions of enterprises or technologies that we consider synergistic from a market  technology or product perspective 
we may make investments in companies for strategic business reasons 
because our primary motivation in making these investments may not be to realize a profit on the investment itself  but rather to expand our business prospects  these investments may lack any financial return to the company and may result in a loss of principal and may impair our liquidity 
the following table summarizes our commitments at december  year ended december  description of commitment thereafter total operating leases purchase obligations total commitments the amounts listed for operating leases represent payments for the occupancy of our principal executive offices  laboratory and manufacturing facilities located in wilmington  massachusetts
