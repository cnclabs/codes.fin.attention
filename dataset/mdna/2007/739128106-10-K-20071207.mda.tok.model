risk factors contained in this annual report 
overview we develop  design  manufacture and service custom engineered to order equipment and systems for the management and control of electrical energy and other critical processes 
headquartered in houston  texas  we serve the transportation  environmental  energy  industrial and utility industries 
our business operations are consolidated into two business segments electrical power products and process control systems 
effective september   we changed our fiscal year end from october to september we have not restated prior year financial statements to conform to the new fiscal year as we do not believe the results would be materially different because our operations and cash flows do not fluctuate on a seasonal basis and the change in fiscal year end was only days 
therefore  our consolidated operating results and cash flows for the year ended september   are compared to the operating results and cash flows for the months ended september  on august   we purchased certain assets related to the ansi medium voltage switchgear and circuit breaker business of ge s consumer industrial unit 
the operating results of the power vac product line are included from that date and are included in our electrical power products business segment 
the power vac medium voltage switchgear product line enhances our product offering  comes with a large installed base and has a broad customer base across utility  industrial and commercial markets 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into a year supply agreement with ge in which ge is obligated to purchase from powell subject to limited conditions for exceptions all of its requirements for ansi medium voltage switchgear and circuit breakers and other related equipment and components 
the power vac product line  together with our long term commercial alliance with ge  is expected to significantly strengthen our position in the marketplace and should enable us to reach a broader market and gain access to new customers 
we are currently relocating the power vac product line from ge s facility in west burlington  iowa  to our facilities in houston  texas 
the relocation of the product line and related activities is expected to be completed in the first half of fiscal year ge will continue to manufacture products and supply them to powell during the transition period 
overall  we continue to experience strong market demand for our products and services 
pricing in our markets has improved in conjunction with the overall increase in business activity 
we believe this increase was a result of the petrochemical and utility markets entering into a new investment cycle 
customer inquiries  or requests for proposals  have steadily strengthened throughout fiscal years and this increase in customer inquiries led to increased orders in fiscal year and  accordingly  a very strong backlog of orders continuing into fiscal year results of operations twelve months ended september  fiscal compared to eleven months ended september  fiscal revenue and gross profit consolidated revenues increased million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenues increased primarily due to general market recovery  concerted sales efforts and the acquisition of the power vac product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal the power vac product line added revenues of million in fiscal domestic revenues increased by to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal international revenues were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to higher levels of energy related investments

higher than average gross margins from service and replacement projects  as a result of the hurricanes along the gulf coast region  increased the gross profit percentage in fiscal excluding the direct impact of the power vac product line  business segment gross profit would have been approximately in fiscal gross profit was also negatively impacted by the operating performance of one of the company s smaller business units which had a number of jobs that were underestimated at quotation in previous years  as well as operational challenges in completing certain projects 
process control systems in fiscal  our process control systems business segment recorded revenues of million  down from million in fiscal this decrease in revenues is primarily attributable to the substantial completion of certain large projects in early business segment gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal gross profit in each of fiscal and was negatively impacted by approximately million related to legal and other costs incurred to recover amounts owed on a previously completed contract

consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of revenues in fiscal compared to of revenues in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to amortization expense  increased administrative costs related to the integration of the power vac product line and related operations and increased payroll and recruiting costs  which are consistent with the increase in volume 
additionally  bad debt expense increased primarily related to collection shortfalls associated with certain projects with operational issues at one of the company s smaller business units 
interest income and expense interest expense was million in fiscal  an increase of approximately million compared to fiscal the increase in interest expense is primarily due to interest expense imputed as a discount on the purchase price for the acquisition of the power vac product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal interest income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease resulted as cash generated from operations was used to reduce debt balances 
provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes of in fiscal compared to in fiscal our effective tax rate is impacted by income generated in the

adjustments to tax accruals are a component of the effective tax rate 
net income in fiscal  we recorded net income of million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share in fiscal we had an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses associated with higher levels of business activity and the integration and relocation costs of the power vac product line  partially offset by higher revenues and improved gross profits in our electrical power products business segment

direct material costs increased approximately  or million  during fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to higher unit prices for copper 
in addition  incremental production costs of approximately million were incurred during fiscal due to start up difficulties and inefficiencies related to the relocation of our distribution switch product line 

table of contents process control systems revenues in our process control systems business segment decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease in revenues is attributable to a decrease in the proportion of subcontracted installation activities and the substantial completion of various large projects in and early process control systems recorded revenues and profit of million from the settlement of a claim related to the central artery tunnel project in fiscal business segment gross profit decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal primarily related to the settlement of the claim related to the central artery tunnel project mentioned above

r and the vesting modification increased selling  general and administrative expenses by approximately million in fiscal salaries and incentive wages increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  amortization expense increased approximately million  of which million was attributable to our recent acquisitions 
the remaining increase of million is primarily attributable to increased professional fees  as well as an overall increase due to the increase in volume discussed above 
interest income and expense interest expense was approximately million in fiscal  an increase of approximately million compared to fiscal the increase in interest expense is primarily due to additional debt incurred to partially finance acquisitions and interest payments to state taxing authorities 
interest income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease was a result of decreased marketable securities 
provision for income taxes our provision benefit for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes of in fiscal compared to in fiscal our effective tax rate will generally be lower due to income generated in the united kingdom  which has a lower statutory rate than the united states  however  the lower statutory rate will be offset by certain expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes in the united kingdom  such as amortization of intangible assets 
the lower tax rate for fiscal resulted from a change in estimate on our extraterritorial income exclusion benefit on the prior year federal tax return and the reversal of state income tax accruals from previous years due to the expiration of the statutory limitations 
the overall effective tax rate improved as a result of the favorable tax impact of approximately million of pretax deductions in connection with the reconciliation of the income tax provision to the prior year income tax return 
in addition  adjustments to estimated tax accruals are analyzed and adjusted quarterly as events occur to warrant such change 
adjustments to tax accruals are a component of the effective tax rate

during fiscal and  cash used in operating activities was approximately million and million  respectively 
in all years  cash was principally used to fund growth in accounts receivable  inventories and costs related to projects which could not be billed under the contract terms 
we have used this cash  among other things  for working capital to support our increased levels of business activity 
investing activities investments in property  plant and equipment during fiscal totaled approximately million compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively

the primary source of cash from financing activities in fiscal was proceeds from the exercise of stock options  and for fiscal  borrowings of million under the uk term loan associated with our acquisition of s i and million under the uk revolving line of credit 
contractual obligations at september   our long term contractual obligations were limited to debt and leases 
the table below details our commitments by type of obligation  including interest if applicable  and the period that the payment will become due in thousands

we also had performance bonds totaling approximately million that were outstanding at september  performance bonds are used to guarantee contract performance to our customers 

table of contents outlook for fiscal our backlog of orders going into fiscal is approximately million  the highest in the history of the company 
customer inquiries  or requests for proposals  have steadily strengthened over the past three fiscal years 
we anticipate that strong business activities in our principal markets will continue into early backlog growth has been driven by strong market demand in petrochemical  utility and transportation markets 
additionally  our recent acquisitions have strengthened our strategic position in the electrical power products market and expanded our product offering in the utility  industrial and commercial markets 
we have enhanced our capabilities with the addition of medium and low voltage iec switchgear  intelligent motor control systems and power distribution solutions 
the power vac switchgear product line acquired from ge has a large installed base and a broad customer base across utility  industrial and commercial markets 
our recent acquisitions have provided us with a significantly broader product portfolio and enhanced our capabilities to meet market demands around the world 
we have also significantly enhanced our ability to reach a broader market and gain access to new customers with a long term commercial alliance with ge  which obligates ge to purchase from us subject to limited conditions for exceptions all of its requirements for ansi medium voltage switchgear and circuit breakers and other related equipment and components 
the costs and effort to relocate the power vac product line has negatively impacted our earnings to date  and we expect this to continue into early as we continue the integration efforts 
we believe that our expanded product portfolio and new channels to new markets have strengthened us in our electrical power products business and positioned us for continued growth 
we anticipate that we will continue to reinvest our cash generated from operations to support our increased business activity and the acquired power vac product line 
working capital needs are anticipated to increase with growing levels of business activity 
we believe that cash available and borrowing capabilities should be sufficient to finance anticipated operational activities  capital improvements and debt repayments for the foreseeable future 
working capital requirements or strategic acquisitions of new businesses or product lines could require additional borrowings 
effects of inflation we have experienced significant price pressures related to raw materials  primarily copper  aluminum and steel  since the us economy began to show signs of improvement in competitive market pressures limited our ability to pass these cost increases to our customers  thus affecting our earnings in and we anticipate that these inflationary pressures will continue to adversely impact our operations in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates to be critical in the preparation and reporting of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are primarily generated from engineering and manufacturing of custom products under long term contracts that may last from one month to several years  depending on the contract 
revenues from long term contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting as provided by the american institute for certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting  revenues are recognized as work is performed primarily based on the estimated completion to date calculated by multiplying the total contract price by percentage of performance to date  based on total costs or total labor dollars incurred to date to the total estimated costs or total labor dollars estimated at completion 
the method used to determine the percentage of completion is typically the 
table of contents cost method  unless the labor method is a more accurate method of measuring the progress of the project 
application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract 
contract costs include all direct material  direct labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and all costs associated with operation of equipment 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of the company s engineers  project managers and financial professionals 
factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in performance and the recoverability of any claims 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income  with their effects being recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
whenever revisions of estimated contract costs and contract values indicate that the contract costs will exceed estimated revenues  thus creating a loss  a provision for the total estimated loss is recorded in that period 
revenues associated with maintenance  repair and service contracts are recognized when the services are performed in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  revised and updated 
expenses related to these types of services are recognized as incurred 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain and continually assess the adequacy of an allowance for doubtful accounts representing our estimate for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay amounts due to us 
this estimated allowance is based on historical experience of uncollected accounts  the level of past due accounts  the overall level of outstanding accounts receivable  information about specific customers with respect to their inability to make payments and expectations of future conditions that could impact the collectibility of accounts receivable 
however  future changes in our customers operating performance and cash flows  or in general economic conditions  could have an impact on their ability to fully pay these amounts  which could have a material impact on our operating results 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived assets  including intangible assets with definite useful lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
the review for impairment of these long lived assets takes into account estimates of future cash flows 
for assets held for sale or disposal  the fair value of the asset is measured using quoted market prices or an estimation of net realizable value 
an impairment loss exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement requires that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized but instead requires a test for impairment to be performed annually  or immediately if conditions indicate that an impairment could exist 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
accruals for contingent liabilities from time to time  contingencies such as insurance and legal claims arise in the normal course of business 
pursuant to current accounting standards  we must evaluate such contingencies to subjectively determine the likelihood that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements  as well as evaluating whether the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if the likelihood is determined to be probable and it can be reasonably estimated  the estimated loss is recorded 
the amounts we record for insurance claims  warranties  legal and other contingent liabilities require judgments regarding the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred 
we use past experience and history  as well as the specific circumstances surrounding 
table of contents each contingent liability  in evaluating the amount of liability that should be recorded 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
developing our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we have not recorded any valuation allowances as of september   because we believe that future taxable income will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefits of those assets as the temporary differences in basis reverse over time 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
foreign currency translation the functional currency for our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency in which the entity is located 
the financial statements of all subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar have been translated into us dollars in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
all assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into us dollars using year end exchange rates  and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates during the respective period 
the us dollar results that arise from such translation  as well as exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances of a long term investment nature  are included in the cumulative currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
hedging activities sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted  requires that each derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability and measured at its fair value 
the statement also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings in either income loss from continuing operations or accumulated other comprehensive income loss  depending on whether the derivative qualifies for fair value or cash flow accounting treatment 
at september   we had no derivative instruments in place 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the company s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the provisions of fin are to be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption of this standard 
only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of fin fin is effective for our fiscal year beginning october  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements  but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information 
sfas no 
is effective for our fiscal year beginning october  the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 

table of contents in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits  an amendment of sfas no 
  and r 
sfas no 
requires an employer with a defined benefit pension plan to recognize the funded status of the benefit plan in its statement of financial position  recognize as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax  the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost pursuant to sfas no 
or sfas no 
 measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position and disclose in the notes to the financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses  prior service costs or credits and transition asset or obligation 
on september   we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
see note g of notes to consolidated financial statements for the impact of adopting these provisions 
the measurement provisions are effective for fiscal years ending after december  in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions we have entered into in the normal course of business 
these risks primarily relate to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risk we are subject to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates related to our floating rate bank credit facility 
at september   million was outstanding  bearing interest at approximately per year 
a hypothetical basis point increase in variable interest rates would result in a total annual increase in interest expense of approximately  while we do not currently have any derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk  we have in the past and may in the future enter into such contracts 
during each of the past three years  we have not experienced a significant effect on our business due to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency transaction risk we have significant operations that expose us to currency risk in the british pound sterling and to a lesser extent the euro 
we believe the exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because the foreign operations primarily invoice customers and collect obligations in their respective currencies or us dollars and a portion of our credit facility is payable in british pound sterling 
additionally  expenses associated with these transactions are generally contracted and paid for in the same local currencies 
while we do not currently have any derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk  we have in the past and may in the future enter into such contracts 
commodity price risk we are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain raw materials 
while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers  commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations 
we attempt to pass along such commodity price increases to our customers on a contract by contract basis to avoid a negative effect on profit margin 
while we may do so in the future  we have not entered into any derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to commodity risk in fiscal we continue to experience price increases with some of our key raw materials 
competitive market pressures may limit our ability to pass these cost increases to our customers  thus negatively impacting our earnings 
fluctuations in commodity prices may have a material impact on our future earnings and cash flows
