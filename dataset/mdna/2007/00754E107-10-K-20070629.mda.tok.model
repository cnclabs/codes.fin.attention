the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the risk factors as well as our financial statements and the related notes 
application of critical accounting policies application of our accounting policies requires management to make certain judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the financial statements 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates and judgments  although differing amounts could be reported if there are changes in the assumptions and estimates 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory allowances  impairment costs  depreciation and amortization  warranty costs  taxes and contingencies 
management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to an understanding of our financial statements and or as areas most dependent on management s judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 we recognize revenue from the sale of products when the products are shipped to the customer 
revenues from the sale of services consist of non recurring engineering charges  which are recognized when the services have been rendered 
historically  sales returns have amounted to less than of net sales and all sales are recorded net of sales returns and payment discounts 
impairment of long lived assets the company continually reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets using the methodology prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
the company also reviews long lived assets and the related intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
upon such an occurrence  recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows to which the assets relate  to the carrying amount 
if the asset is determined to be unable to recover its carrying value  then intangible assets  if any  are written down first  followed by the other long lived assets to fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows  appraised values or management s estimates  depending on the nature of the assets 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance the company has incurred losses over the past years  which creates a deferred tax benefit 
up to  we have recorded a valuation allowance that fully reserved the benefit because realization was doubtful 
in  with the addition of picometrix and having had two years of profitable operations  we reduced the allowance to approximately half of the deferred asset 
with the acquisition of picometrix  we recorded a deferred tax liability to reflect the non deductible nature of the future amortization of the intangible assets acquired 
that deferred tax liability will be amortized over the same life as the intangible assets 
inventories the company s inventories are stated at standard cost which approximates the first in  first out method or market 
slow moving and obsolete inventories are reviewed throughout the year 
to calculate a reserve for obsolescence  we begin with a review of our slow moving inventory 
any inventory  which has been slow moving within the past months  is evaluated and reserved if deemed appropriate 
in addition  any residual inventory  which is customer specific and remaining on hand at the time of contract completion  is reserved for at the standard unit cost 
the complete list of slow moving and obsolete inventory is then reviewed by the production  engineering and or purchasing departments to identify items that can be utilized in the near future 
these items are then excluded from the analysis and the remaining amount of slow moving and obsolete inventory is then reserved for 
additionally  non cancelable open purchase orders for parts we are obligated to purchase where demand has been reduced may be reserved 
reserves for open purchase orders where the market price is lower than the purchase order price are also established 
if a product that had previously been reserved for is subsequently sold  the amount of reserve specific to that item is then reversed
