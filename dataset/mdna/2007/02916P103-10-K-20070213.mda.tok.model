item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements and as a result of the factors we describe under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
see special note regarding forward looking statements appearing at the beginning of this report and risk factors set forth in item a of this report 
overview we are a leading north american manufacturer of covered hopper and tank railcars 
we also repair and refurbish railcars  provide fleet management services and design and manufacture certain railcar and industrial components used in the production of our railcars as well as railcars and non railcar industrial products produced by others 
we provide our railcar customers with integrated solutions through a comprehensive set of high quality products and related services 
we operate in two segments manufacturing operations and railcar services 
manufacturing operations consists of railcar manufacturing and railcar and industrial component manufacturing 
railcar services consists of railcar repair and refurbishment services and fleet management services 
we have experienced significant growth in the last three years with revenues growing from million in and million in to million in our revenues in included million from manufacturing operations and million from the sale of railcar services 
our revenues in included million from manufacturing operations and million from the sale of railcar services 
our revenues in included million from manufacturing operations and million from the sale of railcar services 
our revenues and operations in were impacted by the shut down of our marmaduke  arkansas tank railcar manufacturing operations as a result of the tornado that struck the complex during april this caused the complex to be shut down for more than four months  during which we did not ship any tank railcars 
we believe we recovered substantially all the lost profits associated with the tornado through our business interruption insurance coverage 
manufacturing operations we manufacture all of our railcars in modern complexes located in paragould and marmaduke  arkansas  which were built in and  respectively 
we strategically located these complexes in close proximity to our main shipper and railroad customers  as well as our main suppliers of railcar components 
as of december   none of our over  employees at our paragould and marmaduke complexes are represented by a union 
however  employees of two of our repair facilities and one of our component manufacturing facilities  representing approximately of our total workforce as of december   are represented by unions 
we manufacture components in four other manufacturing facilities 

table of contents our paragould complex was designed primarily to produce covered hopper railcars but is also capable of producing other railcar types 
for example  in and the first nine months of  we produced centerbeam platform railcars at our paragould complex 
this complex originally consisted of two production tracks with an initial production capacity of approximately six railcars per day 
changes in plant design and manufacturing processes since  along with the addition of and increase in painting and lining capabilities in and  and a third production track in  increased our production capacity 
the production lines at our paragould complex are designed to provide flexibility for efficient and rapid changeover in product mix between various types and sizes of railcars 
in  we further expanded our railcar sub assembly and small components manufacturing capabilities through the acquisition of custom steel  inc custom steel operates a facility located adjacent to our facility in kennett  missouri that we have added into our railcar sub assembly group 
this facility produces value added fabricated steel components that primarily support our railcar manufacturing operations 
our marmaduke complex was built in to manufacture tank railcars 
the complex is designed to produce both pressure and non pressure tank railcars 
in january  we expanded by adding production capacity to our tank railcar manufacturing complex in marmaduke  arkansas 
also  during the fourth quarter of  we began site preparation and broke ground on a flexible railcar manufacturing plant to be built adjacent to our marmaduke  arkansas tank railcar manufacturing plant 
we expect construction to begin on the plant during the first quarter of and we anticipate that this new plant will be capable of producing tank  covered hopper and intermodal railcars 
our operations for at our marmaduke complex were negatively impacted by the shut down caused by the tornado that damaged or destroyed equipment and damaged some of the property 
this caused the complex to be shut down for approximately four months and decreased shipments of tank railcars for we provide components for our railcar manufacturing operations as well as for other railcar manufacturers and other industries 
components manufactured by us include aluminum and steel fabricated and machined parts and carbon steel  aluminum  high alloy and stainless steel castings  primarily for the trucking and construction equipment and oil and gas exploration markets 
our revenues from the sales of components exclude the components we manufacture for use in our railcar manufacturing business 
railcar services our railcar services include railcar repair and refurbishment and fleet management and engineering services 
our railcar repair and refurbishment services are provided through our network of six full service maintenance and repair facilities and four mobile repair units 
our railcar service facilities are located in strategic areas near major customers 
we have established long term business relationships with a customer base that includes railcar leasing companies  shippers and railroads 
in  our railcar services revenues increased by to million  from million in in  our railcar services revenues increased by to million  from million in we believe the growth in these revenues reflects the overall trend in the united states toward increased railcar utilization  the increase in our customer base  the increase in our service offerings and the increase in the number of railcars under fleet management by us 
our fleet management business complements both our railcar repair and refurbishment and railcar manufacturing operations 
as of december   we managed approximately  railcars for various customers  including approximately  railcars for arl 
arl formation and exchange we formed arl  a company that buys and leases railcars  as our wholly owned subsidiary in june as part of the formation of arl and its further capitalization  acf and certain of its subsidiaries transferred to us and arl their railcars and related leases  as well as equity in certain of acf s subsidiaries that supported its leasing business  in exchange for shares of our new preferred stock and preferred interests of arl 
we  in turn  contributed the assets we received to arl in return for common equity interests in arl 
acf is a company beneficially owned and controlled by mr 
icahn 
on june   we transferred all of our interest in arl to the holders of our new preferred stock  all of which are beneficially owned and controlled by mr 
icahn  in exchange for the redemption of  shares of our new preferred stock held by them plus accumulated dividends 
the description of our operations and the presentation of our financial information and consolidated financial statements has been prepared on a standalone basis  excluding arl s operations for all periods  and all transactions 
table of contents giving effect to arl s formation and subsequent transfer have been eliminated from the financial statements  with the exception of deferred tax assets retained by us 
any differences related to the amounts originally capitalized and the amount paid for arl or our subsequent transfer of arl have been recorded through adjustments to shareholder s equity  including certain tax benefits that we received as a result of using arl s previously incurred tax losses 
see note of our consolidated financial statements 
factors affecting operating results the following is a discussion of some of the key factors that have in the past and are likely in the future to affect our operating results 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the cyclical nature of the north american railcar market  our reliance on a few customers for most of our revenues  our historical reliance on revenues from our affiliates for a significant portion of our revenue  our reliance on large orders  the variable purchasing patterns of our customers and fluctuation in supplies and prices of raw materials and components used in railcar manufacturing 
see risk factors for a more comprehensive list of factors that could affect our operating results 
cyclicality of the railcar industry 
historically  the north american railcar market has been highly cyclical and we expect it to continue to be highly cyclical 
we believe that downturns in the railcar manufacturing industry will occur in the future and will result in decreased demand for our products and services 
the cycles in our industry result from many factors that are beyond our control  including economic conditions in the united states 
although railcar production has increased since  industry professionals believe demand for railcars may have reached a peak and may not persist if favorable economic and other conditions are not sustained 
even if a sustained economic recovery occurs in the united states  demand for our railcars may not match or exceed expected levels 
an economic downturn may result in increased cancellations of railcar orders  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to convert our railcar backlog into revenues 
if industry backlog for railcars declines below certain levels  one of our customers  which accounts for a significant portion of our december  backlog  will be permitted to cancel some of its orders after days written notice  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  an economic downturn in the united states could result in lower sales volumes  lower prices for railcars and a loss of profits for us 
furthermore  a substantial number of the end users of our railcars acquire railcars through leasing arrangements with our leasing company customers 
economic conditions that result in higher interest rates would increase the cost of new leasing arrangements  which could cause our leasing company customers to purchase fewer railcars 
customer concentration 
railcars are typically sold pursuant to large  periodic orders  and a limited number of customers typically represent a significant percentage of our railcar sales in any given year 
in  sales to each of our top three customers were approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
the loss of any significant portion of our sales to any major customer  the loss of a single major customer or a material adverse change in the financial condition of any one of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
most of our individual railcar customers do not make railcar purchases every year because they do not need to replace or replenish their railcar fleets on a yearly basis 
many of our customers place orders for railcars on an as needed basis  sometimes only once every few years 
as a result  the order levels for railcars  the mix of railcar types ordered and the railcars ordered by any particular customer have varied significantly from quarterly period to quarterly period in the past and may continue to vary significantly in the future 
as railcar sales comprised  and  respectively  of our total revenue in  and  our results of operations in any particular quarter may be significantly affected by the number of railcars and the product mix of railcars we deliver in any given period 
additionally  because we record the sale of a railcar at the time we complete production  the railcar is accepted by the customer following inspection  the risk for any damage or loss with respect to the railcar passes to the customer and title to the railcar transfers to the customer  and not when the order is taken  the timing of completion  delivery and acceptance of significant customer orders will have a considerable effect on fluctuations in our quarterly results 
revenues from affiliates 
in  and  our revenues from affiliates accounted for  and of our total revenues  respectively 
these affiliates consisted of entities beneficially owned and controlled by carl c 
icahn  the chairman of our board of directors and our principal controlling stockholder 
the decline in our percentage of revenues from affiliates is primarily attributable to the growth in our revenues from third parties 
we anticipate that our percentage of revenues from affiliates will continue to decline if we are successful in growing our business 
nevertheless  we believe that revenues from affiliates will continue to constitute an important portion of our business 
a significant reduction in sales to affiliates could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

table of contents raw material costs 
the price for steel  the primary raw material used in the manufacture of our railcars  increased sharply in as a result of strong worldwide demand  limited availability of production inputs for steel  including scrap metal  industry consolidation and import trade barriers 
these factors have caused a corresponding increase in the cost and decrease in the availability of castings and other railcar components constructed with steel 
costs for other railcar manufacturers have been similarly affected by the availability and pricing of steel and castings and other components 
the costs for raw steel  based on a semi finished steel mill product index  have almost doubled during the period from october through december the availability of scrap metal has been limited by exports of scrap metal to china and  as a result  steel producers have charged steel and scrap metal surcharges in excess of agreed upon prices 
in  steel pricing declined through the third quarter but increased  however  in the fourth quarter and appear to have stabilized going into the first quarter of domestic demand for steel continues to be strong 
raw material supply  while still volatile  stabilized in in  we were unable to pass on an estimated million in increased raw material and component costs to our customers under existing customer contracts 
in  we were unable to pass through to our customers an estimated million of such increased costs 
in response to the increasing cost of raw materials and railcar components  we began working with suppliers to reduce surcharges that they charge us and started entering into variable pricing contracts with our railcar customers that allow us to pass along changes in costs of certain raw materials and components to our customers to protect us against future changes in these costs 
by september   we completed all of the deliveries of railcars under contracts that did not allow us to pass through these increased costs 
all of our current deliveries and backlog for railcars include variable pricing to protect us against further volatility in the price of certain raw materials and railcar components 
component supply constraints 
our business depends on the adequate supply of numerous specialty components  such as railcar wheels  brakes  sideframes  axles  bearings  yokes  bolsters and other heavy castings  and specialized raw materials  such as normalized steel plates used in the production of railcars 
over the last few years many suppliers have been acquired or have ceased operations  which has caused the number of alternative suppliers of specialty components and raw materials to decline 
the combination of industry consolidation and high demand has caused recent railcar industry wide shortages of many critical components as many reliable suppliers are frequently at or near production capacity 
in certain cases  such as for railcar wheels  only two significant suppliers continue to produce the type of component we use in our railcars 
with the recent increased demand for railcars  our remaining suppliers are facing significant challenges in providing components and materials on a timely basis to us and other railcar manufacturers 
if our suppliers of railcar components and raw materials were to stop or reduce the production of railcar components and raw materials that we use  go out of business  refuse to continue their business relationships with us  reduce the amounts they are willing to sell to us or become subject to work stoppages  our business would be disrupted 
our inability to obtain components and raw materials in required quantities or of acceptable quality could result in significant delays or reductions in railcar shipments 
this would materially and adversely affect our operating results 
furthermore  our ability to increase our railcar production to expand our business depends on our ability to obtain an adequate supply of these railcar components and raw materials 
our participation in the ohio castings joint venture has facilitated our ability to meet some of our requirements for heavy castings such as bolsters and sideframes 
in  ohio castings expanded its castings production and added couplers and yokes to its products 
we believe that this expanded production capability should help to reduce our risk of encountering supply shortages 
in  and  we purchased million  million and million  respectively  of railcar components produced by ohio castings 
completion of our centerbeam platform railcar contract 
in  we entered into an agreement with the greenbrier companies to manufacture centerbeam platform railcars at our paragould manufacturing complex 
this was the first time we manufactured centerbeam platform railcars and  as a result of start up and increased steel costs  we did not realize a profit on this contract 
we completed our deliveries of these centerbeam platform railcars in july and we do not anticipate significant sales to greenbrier in the future 
our revenues from our sales of centerbeam platform railcars were million in and million in upon completion of production of the centerbeam platform railcars for greenbrier  we converted the manufacturing line at our paragould complex that we used to manufacture those railcars to manufacture covered hopper railcars 
this manufacturing line  along with our two other covered hopper railcar manufacturing lines at our paragould manufacturing complex  have been operating at capacity since the conversion and  as a result of our significant backlog for covered hopper cars  we intend to fully utilize those lines  subject to cancellations or adjustments in existing railcar orders in our backlog  through at least we have generally been able to achieve higher profit margins on our sale of covered hopper railcars than we were able to achieve on our sales of the centerbeam platform railcars to greenbrier 

table of contents acquisition of custom steel  inc on march   we acquired the stock of custom steel  inc  a subsidiary of steel technologies inc 
custom steel operates a facility located adjacent to our facility in kennett  missouri that we have successfully added into our railcar sub assembly group 
the custom steel facility produces value added fabricated parts that primarily support our railcar manufacturing operations 
this acquisition provided costs savings during outlook we believe that demand for covered hopper and tank railcars that we produce will continue to be strong in and should continue at or near current levels due to generally positive economic conditions  the current united states economic recovery  strong industry wide backlog for covered hopper and tank railcars  increased rail traffic  the projected replacement of aging railcar fleets and an increasing demand for products that are hauled and stored in covered hopper and tank railcars 
we believe that we are strategically positioned to capitalize on the current strong demand for railcars  and that we have growth opportunities across our broad array of product and service offerings 
we are adding new tank railcar capacity to meet the anticipated strong demand 
charges and costs associated with our january initial public offering we have incurred significant additional selling  administrative and other fees and expenses in connection with becoming a public company 
in addition  we have incurred a number of charges in connection with transactions consummated in connection with our initial public offering 
acf employee benefit plans in anticipation of our initial public offering  we entered into a retirement benefit separation agreement  effective december   with acf for allocating the assets and liabilities of the pension benefit plans retained by acf in the acf asset transfer in which some of our employees were participants  and which has relieved us of our further employee benefit reimbursement obligations to acf under the acf asset transfer agreement 
acf is a company beneficially owned and controlled by mr 
icahn 
the principal employee benefit plans affected by this arrangement are two acf sponsored pension plans  known as the acf employee retirement plan and the acf shippers car line pension plan  and certain acf sponsored retiree medical and retiree life insurance plans 
under the arrangement  in exchange for our agreement to pay acf approximately million and to become the sponsoring employer under the acf shippers car line pension plan  including the assumption of all obligations for our and acf s employees under that plan  we have ceased to be a participating employer under the acf employee retirement plan and have been relieved of all further reimbursement obligations  including obligations for our employees  under that plan 
as of december   the acf shippers car line pension plan had million of unfunded liabilities on an accounting basis that were assumed by us in connection with this arrangement 
the payment of approximately million which was made by us to acf represents our and acf s estimate of the payment required to be made by us to achieve an appropriate allocation of the assets and liabilities of the benefit plans accrued after the acf asset transfer  with respect to each of our and acf s employees in connection with the two plans 
this allocation was determined in accordance with actuarial calculations consistent with those that would be required to be used by acf and us in allocating plan assets and liabilities at such time as we cease to be a member of acf s controlled group 
as part of this arrangement  we also assumed sponsorship of a retiree medical and retiree life insurance plan for active and identified former employees that were covered by the acf sponsored medical and retiree life insurance plans  and acf was relieved of all further liability under those plans with respect to those employees 
as of december   the post retirement liability related to this obligation was approximately million 
acf paid us million to assume the pre portion of this liability 
the total amount of the obligations we assumed was million 
we previously accrued an estimated liability related to this settlement of million 
in december  we recorded an increase in the estimated liability of million and a loss on the settlement of the same amount  of which we recorded million in cost of railcar services with the remaining amount being shown on the statement of operations as pension settlement expense 
see note of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents equity incentive awards we also incurred a non cash operating expense in connection with the issuance at the close of our initial public offering to james unger  our chief executive officer  of  shares of our common stock 
the expense we recognized in connection with this grant equals the value of the shares granted to mr 
unger as of the date of issuance  which was million 
we recognized million of this expense in the first quarter of when of these shares vested 
we recognized the remaining million of this expense in equal monthly amounts over the twelve months from february through january the balance of these shares vested in january see note of our consolidated financial statements 
we also issued options to purchase  shares of common stock under our equity incentive plan upon the pricing of our initial public offering 
these options have been granted at an exercise price equal to per share 
the options have a term of five years and vest in equal annual installments over a three year period 
we estimate that our stock option expense for all these options will total approximately million expense recognized was million over the three year vesting period assuming a black scholes calculation based on the following assumptions stock volatility of  year term  interest rate of  and dividend yield of 
see note of our consolidated financial statements 
the equity incentive plan will be administered by the board of directors or a committee of the board  which is authorized to grant incentive stock options  nonqualified stock options  stock appreciation rights sars  performance shares  restricted stock  other forms of equity based or equity related awards  or other cash awards 
other additional expenses we agreed to pay william benac  our chief financial officer  a one time special cash bonus of  this bonus was contingent on us issuing common stock to the public in an offering registered with the sec prior to april  or mr 
icahn selling his controlling interest in us to a third party in a private transaction 
this bonus will be paid on april  if at any time on or before april   we terminate mr 
benac s employment without cause  he resigns for good reason  or a change in control occurs  he will be entitled to receive the special cash bonus of  upon the occurrence of such event 
mr 
benac s right to the special cash bonus of  and any severance immediately terminates if his employment is terminated for cause or he resigns without good reason 
as a result of this arrangement  we have accrued a  expense in the first quarter of other additional expenses we incurred in connection with our public offering included the write off of the remaining million of deferred financing costs that we incurred in connection with our industrial revenue bond financings  which we repaid in full with a portion of the net proceeds of our offering 
we had previously been amortizing these expenses over the remaining terms of the industrial revenue bonds 
other equity awards issued after the initial public offering subsequent to going public  we issued options to purchase  shares of common stock under our equity incentive plan during the second quarter of these options have been granted at an exercise price equal to per share 
the options have a term of five years and vest in equal annual installments over a four year period 
we estimate that our stock option expense for all these options will total approximately million expense recognized was million over the four year vesting period using the same assumptions and methodology to determine the value of these options as was used for the options issued in connection with our initial public offering

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes our historical operations as a percentage of revenues for the periods shown 
our historical results are not necessarily indicative of operating results that may be expected in the future 
year ended december  revenues manufacturing operations railcar services total revenues cost of goods sold cost of manufacturing cost of railcar services total cost of goods sold gross profit pension settlement expense income related to insurance recoveries  net gain on asset conversion  net selling  administrative and other expenses stock based compensation expense earnings from operations interest income interest expense income loss from joint venture earnings before income tax expense income tax expense net earnings comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  our net earnings for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million 
several factors caused this increase in earnings during the current year 
in  we shipped  railcars  more than the  railcars we shipped in most of our revenues  and all of our revenues for the sale of railcars  for the year ended december  included sales under contracts that allowed us to adjust our sale prices to pass on to our customers the impact of increases in costs of certain raw materials  particularly steel  and components 
furthermore  our gross margins in were impacted by losses we incurred from our sale of centerbeam platform railcars manufactured at our paragould complex 
our earnings from operations increased as a percent of revenue to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december  primarily due to the million of income received and recorded for business interruption and property damage insurance recoveries in these recoveries were not included in our revenues and therefore  they increased earnings as a percent of revenues 
during  we also issued equity awards to key employees resulting in million of stock based compensation expense incurred in compared to none in our results of operations for were impacted by the marmaduke tank railcar manufacturing complex shut down caused by the tornado that damaged or destroyed equipment and damaged some of the property 
this caused the complex to be shut down for approximately four months and decreased expected shipments of tank railcars for we believe we recovered substantially all the lost profits associated with the tornado through our business interruption insurance coverage 

table of contents revenues our revenues in increased to million from million in this increase was attributable to an increase in revenues from both manufacturing operations and railcar services 
our manufacturing operations revenues increased to million in from million in this increase was mainly attributable to our delivery of an additional railcars in and increased prices resulting from our ability to pass through our increased raw material and component costs and an increase in the base unit price of some of our railcars 
our revenues from sales of railcars increased million to million in from million in the additional deliveries of railcars in reflected increased sales of covered hopper railcars 
we believe that the increases were primarily attributable to the continuing recovery of the railcar industry  which is represented by a strong backlog of orders as of december  our increased number of covered hopper railcar shipments in  compared to  also reflects the conversion of our paragould facility back to covered hopper railcar production 
until july  we produced centerbeam railcars at our paragould facility  and we shipped a total of centerbeam railcars in this increase was partially offset by a decrease of tank railcar production due to the tornado damage and related shutdown of marmaduke 
in  our manufacturing operations revenues included million  or of our total consolidated revenues  from transactions with affiliates  compared to million  or of our total consolidated revenues  in these revenues were attributable to sales of railcars to companies controlled by mr 
icahn 
our railcar services revenues increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to strong railcar repair demand 
in  our railcar services revenues included million  or of our total consolidated revenues  from transactions with affiliates  as compared to million  or  in gross profit our gross profit increased to million  in from million in notwithstanding the negative impact of the tornado during 
our gross profit margin increased to in from in the increase in our gross profit margin was primarily attributable to an increase in our gross profit margin for our manufacturing operations 
our gross profit margin for our manufacturing operations increased to in from in this increase was primarily attributable to our ability to pass through increased raw material and component costs through variable pricing contracts  the shift in railcar mix  and improved efficiencies 
during  we were able to pass through most of our raw material and component costs increases 
during  we were unable to pass through million of million of increased raw material and component costs 
all of our current railcar manufacturing contracts have variable cost provisions that adjust the delivery price for changes in certain raw material and component costs 
additionally  our gross profit margins for our manufacturing operations were negatively impacted by a contract to manufacture centerbeam platform railcars 
no profit was realized on this contract primarily due to increased steel costs at the time that we were not able to pass through to our customers 
we produced and shipped of these centerbeam platform railcars in the centerbeam platform railcar contracts were completed at our paragould complex in july and we have since converted the manufacturing line at that complex to manufacturing covered hopper railcars 
furthermore  during the first six months of  we incurred additional costs in connection with the completion of our new third production line at our paragould complex  including costs associated with outsourcing our railcar painting and lining for the increased railcar production from that new production line and costs of the initial training and supplies for that production line 
we completed additional painting and lining capabilities at our paragould complex in november this new painting and lining capacity allowed us to improve margins in as we reduced outsourcing of this function 
our gross profit margin for railcar services increased to in from in this increase was primarily attributable to our service facilities operating at a higher volume level  which resulted in efficiencies in labor and overhead 
furthermore  the type of work that was being performed allowed for less handling costs on certain jobs 
pension settlement expense as a result of the retirement benefit separation agreement we entered into with acf in december  we recorded an aggregate expense of million  of which million was allocated to pension settlement expense and million was allocated to cost of railcar services 
as a result of this agreement  we assumed sponsorship of a former acf pension plan  a

income related to insurance recoveries  net and gain on asset conversion  net we have property insurance covering wind and rain damage to our property  incremental costs and operating expenses we incurred due to the tornado damage at our marmaduke complex 
in addition  we have insurance for business interruption as a direct result of the insured damage 
our deductibles on these policies are million for property insurance and a five day equivalent time element business interruption deductible  which resulted in million 
the business interruption insurance deductible was ratably recognized over the course of the five month period during which the business interruption occurred 
we settled both the property damage insurance claim and the business interruption insurance claim with our insurance carrier and recorded final gains in the income statement 
the final property damage claim settlement amounted to million  prior to application of the deductible  and the final business interruption insurance settlement amounted to million  prior to application of the deductible 
we identified assets with net book value of million that were damaged or destroyed by the tornado 
the charge for these asset write offs was netted against the net insurance settlement of million related to the property damage insurance claim to arrive at the gain on asset conversion  net 
other costs amounting to million were incurred related to clean up costs and various miscellaneous repairs associated with the storm damage 
the tornado related insurance settlement for the property damage claim includes million in cash proceeds received during to provide funds to clean up and repair the plant in marmaduke as well as order replacement assets so the plant was operational in a timely manner 
these cash advances are classified as cash provided for investing activities and as cash provided by operating activities as they were received as part of the property insurance claim that was filed for all the property  plant and equipment as well as inventory that were damaged by the tornado 
as we agreed on a final settlement amount with our insurance carrier  we wrote off the assets and recorded the actual net gain attributable to the storm from the replacement of the property with new property and equipment 
we recognized the gain on the replacement of property damaged or destroyed of million as gain on asset conversion in the statement of operations computed as follows year ended december  in thousands property damage insurance claim property damage claim deductible property damage insurance settlement  net assets damaged  clean up costs  repair costs gain on asset conversion  net our business interruption insurance policy and the final settlement provided coverage for continuing expenses  employee wages and the loss of profits resulting from the temporary marmaduke plant shut down caused by the storm

other factors for the increase in selling  administrative and other expenses in was attributable to expenses incurred in connection with our initial public offering  increased expenses associated with being a public company and increase expenses to support our growing business 
furthermore  we believe our selling  administrative and other expenses will continue to increase as we continue to internalize previously outsourced infrastructure and add administrative and other employees to support such infrastructure 
interest expense and interest income interest expense for was million compared to million for  representing a decrease of million 
in  we repaid substantially all of our outstanding debt with a portion of the net proceeds of our initial public offering 
our interest expense in included the write off of approximately million of deferred financing costs that we incurred in connection with the repayment of our industrial revenue bond and credit facility financings 
our interest income decreased to million in from million in income loss from joint venture loss from joint venture for was million compared to income from joint venture of million for  representing a decrease of million 
in  ohio castings incurred a significant charge related to a reserve of million million being ari s share of that charge related to potentially defective castings that were produced by one of the ohio castings facilities over an identified time period 
it was the decision of ohio castings management to replace all castings produced during this period that were potentially defective even though testing only showed approximately of the castings produced were defective 
income tax expense income tax expense for was million  or of our earnings before income taxes  as compared to million for  or of our earnings before income taxes 
our effective tax rate was lower than the rate due to expenses included in pre tax earnings  for which we did not receive a deduction for tax purposes in these expenses result from liabilities and obligations retained by our affiliate  acf  as part of its transfer of assets to us in although acf is responsible for any costs associated with these liabilities  we are required to recognize these costs as expenses in order to reflect the full cost of doing business 
the entire amount of such permanently nondeductible expenses is treated as contribution of capital resulting in an increase to our effective tax rate 
these expenses associated with employee benefit plans ended on december   when our retirement plans were separated from the acf plans 
the expenses included in pre tax income were million in furthermore  the rate is reduced by the domestic production activities deduction  which allows companies to deduct of their income for domestic activities

this improvement was partially offset by increased costs associated with outsourcing our railcar painting and lining for our new production line at our paragould complex and the start up costs for that new production line 
revenues our revenues in increased to million from million in this increase was attributable to an increase in revenues from both manufacturing operations and railcar services 
our manufacturing operations revenues increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to our delivery of an additional  railcars in and increased prices resulting from our ability to pass through a portion of our increased raw material and component costs and increases in the base unit price for some of our railcars 
our revenues from sales of railcars increased million to million in from million in the additional deliveries of railcars in reflected increased sales of covered hopper and tank railcars and a continuation of deliveries of centerbeam platform railcars ordered in these increased sales reflected our increased capacity at our paragould complex supported by the continued strong backlog of orders for our railcars 
our manufacturing operations revenues attributable to sales of railcar and industrial components increased million in to million from million in this increase was primarily attributable to increased unit sales reflecting increased railcar manufacturing and industrial activity 
for  our manufacturing operations revenues included million or of our total revenues  from transactions with affiliates  compared to million or of our total revenues  in these revenues were primarily attributable to sales of railcars to companies controlled by mr 
icahn 
our railcar services revenues increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to strong railcar demand and a million increase in leasing and other fleet management service revenue from subsidiaries of our affiliate  arl  a company controlled by mr 
icahn 
the increase in railcar services revenues from arl was fully offset by million of pass through costs paid to acf  also a company controlled by mr 
icahn  that was included in our cost of railcar services 
our management agreements with the arl subsidiaries were terminated on june  however  we continue to provide repair  maintenance and fleet management services for those fleets 
in  our railcar services revenues included million  or of our total revenues  from transactions with affiliates  as compared to million  or  in gross profit our gross profit increased to million in from million in our gross profit margin increased to in from in  primarily reflecting improved margins in our manufacturing operations 
our gross profit margin for our manufacturing operations increased to in from in this increase was primarily attributable to the contribution from increased overhead absorption on plant work volume and our ability to pass through a greater portion of increased raw material and component costs through variable pricing contracts 
in  we were unable to pass through million of increased raw materials and component costs 
in  we were unable to pass through approximately million of increased raw material and component costs 
all of our railcar manufacturing contracts now have variable cost provisions that adjust the delivery price for changes in certain raw material and component costs 
however  increases in raw material and component costs would have an adverse effect on our gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues  because we do not earn any additional net profit margin on our price adjustments 
our improvement in gross profit margin in was partially offset by a contract to manufacture centerbeam platform railcars  a new product line for us in this was the first time we manufactured centerbeam platform railcars and  as a result of start up and increased steel costs  we did not realize a profit on this contract 
our centerbeam platform railcar contracts were completed at our paragould complex in july and we have since converted the manufacturing line at that complex to manufacturing covered hopper railcars 
in december  we also incurred a million charge allocated to our cost of services associated with our pension settlement 

table of contents in the first six months of  we also incurred additional costs in connection with the completion of our new third production line at our paragould complex  including costs associated with outsourcing our railcar painting and lining for the increased railcar production from that new production line and costs of the initial training and supplies for that production line 
we completed additional painting and lining capabilities at our paragould complex in november this new painting and lining capacity allowed us to improve margins as we reduced outsourcing of this function 
our gross profit margin for railcar services increased to in from in this increase was primarily attributable to our service facilities operating at a higher volume level  which resulted in efficiencies in labor and overhead 
pension settlement expense as a result of the retirement benefit separation agreement we entered into with acf in december  we recorded an aggregate expense of million  of which million was allocated to pension settlement expense and million was allocated to cost of railcar services 
as a result of this agreement  we assumed sponsorship of a former acf pension plan  a retiree medical and retiree life insurance plan and we have ceased to be a participating employer under the acf employee retirement plan and have been relieved of all further reimbursement obligations  including for our employees  under that plan 
see charges and costs associated with our public offering acf employee benefit plans 
selling  administrative and other expenses our selling  administrative and other expenses increased in to million from the million expense in selling  administrative and other expenses were of sales in as compared to of sales in our increase in the amount of our selling  administrative and other expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in information technology costs  audit and outside professional service fees 
interest expense and interest income interest expense was million and million for years ended december  and  respectively 
our interest income decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to a million loan to an affiliate that was repaid in that was partially offset by interest income we earned on a million secured loan to mr 
icahn in october of in january of  we transferred our entire interest in this loan to arl in exchange for additional common interests in arl and in satisfaction of our million loan from arl 
income tax expense income tax expense for was million  or of our earnings before income taxes  as compared to million for  or of our earnings before income taxes 
our effective tax rate is impacted by expenses included in pre tax earnings for which we do not receive a deduction for tax purposes 
these expenses result from the liabilities and obligations retained by acf as part of its transfer of assets to us in although acf is responsible for any costs associated with these liabilities  we are required to recognize these costs as expenses in order to reflect the full cost of doing business 
the entire amount of such permanently nondeductible expenses is treated as contribution of capital resulting in an increase to our effective tax rate 
these expenses in pre tax income were million and million for and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity have historically been the cash generated from our operations  the sale of securities and funds generated from borrowings 
during  most of our proceeds were generated from our initial public offering and cash generated from operations 
prior to our initial public offering  our capital needs had primarily been satisfied by entities affiliated with mr 
icahn and working capital loans from third party lenders 
we completed our initial public offering on january  and issued approximately million shares at an offering price of per share 
our net proceeds from this offering of approximately million were used  among other things  to 
table of contents repay most of our long term debt  to redeem all of our outstanding redeemable preferred stock and to repay all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
the remaining net proceeds were used for the purchase or a strategic supplier and other property  plant and equipment 
outstanding debt revolving credit facility 
in january  concurrent with the completion of the initial public offering  we repaid all amounts outstanding under our then revolving credit facility and entered into a million amended and restated revolving credit facility with north fork business capital corporation  as administrative agent for various lenders 
the amended and restated revolving credit facility replaced our former million revolving credit facility with north fork business capital corporation 
during october  we entered into a first amendment to the revolving credit agreement  which increased the facility to million 
during february  we entered into a second amendment to the revolving credit agreement 
terms of the revolving credit facility  as amended  are maximum borrowing 
our revolving credit facility  as amended  provides for a maximum borrowing of the lesser of a million or b an amount equal to a percentage of eligible accounts receivables plus a percentage of the eligible raw materials  work in process and finished goods inventory  which at december  was million 
eligible receivables include only accounts receivable to our customers in the united states or canada arising from sales in the ordinary course of business with non affiliates 
in addition  the revolving credit facility  as amended  includes a million capital expenditure sub facility that is based on a percentage of the costs related to capital projects we may undertake  term 
the revolving credit facility  as amended  expires in october interest rate and fees 
borrowings bear an interest rate of a base rate less  where the base rate is the higher of the highest prime  base or equivalent rate of interest published by the administrative agent  or the published annualized rate for day dealer commercial paper published in the wall street journal 
in addition  we are granted a month  month or month libor rate plus 
we paid closing fees of million and are required to pay an unused line fee of per year on the unused portion of our revolving credit facility  as amended  collateral 
our receivables  inventory and a pledged deposit account  together with assets we purchase with the proceeds from the capital expenditure sub facility  serve as collateral under the revolving credit facility  as amended  and the capital expenditure sub facility 
in addition  we are required to maintain one or more blocked accounts to which all our collections would be remitted 
under the revolving credit facility  as amended  the types of collections that are subject to the blocked account consist of all collections including all cash  funds  checks  notes  instruments  any other form of remittance tendered by account debtors in respect of payment of our receivables and any other payments received by us with respect to any collateral 
if the funds  which we can draw under the revolving credit facility  as amended  fall under million  the proceeds in the blocked accounts are transferred to the administrative agent and the administrative agent is required to apply all such proceeds to our loan account with the administrative agent  conditional upon final collection  effecting a payment of any obligations that are outstanding at such time 
the interest that the administrative agent holds in such proceeds until such time as they are applied to the obligations is in the nature of a collateral security interest 
upon termination of the administrative agent s security interests in such proceeds in accordance with applicable laws generally governing the termination of security interests and bank deposits  the administrative agent returns to us any proceeds it holds after satisfaction of existing or contingent obligations owed to the administrative agent and the other lenders 
we may borrow  repay  and reborrow revolving credit loans in accordance with the terms of the revolving credit facility  as amended  financial covenants 
our revolving credit facility  as amended  requires that when excess availability under the revolving credit facility is less than million or has been less than million at any time during the prior days  we must meet an adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to on a quarterly and or annual basis  and further requires that if any indebtedness has been incurred or assumed during the applicable quarter  or when excess availability under the revolving credit facility is less than million or has been less than million at any time during the prior days  we must meet a leverage ratio calculated based on the outstanding amount of indebtedness to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as defined in the revolving credit facility  as amended  of not greater than to on a quarterly and or annual basis  and 
table of contents negative covenants 
our revolving credit facility  as amended  includes certain limitations on  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  modify our current governing documents  sell or dispose of collateral  grant credit and declare or pay dividends or make distributions on common stock or other equity securities 
the limitation on certain of the actions addressed by the revolving credit facility  as amended  is in the nature of a right in favor of the administrative agent and our lenders to accelerate all of our obligations under the revolving credit facility  as amended  a demand right  that is triggered by certain actions  rather than in the nature of a negative covenant by which we contractually agree not to take such actions 
included among the actions that trigger a demand right are certain actions to modify governing documents  sell or dispose of collateral  grant credit  incur indebtedness  and make dividends and distributions 
an incurrence of indebtedness triggers a demand right if it causes the adjusted ratio of our indebtedness to ebitda  as defined in the revolving credit facility  as amended  to be greater than to the direct or indirect payment of dividends or distributions  or purchase  redemption  or retirement of capital stock  equity interests  options or rights to purchase capital stock or equity interests  or payments to sinking or analogous funds  triggers a demand right if  when excess availability under the revolving credit facility is less than million or has been less than million at any time during the prior days  it causes the adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio to be less than to or the ratio of adjusted indebtedness to ebitda to be greater than to  each on a quarterly and or annual basis  as defined in the revolving credit facility  as amended 
cash flows the following table summarizes our net cash provided by or used in operating activities  investing activities and financing activities and our capital expenditures for the periods presented year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities 
cash flows from operating activities are affected by several factors  including fluctuations in business volume  contract terms for billings and collections  the timing of collections on our accounts receivables  processing of payroll and associated taxes and payments to our suppliers 
we do not typically experience business credit losses  although a payment may be delayed pending completion of closing documentation  and a typical order of railcars may not yield cash proceeds until after the end of a reporting period 
our net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  net earnings were impacted by the non cash items including but not limited to depreciation and amortization expense of million  a loss of million on the write off of property  plant and equipment  a gain related to insurance compensation of million for assets and storm clean up  stock based compensation expense of million and other smaller adjustments 
cash provided by operating activities attributable to changes in our current assets and liabilities included a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
this was offset primarily by an increase in accounts receivable from affiliate of million  an increase in inventories of million  an increase in prepaid expenses of million  a decrease in accounts payable due to affiliate of million and a decrease in accrued expenses and taxes of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable and increase in accounts receivable from affiliate are due to timing of payments received from various commercial customers and affiliated customers 
the increase in inventories was primarily attributable to an increase in the cost of raw materials  including steel and increase production levels at our paragould covered hopper manufacturing complex during additionally  inventory increased due to the impact of marmaduke raw material purchases that were in process when the plant was shut down by the storm 
even though operations were shut down at marmaduke  we still were required under certain supply contracts to purchase raw material inventory from certain vendors 

table of contents the increase in prepaid expenses was primarily attributable to payments during for wheel sets to be shipped in the future 
these payments are made under a supply agreement entered into with an unaffiliated third party vendor 
other increases were due to the timing of premium payments for significant insurance policies for and the payments were made in the first quarter of while the payments were made in the fourth quarter of this caused an increase in the prepaid balance at december  from the balance at december  the decrease in accounts payable due to affiliate was due to timing of payments made to various affiliate vendors during the decrease in accrued expenses and taxes was due to estimated tax payments being made throughout investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
purchases of property  plant and equipment amounted to million during the year ended december  this was for the purchase of equipment and construction of buildings at multiple locations to increase capacity and operating efficiencies 
additionally  property  plant and equipment purchases included assets purchased to replace damaged and destroyed assets at our marmaduke tank railcar manufacturing complex as a result of the tornado 
these purchases are described in further detail below under capital expenditures 
cash used in investing activities during also included million of cash used to acquire custom steel in these cash outflows were offset by a receipt of million related to the property insurance claim for the property damage incurred at marmaduke from the tornado 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  in  we received million in proceeds from the initial public offering  offset by offering costs of million  the redemption of preferred stock of million  the payment of preferred dividends of million  the reduction of amounts due to affiliates of million and the repayment of debt of million 
our preferred stock was held by entities controlled by carl c 
icahn  our principal beneficial stockholder and the chairman of our board of directors 
capital expenditures 
we continuously evaluate facility requirements based on our strategic plans  production requirements and market demand and may elect to make capital investments at higher or lower levels in the future 
these investments are all based on an analysis of the potential for these additions to improve profitability and future rates of return 
in response to the current demand for our railcars  we are pursuing opportunities to increase our production capacity and reduce our costs through continued vertical integration of our production capacity 
from time to time  we may expand our business by acquiring other businesses or pursuing other strategic growth opportunities 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million 
of these expenses  approximately million were for expansion purposes 
approximately million was for cost reduction purposes 
approximately million of capital expenditures were for necessary replacement of assets 
in addition  effective march   we completed the acquisition of the stock of custom steel  inc from steel technologies  inc 
the total amount invested in the acquisition was million 
on april   our marmaduke  arkansas tank railcar manufacturing complex was damaged by a tornado 
various costs have been incurred for capital expenditures in repairing the damage to the complex 
as of december   we have spent million to bring the complex and the related equipment back to working order 
the insurance carrier and we agreed to a final settlement amount of million after application of the deductible for clean up and asset replacement 
we have a number of capital projects that were completed in early or are currently underway including the recently completed tank railcar expansion at our marmaduke  arkansas plant to increase capacity  as well as our new flexible railcar manufacturing plant to be built adjacent to our tank railcar manufacturing plant in marmaduke 
the marmaduke expansion of additional production capacity was completed in january construction on the new flexible railcar manufacturing plant  which we anticipate would be capable of producing tank  covered hopper and intermodal railcars  began with site preparation in october railcar production at the new flexible plant is currently expected to begin in early we expect to continue to invest in projects  including possible strategic acquisitions  to reduce manufacturing costs  improve production efficiencies  maintain our equipment and to otherwise complement and expand our business 
for  our 
table of contents current capital expenditure plans include approximately million of projects that we expect will maintain equipment  improve efficiencies or reduce costs 
these capital expenditure plans include the following the construction of a new flexible railcar manufacturing plant at our marmaduke complex for approximately million  expenditures to broaden our component manufacturing capabilities and to further integrate our supply chain for approximately million  ongoing maintenance capital expenses of approximately million  the construction of a tank head press plant at our marmaduke complex for approximately million  and the construction of a wheel and axle assembly facility at our paragould complex for approximately million 
the amounts set forth above are estimates only 
we cannot assure that we will be able to complete any of our projects on a timely basis or within budget  if at all 
in addition to the foregoing  we are considering the possible investment in the construction of a new plant to manufacture one or more additional components that are a critical to the manufacture of our railcars  and that are only available from limited sources of supply 
we are currently investigating alternatives to structuring and financing this venture  including the possibility of participating with one or more partners 
we cannot assure that we will proceed with this venture or if we proceed  the terms and conditions of our participation  including the amount and manner of our investment 
we anticipate that the new railcar plant and any other future expansion of our business will be financed through cash flow from operations  our amended revolving credit facility  term debt associated directly with that expenditure or other new financing 
we believe that these sources of funds will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our expected operating requirements over the next twelve months 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain term debt or other new financing on favorable terms  if at all 
our long term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance and our ability to continue to meet financial covenants under our revolving credit facility  as amended  and any other indebtedness 
we may also require additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions or incur from time to time other investments and these capital requirements could be substantial 
on february   we announced our intention to issue  of senior notes due  in a private offering expected to close in february the notes will not be registered under the securities act of  as amended the securities act  or any state securities laws  and are being offered only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on rule a promulgated under the securities act 
unless so registered  the notes may not be offered or sold in the united states except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the securities act and applicable state securities laws 
we cannot assure that we will complete this offering on favorable terms  if at all 
our operating performance may also be affected by matters discussed under risk factors  and trends and uncertainties discussed in this discussion and analysis  including those factors discussed under factors affecting operating results  as well as elsewhere in this annual report 
these risks  trends and uncertainties may also adversely affect our long term liquidity 
dividends 
the board of directors declared regular cash dividends of per share of our common stock for each quarter of on february   the board of directors declared a cash dividend of per share of our common stock to shareholders of record at the close of business on march  these dividends are payable on april  we intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future 
our revolving credit facility  as amended  contains provisions that trigger a demand right if  when excess availability under the revolving credit facility is less than million or has been less than million at any time during the prior days  we pay dividends on our common stock unless the payment does not cause the adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio fixed charges  pursuant to the revolving credit facility  as amended  include any dividends paid or payable on our common stock to be less than to or the adjusted ratio of our indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  after giving effect to any debt incurred to pay any such dividend to be greater than to  each on a quarterly and or annual basis 
in addition  under delaware law  our board of directors may declare dividends only to the extent of our surplus which is defined as total assets at fair market value minus total liabilities  minus statutory capital  or if there is no surplus  out of our net profits for the then current and or immediately preceding fiscal years 
moreover  our declaration and payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our operating results  strategic plans  capital requirements  financial condition  covenants under our borrowing arrangement and other factors our board of directors considers relevant 
accordingly  we may not pay dividends in any given amount in the future  or at all 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect that these obligations and commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years after years in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations fees related to revolving credit agreement capital expenditures pension funding total our revolving credit facility  as amended  permits us to borrow million thereunder and expires in less than three years 
the operating lease commitment includes the future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases for property and equipment leased by us 
we entered into two vendor supply contracts with minimum volume commitments in october with suppliers of materials used at our railcar production complexes 
the agreements have terms of two and three years respectively 
we have agreed to purchase a combined total of million from these two suppliers from to in and  we expect to purchase million and million  respectively under these agreements 
we entered into two supply agreements  in january and june  with a steel supplier for the purchase of regular and normalized steel plate 
the agreements each have terms of five years and may be terminated by either party at any time after two years  upon twelve months prior notice 
each agreement requires us to purchase a minimum volume requirement for the steel covered by that agreement at prices that fluctuate with the market 
we have no commitment under these arrangements to buy a minimum amount of steel  other than the minimum percentages  if our overall steel purchases decline 
we have entered into a supply agreement with one of our ohio castings joint venture partners  to purchase up to of the production  consisting of sideframes and bolsters  produced at the foundry being operated by a subsidiary of ohio castings 
our purchase commitment under this supply agreement is dependent upon the number of car sets manufactured by this foundry  which is jointly controlled by us and the other two members of ohio castings 
in january  we entered into an agreement with a third party vendor for a specified number of wheels and related parts  including axles and roller bearings 
we were required to prepay for a portion of the requirements 
total purchases under this contract amounted to million in in  we entered into an agreement with two parties  including one of the members of the ohio castings joint venture and an affiliate of one of the members of the ohio castings joint venture to purchase a minimum of of our wheel  bearing  coupler  yoke and knuckle requirements for the years  and contingencies in connection with our acquisition in january of castings llc  which owns a one third ownership interest in ohio castings company  llc  from acf industries holding corp  a company beneficially owned and controlled by mr 
icahn  we agreed to assume certain  and indemnify all liabilities related to and arising from acf industries holding corp 
s investment in castings llc  including the guarantee of castings llc s obligations to ohio castings  the guarantee of bonds in the amount of million issued by the state of ohio to one of ohio castings subsidiaries  of which million was outstanding as of december   and the guarantee of a million state loan that provides for purchases of capital equipment  of which million was outstanding as of december  the two other partners of ohio castings have made similar guarantees of these obligations 

table of contents we are subject to comprehensive federal  state  local and international environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment  the management  use  processing  handling  storage  transport or disposal of hazardous materials and wastes  or otherwise relating to the protection of human health and the environment 
these laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for the environmental condition of our current or formerly owned or operated facilities  and our own negligent acts  but also may expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for our actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken 
in addition  these laws may require significant expenditures to achieve compliance  and are frequently modified or revised to impose new obligations 
civil and criminal fines and penalties and other sanctions may be imposed for non compliance with these environmental laws and regulations 
our operations that involve hazardous materials also raise potential risks of liability under common law 
we are involved in investigation and remediation activities at properties that it now owns or leases to address historical contamination and potential contamination by third parties 
we are involved with state agencies in the cleanup of two sites under these laws 
these investigations are in process but it is too early to be able to make a reasonable estimate  with any certainty  of the timing and extent of remedial actions that may be required  and the costs that would be involved in such remediation 
substantially all of the issues identified relate to the use of the properties prior to their transfer to us in by acf and for which acf has retained liability for environmental contamination that may have existed at the time of transfer to us 
acf has also agreed to indemnify us for any cost that might be incurred with those existing issues 
however  if acf fails to honor our obligations to us  we would be responsible for the cost of such remediation 
we believe that our operations and facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
we have been named the defendant in a lawsuit in which the plaintiff  oci chemical company  claims we were responsible for the damage caused by allegedly defective railcars that were manufactured by us 
the lawsuit was filed on september  in the united states district court  eastern district of missouri 
the plaintiff seeks unspecified damages in excess of  the plaintiffs allege that the failures in certain components caused the contents transported by these railcars to spill out of the railcars causing property damage  clean up costs  monitoring costs  testing costs and other costs and damages 
we believe that we are not responsible for the damage and have meritorious defenses against liability 
we are from time to time party to various other legal proceedings arising out of our business 
such proceedings  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 
we believe that there are no proceedings pending against us  which  if determined adversely  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates and assumptions are periodically evaluated and may be adjusted in future periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
some of these policies involve a high degree of judgment in their application 
the critical accounting policies  in management s judgment  are those described below 
if different assumptions or conditions prevail  or if our estimates and assumptions prove to be incorrect  actual results could be materially different from those reported 
revenue recognition revenues from railcar sales are recognized following completion of manufacturing  inspection  customer acceptance and shipment  which is when title and risk for any damage or loss with respect to the railcars passes to the customer 
in some cases  painting and lining work may be outsourced to an independent contractor and  as a result  the sale for the railcar may be recorded after customer acceptance when it leaves the manufacturing plant and the sale for the lining work may be separately recorded following completion of that work by the independent contractor  customer acceptance and final shipments 
revenues from railcar and industrial components are recorded at the time of product shipment  in accordance with our contractual terms 
revenue for railcar maintenance services is recognized upon completion and shipment of railcars from our plants 
revenue for fleet management services is recognized as performed 
we record amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling as part of sales in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs  and we record related costs in our cost of sales 

table of contents accounts receivable we carry our accounts receivable at cost  less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
on a routine basis  we evaluate our accounts receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts  based on a history of past write offs and collections and current credit conditions 
accounts are placed for collection on a limited basis once all other methods of collection have been exhausted 
once it has been determined that the customer is no longer in business and or refuses to pay  the accounts are written off 
our bad debt experience has been minimal 
write offs could be materially different than reserves if economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends 
product warranties we record a liability for an estimate of costs that we expect to incur under our basic limited warranty when manufacturing revenue is recognized 
warranty terms are based on the negotiated railcar sales contracts and typically are for periods of up to five years 
factors affecting our warranty liability include the number of units sold and historical and anticipated rates of claims and costs per claim 
we assess quarterly the adequacy of our warranty liability based on changes in these factors 
our warranty claims were million in  million in and million in actual results differing from estimates could have a material effect on results from operations in the event that unforeseen warranty issues were to occur 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  and include the cost of materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead 
we evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
if inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs as cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
additionally  purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
the criteria for determining impairment or such long lived assets to be held and used is determined by comparing the carrying value of these long lived assets to be held and used to management s best estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the estimated fair value of the assets is measured by estimating the present value of the future discounted cash flows to be generated 
we incurred an impairment loss in the year ended december  and reduced the carrying value of equipment purchased under a lease agreement from an unrelated third party by million in the first quarter of  for its manufacturing plants which is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations under costs of manufacturing operations 
no impairment losses were recorded in the years ended december  or any future determination requiring write off of a significant portion of long lived assets recorded on our balance sheet could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents income taxes for financial reporting purposes  income tax expense is estimated based on planned tax return filings 
the amounts anticipated to be reported in those filings may change between the time the financial statements are prepared and the time the tax returns are filed 
further  because tax filings are subject to review by taxing authorities  there is also the risk that a position on a tax return may be challenged by a taxing authority 
if the taxing authority is successful in asserting a position different than that taken by us  differences in a tax expense or between current and deferred tax items may arise in future periods 
any such differences  which could have a material impact on our financial statements  would be reflected in the financial statements when management considers them probable of occurring and the amount reasonably estimable 
valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
management s estimates of the realization of deferred tax assets is based on the information available at the time the financial statements are prepared and may include estimates of future income and other assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
no valuation allowance is currently recorded  as we expect to realize our deferred tax assets 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  which is a revision of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  and supersedes apb no 
 accounting for stock issues to employees  or apb sfas r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors based on the estimated fair values of the awards on their grant dates 
our share based awards include stock options and restricted stock awards 
we use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of our option awards issued under the equity incentive plan 
the black scholes model requires estimates of the expected term of the option  future volatility  dividend yield  and the risk free interest rate 
as of december   unrecognized compensation costs related to the unvested portion of restricted stock were approximately million and were recognized during january as of december   unrecognized compensation costs related to the unvested portion of stock options were approximately million and are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately months 
accounting for expenses paid by affiliate in october  we acquired railcar components manufacturing  railcar maintenance and certain other assets from acf 
in connection with that transaction  acf retained  and agreed to indemnify and hold us harmless for  certain liabilities and obligations relating to the conduct of business and ownership of the assets prior to the transfer  including liabilities relating to employee benefit plans subject to certain exceptions of the transferred employees  workers compensation  environmental contamination and third party litigation 
in december we entered into a retirement benefit plan separation agreement  releasing us and acf from our respective employee benefit reimbursement obligations under the acf asset transfer agreement 
at december   the total liability retained by acf under the acf asset transfer agreement was million  which is related to environmental and retirement liabilities 
although acf is responsible for any costs associated with the retained liabilities  we have continued to reflect the costs associated with those retained liabilities in our financial statements as an expense in order to reflect the full cost of doing business  and the payment by acf of these expenses is reflected as additional paid in capital  as required by staff accounting bulletin topic t 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  amounts due to from affiliates and accounts payable approximate fair values because of the short term maturity of these instruments 
the fair value of long term debt is calculated by discounting cash flows through maturity using our current rate of borrowing for similar liabilities 
the fair value of the note receivable from acf  which was carried at face amount plus accrued interest  could not reasonably be estimated due to the lack of market for similar instruments 
fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time  based on relevant market information about the financial instrument 
these estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and  therefore  cannot be determined with precision

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on the borrowings under our revolving credit facility  as amended 
however  we do not plan to enter into swaps or other hedging arrangements to manage this risk because we do not believe the risk is significant 
on an annual basis  a change in the interest rate in our revolving credit facility will increase or decrease our interest expense by  for every million of outstanding borrowings 
we are exposed to price risks associated with the purchase of raw materials  especially steel and heavy castings 
the cost of steel  heavy castings and all other materials used in the production of our railcars represent approximately of our direct manufacturing costs 
given the significant increases in the price of raw materials since november  this exposure can affect our costs of production 
we believe that the risk to our margins and profitability has been greatly reduced by the variable pricing contracts we now have in place 
we have negotiated all of our current railcar manufacturing contracts with our customers to adjust the purchase prices of our railcars to reflect increases or decreases in the cost of certain raw materials and components and  as a result  we are able to pass on to our customers substantially all of the increased raw material and component costs with respect to the railcars produced and delivered during we believe that we currently have excellent 
table of contents supplier relationships and do not anticipate that material constraints will limit our production capacity 
such constraints may exist if railcar production was to increase beyond current levels  or other economic changes occur that affect the availability of our raw materials 
we are not exposed to any significant foreign currency exchange risks
