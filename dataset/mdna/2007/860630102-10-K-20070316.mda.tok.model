page critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note a to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report on form k for the year ended december   describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the following critical accounting policies and estimates are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
legal reserves the company records reserves related to legal proceedings resulting from lawsuits and arbitrations  which arise from its business activities 
some of these lawsuits and arbitrations claim substantial amounts  including punitive damage claims 
management has determined that it is likely that ultimate resolution in favor of the claimant will result in losses to the company on certain of these claims 
the company has  after consultation with outside legal counsel and consideration of facts currently known by management  recorded estimated losses to the extent they believe certain claims are probable of loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
factors considered by management in estimating the company s liability are the loss and damages sought by the claimant plaintiff  the merits of the claim  the amount of loss in the client s account  the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of the employee of the company  the total cost of defending the litigation  the likelihood of a successful defense against the claim  and the potential for fines and penalties from regulatory agencies 
results of litigation and arbitration are inherently uncertain  and management s assessment of risk associated therewith is subject to change as the proceedings evolve 
after discussion with counsel  management  based on its understanding of the facts  accrues what they consider appropriate to reserve against probable loss for certain claims  which is included in the consolidated statement of financial condition under the caption accounts payable and accrued expenses 
reserve for doubtful receivables from former employees the company offers transition pay  principally in the form of upfront loans  to investment executives and certain key revenue producers as part of the company s overall growth strategy 
these loans are generally forgiven over a five to ten year period if the individual satisfies certain conditions  usually based on continued employment and certain performance standards 
if the individual leaves before the term of the loan expires or fails to meet certain performance standards  the individual is required to repay the balance 
in determining the allowance for doubtful receivables from former employees  management considers the facts and circumstances surrounding each receivable  including the amount of the unforgiven balance  the reasons for the terminated employment relationship  and the former employees overall financial positions

investment securities of registered broker dealer subsidiaries are carried at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value 
the fair value of investments  for which a quoted market or dealer price is not available  is based on management s estimates 
among the factors considered by management in determining the fair value of investments are the cost of the investment  terms and liquidity  developments since the acquisition of the investment  the sales price of recently issued securities  the financial condition and operating results of the issuer  earnings trends and consistency of ope rating cash flows  the long term business potential of the issuer  the quoted market price of securities with similar quality and yield that are publicly traded  and other factors generally pertinent to the valuation of investments 
the fair value of these investments is subject to a high degree of volatility and may be susceptible to significant fluctuation in the near term 
page income tax matters the provision for income taxes and related tax reserves is based on management s consideration of known liabilities and tax contingencies for multiple taxing authorities 
known liabilities are amounts that will appear on current tax returns  amounts that have been agreed to in revenue agent revisions as the result of examinations by the taxing authorities and amounts that will follow from such examinations but affect years other than those being examined 
tax contingencies are liabilities that might arise from a successful challenge by the taxing authorities taking a contrary position or interpretation regarding the application of tax law to the company s tax return filings 
factors considered by management in estimating the company s liability are results of tax audits  historical experience  and consultation with tax attorneys and other experts 
dilution as of december   there were  shares of our common stock issuable on outstanding options  with an average weighted exercise price of  and  outstanding stock unit grants  with each unit representing the right to receive shares of our common stock at a designated time in the future 
the restricted stock units vest on an annual basis over the next five years  and are distributable  if vested  at future specified dates 
of the outstanding restricted stock unit awards   shares are currently vested and  are unvested 
assuming vesting requirements are met  the company anticipates that  shares under these awards will be distributed in   will be distributed in   will be distributed in  and the balance of  will be distributed thereafter 
as described below  an employee will realize income as a result of an award of stock units at the time shares are distributed in an amount equal to the fair market v alue of such shares at that time  and the company is entitled to a corresponding tax deduction in the year of such issuance 
unless an employee elects to satisfy such withholding in another manner  such as by paying the amount in cash or by delivering shares of stifel financial corp 
common stock already owned by such person and held by such person for at least six months  the company may satisfy tax withholding obligations on income associated with such grants by reducing the number of shares otherwise deliverable in connection with such awards  such reduction to be calculated based on a current market price of the company s common stock 
based on current tax law  the company anticipates that the shares issued when the awards are paid to the employees will be reduced by approximately to satisfy such withholding obligations  so that approximately of the total restricted stock units that are distributable in any particular year will be converted into issued and outstanding shares 
goodwill and intangible assets the company records all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill  at fair value as required by sfas no 
 business combinations 
determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired requires certain management estimates 
at december  the company had goodwill of million 
the company is required under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  to perform impairment tests of our goodwill and intangible assets at least annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be fully recoverable 
if the impairment tests indicate that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value then an impairment loss would be required to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in an amount equal to the excess carrying value 
the company utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis in performing its impairment analysis 
assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates are often subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors  including external and internal factors 
factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  economic trends and market conditions  changes in revenue growth trends or business strategies  unanticipated competition  discount rates  technology  or government regulations 
in assessing the fair value of our reporting units  the volatile nature of the securities markets and industry requires us to consider the business and market cycle and assess the stage of the cycle in estimating the timing and extent of future cash flows 
in addition to discounted cash flows  we consider other information such as public market comparables and multiples of recent mergers and acquisitions of similar businesses 
the company has elected to perform its annual impair ment test as of july the results of the impairment tests performed at that date did not indicate any impairment 
we believe the assumptions used in performing our impairment tests are reasonable and appropriate  however  different assumptions and estimates could potentially affect the results of our impairment analysis
