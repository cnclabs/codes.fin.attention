electronic parts catalog 
our enhanced epc system  which is fully integrated with apal  is a software system that enables our store team members to identify millions of application uses for automotive parts and accessories 
the epc system enables store team members to assist our customers in their parts selection and ordering based on year  make  model and engine type of their vehicles 
our centrally based epc data management system enables us to reduce the time needed to exchange data with our vendors and ultimately catalog and deliver updated  accurate product information

available parts and accessories are then ordered electronically from another store  law  pdq or master pdq with immediate confirmation of price  availability and estimated delivery time 
our epc system also contains enhanced search engines and user friendly navigation tools that enhance our team members ability to look up any needed parts as well as additional products the customer needs to complete their automotive repair project

store support center merchandising virtually all of our merchandise is selected and purchased for our stores by team members at our centralized store support center in roanoke  virginia 
in  we purchased merchandise from over vendors  with no single vendor accounting for more than of purchases 
our purchasing strategy involves negotiating multi year agreements with certain vendors  which allows us to achieve more favorable terms and pricing 
our merchandising team is currently led by a group of seven senior professionals  who have an average of years of automotive purchasing experience and years in retail 
the merchandising team is skilled in sourcing high quality products globally and maintaining consistent inventory levels 
the merchandising team has developed strong vendor relationships in the industry and  in a collaborative effort with our vendor partners  utilizes a highly effective category management process 
we believe this process  which develops a customer focused business plan for each merchandise category  improves comparable store sales  gross margin and inventory turns 
our merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality brand name automotive parts and accessories such as bosch  castrol  stp  prestone  monroe  bendix  purolator  dayco and trico  which generates diy customer traffic and also appeals to commercial customers 
in addition to these branded products  we stock a wide selection of high quality proprietary products that appeal to value conscious customers 
these lines of merchandise include everything from chemical and wash and wax products to tools  batteries  parts and interior automotive accessories under the names of professional s favorite tm  joe s garage tm  mechanic s choice tm  auto xpress tm  autocraft tm  endurance tm and wearever tm 
sales of replacement parts account for a majority of our net sales and typically generate higher gross margins than maintenance items or general accessories 
we customize our replacement part mix based on a merchandising program designed to optimize inventory mix at each individual store 
the custom assortment is based on that store s historical and projected sales mix coupled with regionally specific customer needs 
supply chain our supply chain consists of centralized inventory management and transportation functions which support a logistics network of distribution centers  pdq warehouses and stores 
our inventory management team utilizes a replenishment system  or e  to monitor the distribution center  pdq warehouse and store inventory levels and order additional product when appropriate while streamlining costs associated with the handling of that product 
e utilizes the most up to date information from our point of sale system as well as inventory movement forecasting based upon history  sales trends by sku  seasonality and demographic shifts in demand 
e combines these factors with service level goals  vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions to determine the timing and size of purchase orders 
a significant portion of our purchase orders are sent via electronic data interchange  with the remainder being sent by computer generated e mail or facsimile 
our transportation team utilizes a transportation management system for efficiently managing incoming shipments to the distribution centers and stores 
benefits from this system include reduced vendor to distribution center freight costs  visibility of purchase orders and shipments for the entire supply chain  a reduction in distribution center inventory  or safety stock  due to consistent transit times  decreased third party freight and billing service costs  decreased distribution center to store freight costs and higher store in stock position 
we currently operate eight distribution centers 
all of these distribution centers are equipped with our distribution management system  or dcms 
our dcms provides real time inventory tracking through the processes of receiving  picking  shipping and replenishing at our distribution centers 
the dcms  integrated with 
table of contents technologically advanced material handling equipment  significantly reduces warehouse and distribution costs  while improving efficiency 
this equipment includes carousels  pick to light systems  robotic picking  radio frequency technology  voice technology and automated sorting systems 
through the continued implementation of our supply chain initiatives we expect to further increase the efficient utilization of our distribution capacity 
we believe our current capacity will allow us to support in excess of  stores 
subsequent to december   the company announced its plan to build a new distribution center in indiana scheduled to open in mid we currently offer over  skus to substantially support all of our retail stores via our stand alone pdq warehouses and or our eight distribution centers all of which stock pdq items 
stores have visibility to inventory in their respective facilities and can place orders to these facilities  or as an alternative  through an online ordering system to virtually any of the other facilities 
ordered parts are delivered to substantially all stores on a same day or next day basis through our dedicated pdq trucking fleet and third party carriers 
store inventories are replenished from our eight distribution centers 
in addition  we operate a pdq warehouse that stocks over  incremental skus of harder to find automotive parts and accessories 
this facility is known as the master pdq warehouse and utilizes existing pdq distribution infrastructure and or third party arrangements to provide next day service to substantially all of our stores 
advertising we have an extensive advertising program designed to communicate our merchandise offerings  product assortment  competitive prices  free services and commitment to customer service 
the program is focused on establishing advance auto parts as the solution for a customer s automotive needs 
we utilize a mix of media that reinforces our brand image  including television  radio  print  promotional signage and outdoor media  plus our proprietary in store television network and internet site 
our advertising plan is a brand building program built around television and radio advertising 
the plan is supported by print and in store signage 
our television advertising is a combination of national and regional media in both sports and entertainment programming 
radio advertising  which is used as a supplementary medium  generally airs during peak drive times 
we also sponsor sporting events  racing teams and other events at all levels in a grass roots effort to positively impact individual communities  including hispanic and other ethnic communities  to create awareness and drive traffic for our stores 
since early  we supported our new advertising campaign  we re ready in advance throughout all of our media 
we believe this advertising campaign differentiates advance auto parts in the customer s mind by positioning us as both a source for brand name auto parts and accessories at low prices and as a resource for expert advice and useful tips to help customers keep their vehicles running smoothly 
the campaign includes creative and compelling television and radio commercials designed to drive sales and build an enduring  positive image of advance auto parts as a special place to shop 
since  we have built upon the campaign through an integrated consumer education program 
this program is intended to build our image as not only the source for product  but also the best resource for vehicle maintenance information 
our free brochure kiosk displaying we re ready with answers and our free monthly video clinic broadcasts on advance tv  our exclusive in store how to network  are just two elements of this growing program 
we believe we will differentiate our stores from our competitors by providing our customers valuable information regarding why to and how to perform regular maintenance on their vehicles  in order to enhance their vehicles performance  reliability  safety and appearance 
our goal with this initiative is to continue our long term brand building success  increase customer loyalty and expand our customer base 
ai segment we acquired ai in september the acquisition  which included stores throughout new england and new york  a distribution center and ai s wholesale distribution business  complements our growing presence in the difm market in the northeast 
ai s business primarily serves the commercial market from its store locations 
in addition  its north american sales division services warehouse distributors and jobbers throughout north america 
we believe ai provides a 
table of contents high level of service to its commercial customers by providing quality parts  unsurpassed customer service and efficient parts delivery 
as a result of its extensive sourcing network  ai is able to serve its customers in search of replacement parts for both domestic and imported cars and light trucks with a greater focus on imported parts 
the vast majority of ai s product is sold under it proprietary brand 
the ai stores offer an average of  skus with access to an additional  unique skus through its logistics network 
at december   we operated stores under the autopart international trade name in the following states throughout the northeast location number of stores location number of stores location number of stores connecticut new hampshire rhode island maine new york vermont massachusetts the following table sets forth information concerning increases in the total number of our ai stores beginning stores new stores stores closed ending stores of the new stores in  stores were acquired in september as a result of our ai acquisition 
seasonality our business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the highest sales occurring in the spring and summer months 
in addition  our business can be affected by weather conditions 
while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods  extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate 
team members at february   we employed  full time team members and  part time team members 
our workforce consisted of of our team members employed in store level operations  employed in distribution and employed in our corporate offices 
we have never experienced any labor disruption and are not party to any collective bargaining agreements 
we believe that our team member relations are good 
we allocate substantial resources to the recruiting  training and retention of team members 
our performance management process allows us to align each team member s goals with our corporate strategic goals 
we believe this program provides us with a well trained  productive workforce that is committed to high levels of customer service and assures a qualified team to support future growth 
trade names  service marks and trademarks we own a number of trade names and own and have federally registered several service marks and trademarks  including advance auto parts  western auto  parts america  autopart international and pdq for use in connection with the automotive parts retailing business 
in addition  we own and have registered a number of trademarks for our proprietary products 
we believe that these trade names  service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy 
we do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect the use of these trade names and marks  and we actively defend and enforce them 

table of contents competition our primary competitors are both national and regional retail chains of automotive parts stores  including autozone  inc  o reilly automotive  inc  csk auto corporation and the pep boys manny  moe jack  discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products  wholesalers or jobber stores  including those associated with national parts distributors or associations  such as napa and carquest  independent operators and automobile dealers that supply parts 
we believe that chains of automotive parts stores that  like us  have multiple locations in one or more markets  have competitive advantages in customer service  marketing  inventory selection  purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers 
the principal competitive factors that affect our business include store location  availability  customer service and product offerings  quality and price 
environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business  including those governing recycling of batteries and used lubricants  and regarding ownership and operation of real property 
we handle hazardous materials as part of our operations  and our customers may also use hazardous materials on our properties or bring hazardous materials or used oil onto our properties 
we currently provide collection and recycling programs for used automotive batteries and used lubricants at all of our stores as a service to our customers 
pursuant to agreements with third party vendors  used batteries and lubricants are collected by our team members  deposited into vendor supplied containers or pallets and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal 
persons who arrange for the disposal  treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal  treatment or other site affected by such substances 
we own and lease real property 
under various environmental laws and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under or in such property 
these laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the release of such hazardous or toxic substances 
other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place  and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances 
from time to time  we receive notices from the environmental protection agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own  lease or operate or may have owned  leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible 
compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our operations to date 
growth strategy our growth strategies consist of the following increase our average sales per store 
in  our average sales per aap store reached an industry leading level of million per store 
we plan to continue increasing our average sales per store by  among other things improving store execution with a focus on customer service  execution of our category management program  continued maturation of our sales initiatives for our diy customers including local purchase ordering  factory direct ordering  salvage body parts and our custom mix store specific merchandise assortment  the implementation of our store remodeling program  with now more than of our chain remodeled and targeting a total of aap stores to be remodeled annually  consistent growth and execution of our commercial program  including optimization of delivery vehicles  enhanced merchandising and marketing programs and focus on making our supply chain more responsive 
expand our operating margin 
in addition to driving operating margin expansion through increased average sales per store and continued comparable store sales growth  we will continue to focus on increasing margins by improving our purchasing efficiencies with vendors  utilizing our supply chain infrastructure and existing distribution network to optimize our inventory mix and maximize distribution capacity  controlling our operating 
table of contents expenses  including an examination of both corporate and store level and continuing to implement our category management and custom mix initiatives and increase direct importing  including the expansion of our private label and proprietary brands in our aap stores 
increase free cash flow 
we have generated free cash flow over the last five years 
our strategy is to invest back into our business to drive further progress towards our four financial goals 
we look to deploy additional cash in the most optimal way to increase shareholder value  which has included stock repurchases and selective acquisitions and more recently cash dividends 
increase return on invested capital 
we believe we can increase our return on invested capital by increasing our average sales per store and our margins 
we believe we can also increase our return on invested capital by leveraging our supply chain initiatives to increase sales faster than inventory growth  implementing a lower cost store remodel program and selectively expanding our store base primarily in existing markets 
based on our experience  such in market openings provide higher returns on our invested capital by enabling us to leverage our distribution infrastructure  marketing expenditures and local management resources 
we intend to open to aap and ai stores primarily in existing markets in industry the united states automotive aftermarket industry is generally grouped into two major categories diy and difm 
according to the automotive aftermarket industry association  or aaia  the diy category represents an approximate billion market with sales to consumers who maintain and repair vehicles themselves 
per the aaia  the difm category represents an approximate billion market with sales to professional installers  such as independent garages  service stations and auto dealers 
difm parts and services are typically offered to vehicle owners who are less inclined to repair their vehicles themselves 
the difm category includes an approximate billion market which includes dealer purchases directly from the original equipment manufacturers 
we believe the united states automotive aftermarket industry will benefit from several favorable trends  including the increasing number and age of vehicles in the united states  increasing number of miles driven annually  and increasing number of cars coming off of warranty  particularly previously leased vehicles  higher cost of replacement parts as a result of technological changes in recent models of vehicles and increasing number of light trucks and sport utility vehicles that require more expensive parts  resulting in higher average sales per customer  continued consolidation of automotive aftermarket retailers  move to higher priced premium parts  which offer enhanced features  benefits and or warranties  and market share growth opportunities for specialty retailers relative to other channels selling similar merchandise

risk factors 
risks relating to our business we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy  including increasing comparable store sales  enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have implemented numerous initiatives to increase comparable store sales  enhance our margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow 
if these initiatives are unsuccessful  or if we are unable to implement the initiatives efficiently and effectively  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control 
adverse changes in the following factors 
table of contents could undermine our business strategy general economic conditions and conditions in our local markets  which could reduce our sales  the competitive environment in the automotive aftermarket parts and accessories retail sector that may force us to reduce prices beyond our normal control or increase promotional spending  changes in the automotive aftermarket parts manufacturing industry  such as consolidation  which may disrupt or sever one or more of our vendor relationships  our ability to anticipate and meet changes in consumer preferences for automotive products  accessories and services in a timely manner  and our continued ability to hire and retain qualified personnel  which depends in part on the types of recruiting  training  compensation and benefit programs we adopt or maintain 
we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not successful  which could negatively impact our financial results 
we have increased our store count significantly from  stores at the end of to  stores at december  we intend to continue to expand our base of stores as part of our growth strategy  primarily by opening new stores 
there can be no assurance that the implementation of this strategy will be successful 
the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors  including  among other things our ability to manage the expansion and hire  train and retain qualified sales associates  the availability of potential store locations in highly visible  well trafficked areas  and the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales 
the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on our ability to properly merchandise  market and price the products required in their respective markets 
furthermore  we may acquire stores or businesses from  make investments in  or enter into strategic alliances with  companies that have stores or distribution networks in our current markets or in areas into which we intend to expand our presence 
any future acquisitions  investments  strategic alliances or related efforts will be accompanied by risks  including the difficulty of identifying appropriate strategic partners or acquisition candidates  the difficulty of assimilating and integrating the operations of the respective entities  the potential disruption to our ongoing business and diversion of our management s attention  the inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  and the impairment of relationships with team members and customers as a result of changes in management 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with these acquisitions  investments  strategic alliances or related efforts 
if overall demand for products sold by our stores slows  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow for any number of reasons  including the weather  as vehicle maintenance may be deferred during periods of unfavorable weather  the economy  as during periods of good economic conditions  more of our diy customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars instead of working on their own cars 
in periods of declining economic conditions  both diy and difm customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair  and the decline of the average age of vehicles  miles driven or number of cars on the road may result in a 
table of contents reduction in the demand for our product offerings 
if any of these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
we depend on the services of many qualified team members and may not be able to attract and retain such qualified team members 
our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our many team members 
at february   we employed  team members 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current qualified team members as well as attract and retain additional qualified team members that may be needed in the future 
our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package 
if we fail to maintain such a package  our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry  we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 
the sale of automotive parts  accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways  including location  price  name recognition and customer service 
we compete in both the diy and difm categories of the automotive aftermarket industry  and primarily with national and regional retail automotive parts chains  discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products  wholesalers or jobber stores  independent operators and automobile dealers that supply parts 
these competitors and the level of competition vary by market 
some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share  including a greater amount of marketing activities  a larger number of stores  longer operating histories  greater name recognition or larger and more established customer bases 
our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices beyond our normal control or increase our promotional spending  which would lower revenue and profitability 
competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines or require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies 
if we do not have the resources or expertise or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages  we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 
disruptions in our relationships with vendors or in our vendors operations could increase our cost of goods sold 
our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and upon the vendors ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms 
many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms 
for example  financial or operational difficulties that some of our vendors may face may increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or the ability for us to source product from them 
in addition  the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers may disrupt or end our relationship with some vendors  and could lead to less competition and  consequently  higher prices 
because we are involved in litigation from time to time  and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations  we could incur substantial judgments  fines  legal fees and other costs 
we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers  employees or other third parties for various actions 
from time to time  we are involved in litigation involving claims related to  among other things  breach of contract  tortious conduct  employment discrimination  asbestos exposure  real estate matters and product defects 
the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial 
although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims  if one or more of the claims greatly exceeds our coverage limits or our insurance policies do not cover a claim  it could have a material adverse affect on our business and operating results 

table of contents additionally  we are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to employment matters  environmental protection and building and zoning requirements 
if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations  we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions 
in addition  our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 
risks relating to our financial condition the covenants governing our revolving credit facility impose restrictions on us 
the terms of our revolving credit facility impose operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain financial tests 
these restrictions may also have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations by significantly limiting or prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions  including incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness  making capital expenditures and other investments  incurring liens on our assets and engaging in sale leaseback transactions  issuing or selling capital stock of our subsidiaries  transferring or selling assets currently held by us  engaging in transactions with affiliates  entering into any agreements that restrict dividends from our subsidiaries  and engaging in mergers or acquisitions 
the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under our revolving credit facility 
furthermore  our revolving credit facility contains certain financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum coverage ratio  which  if not maintained by us  will cause us to be in default under our revolving credit facility 
any of these defaults  if not waived  could result in the acceleration of all of our debt  in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable 
if this occurs  we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it 
even if new financing were available  it may be on terms that are less favorable or otherwise not acceptable to us

our western auto subsidiary  together with other defendants including automobile manufacturers  automotive parts manufacturers and other retailers  has been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestos containing products 
we and some of our other subsidiaries also have been named as defendants in many of these lawsuits 
the plaintiffs have alleged that these products were manufactured  distributed and or sold by the various defendants 
to date  these products have included brake and clutch parts and roofing materials 
many of the cases pending against us or our subsidiaries are in the early stages of litigation 
the damages claimed against the defendants in some of these proceedings are substantial 
additionally  some of the automotive parts manufacturers named as defendants in these lawsuits have declared bankruptcy  which will limit plaintiffs ability to recover monetary damages from those defendants 
although we diligently defend against these claims  we may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits  and may enter into settlement agreements  if we believe settlement is in the best interests of our shareholders 
we also believe that most of these claims are at least partially covered by insurance 
based on discovery to date  we do not believe the cases currently pending will have a material adverse effect on us 
however  if we were to incur an adverse verdict in one or more of these claims and were ordered to pay damages that were not covered by insurance  these claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial position and liquidity 
if the number of claims filed against us or any of our subsidiaries alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestos containing products increases substantially  the costs associated with concluding these claims  including damages resulting from any adverse verdicts  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial position and liquidity in future periods

introduction we primarily operate within the united states automotive aftermarket industry  which includes replacement parts excluding tires  accessories  maintenance items  batteries and automotive chemicals for cars and light trucks pickup trucks  vans  minivans and sport utility vehicles 
we currently are the second largest specialty retailer of automotive parts  accessories and maintenance items to do it yourself  or diy  customers in the united states  based on store count and sales 
at december   we operated  stores throughout states 
we operate in two reportable segments advance auto parts  or aap  and autopart international  or ai 
the aap segment is comprised of our store operations within the united states  puerto rico and the virgin islands which operate under the trade names advance auto parts  discount advance auto parts and western auto 
at december   we operated  stores in the aap segment  of which  stores operated under the trade names advance auto parts and discount advance auto parts throughout states in the northeastern  southeastern and midwestern regions of the united states 
these stores offer automotive replacement parts  accessories and maintenance items  with no significant concentration in any specific product area 
in addition  we operated stores under the western auto and advance auto parts trade names  located primarily in puerto rico and the virgin islands 
the western auto stores offer automotive tires and service in addition to automotive parts  accessories and maintenance items 
at december   we operated stores in the ai segment under the autopart international trade name 
we acquired ai in september  and ai operates as an independent  wholly owned subsidiary 
ai s business primarily serves the commercial market from its store locations 
in addition  its north american sales division services warehouse distributors and jobbers throughout north america 
the following table sets forth the total number of new  closed and relocated stores and stores with commercial delivery programs during fiscal  and we lease approximately of our stores

b of the new stores in  stores were acquired in september as a result of our ai acquisition 
we anticipate adding approximately to aap and ai stores during management overview we recorded earnings per diluted share of in fiscal compared to for fiscal these results were primarily driven by increased sales and higher gross margin dollars offset by an increase in certain fixed operating expenses 
although sales did not meet our expectation for  our average sales per store did reach the industry leading level of million per store 
additionally  our operating results for fiscal include the recognition of of share based compensation expense per diluted share required by the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r  on january we believe the macroeconomic environment negatively impacted our business throughout much of and resulted in weakening trends in our results compared to we believe our customers have been adversely impacted by rising energy prices  higher insurance and interest rates  and larger required minimum payments on their credit card balances  which limit their current ability to spend 
we have established a high priority of examining our operating expenses  including both corporate and store level  in light of our sales trends 
we believe we can continue to be more efficient in our corporate level expenses by optimizing a number of job functions  examining discretionary expenses and re evaluating all third party service providers 
second  we continue to examine our non sales activities in our stores and the impact of those activities on our operating expenses due to the exponential impact that small changes can have on a large chain of stores such as rolling out energy management systems to a significant number of our stores 
in addition  we are evaluating a number of administrative procedures performed by our store team members in an effort to better optimize their time 
we believe our results do reflect the progress made on the following key initiatives that focus specifically on driving higher sales per store improving store execution with a focus on customer service  
table of contents continued execution of our category management program  including direct importing  continued implementation of our store remodeling program at a more selective pace now that more than of our chain has been remodeled  our focus on making our supply chain more responsive and improving our in stock position  consistent growth and execution of our commercial program  including the optimization of delivery vehicles  our focus on recruiting  training and retaining high performing team members  especially those who are ase certified and or bilingual  and enhanced merchandising and marketing programs 
additionally  we believe the factors that favorably impact our industry continue to remain strong 
customers can only defer necessary maintenance on their automobiles for so long  and we continue to educate customers about the value of performing certain types of maintenance and enhancements 
government data recently revealed that consumers are driving their automobiles more  which leads to a greater need for maintenance 
the growing population of light trucks and sport utility vehicles are also beginning to hit the average age where we believe they will need certain repairs  including overall more expensive  replacement parts 
we believe the combination of these favorable industry dynamics along with the continued execution of our key business initiatives along with our more recent effort to examine operating expenses will allow us to achieve each of the following goals raising average sales per store  expanding operating margin  increasing free cash flow  and increasing return on invested capital

the footnotes contain descriptions regarding the calculation of these metrics 
key milestones the following key milestones occurred during we opened our  th store  in the aap segment  we surpassed the billion mark in commercial sales  
table of contents we completed the refinancing of our previous secured credit facility to an unsecured revolving credit facility  and on february   our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend  the first in our history 
refinancing on october   we entered into a new million unsecured five year revolving credit facility 
this new facility replaced the term loans and revolver under our previous secured credit facility 
initial proceeds from this revolving loan were used to repay million of principal outstanding on the term loans and revolver under our previous credit facility 
as a result of the improved borrowing costs under the new facility  we anticipate pre tax interest expense savings of more than million annually 
in conjunction with this refinancing  we wrote off existing deferred financing costs related to our previous term loans and revolver 
the write off of these costs of million was combined with a related gain on settlement of interest rate swaps of million for a net gain on extinguishment of debt of million 
stock repurchase program during fiscal  we repurchased million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of million  or an average price of per share  excluding related expenses 
our stock repurchase program  as authorized by our board of directors in fiscal  authorizes us to repurchase up to million of our common stock plus related expenses 
the program allows us to repurchase our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time in accordance with the requirements of the securities and exchange commission 
as of december   we had million  excluding related expenses  remaining for future stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program 
commercial program as indicated in the preceding operating results table  our commercial program produced solid revenues in our aap stores during fiscal we attribute this performance to the execution of our commercial plan  which consists of targeting commercial customers with a hard parts focus  targeting commercial customers who need access to a wide selection of inventory  moving inventory closer to our commercial customers to ensure quicker deliveries  growing our market share of the commercial market through internal growth and selected acquisitions  providing trained parts experts to assist commercial customers merchandise selections  shifting commercial delivery vehicles or other commercial resources to store locations where they can be most productive  and providing credit solutions to our commercial customers through our commercial credit program 
commercial sales represented approximately of our consolidated total sales for the fiscal year compared to almost in fiscal  including ai 
at december   we operated commercial programs in of our stores  including the ai stores  up from approximately at the end of the prior fiscal year 
we continued to approach our goal of operating commercial programs in approximately of our aap store base 
due to ai s sole focus on the commercial business  virtually all of their sales are to commercial customers 
we believe we have the opportunity to grow our commercial business for the foreseeable future through the continued execution of our commercial plan and growth in our commercial programs 
we believe the acquisition of ai supplements our commercial growth due to ai s established delivery programs and knowledge of the commercial industry  particularly for foreign makes and models of vehicles 
share based payments on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
and subsequently issued stock option related guidance 
we elected to use the modified prospective method of implementation 
under this transition method  share based compensation expense 
table of contents for fiscal year ended included compensation expense for all share based awards granted subsequent to january  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r  and compensation expense for all share based awards granted prior to but unvested as of january  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with original provisions of sfas no 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to value all options and straight line method to amortize this fair value as compensation cost over the requisite service period 
total share based compensation expense included in selling  general and administrative expenses in our statements of operations for the fiscal years ended was million 
the related income tax benefit was million 
we recognized and million of share based compensation expense in accordance with apb no 
for the fiscal years ended december  and january  on a pro forma basis  share based compensation was and per diluted share for the fiscal years ended december  and january   respectively 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method of sfas no 
r  we have not restated prior periods 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
r on january   our earnings before income tax expense and net earnings for the fiscal year ended december   were million and million lower  respectively  than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb no 
the related impact in to basic and diluted earnings per share is for the fiscal year ended december as of december   we have million of unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested fixed stock options we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years 
ai acquisition the company finalized the allocation of the purchase price of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of autopart international during the third quarter of fiscal we acquired ai in september the acquisition  which included stores throughout new england and new york  a distribution center and ai s wholesale distribution business  complements our growing presence in the northeast 
ai serves the growing commercial market in addition to warehouse distributors and jobbers 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  ai s results of operations have been included in our consolidated statement of operations since the acquisition date 
the total purchase price of million primarily consisted of million paid upon closing and an additional million of contingent consideration paid in march based upon ai satisfying certain earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization targets met through december  the completion of the purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of million in goodwill and million of identifiable intangible assets 
furthermore  an additional million is contingently payable based upon the achievement of certain synergies through fiscal  which will be reflected in the statement of operations as earned 
we recognized additional cost of sales of million in fiscal due to such synergies 
hurricane and fire impact during the second half of fiscal  hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma impacted our operations throughout the states of alabama  florida  louisiana  mississippi and texas 
at the time these storms hit  we operated approximately stores throughout these states 
over of these locations experienced some kind of physical damage and even more suffered sales disruptions 
additionally  we believe we experienced sales disruptions resulting from the economic impact of increased fuel prices on our customer base throughout all of our markets immediately following these hurricanes 
we also incurred and recognized incremental expenses associated with compensating our team members for scheduled work hours for which stores were closed and food and supplies provided to our team members and their families 
while these sales disruptions and related incremental expenses are not recoverable from our insurance carrier  the insurance coverage provides for the recovery of physical damage at cost  damaged merchandise at retail values and damaged capital assets at replacement cost 
additionally  during fiscal we lost two store locations due to fire 
for fiscal  we estimated and reflected in earnings million of insurance recoveries  net of deductibles  for the fixed costs of all damage 
a portion of these recoveries included the settlement with our insurance carrier for the retail value of certain damaged inventory 
in fiscal  we lost one store location due to fire and received additional recoveries as we settled additional hurricane claims for 
table of contents damaged inventory at retail value and for damaged capital assets at replacement value 
accordingly  earnings for fiscal reflected million of insurance recoveries  net of deductibles 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america 
our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates 
vendor incentives we receive incentives from vendors as a result of purchasing and promoting their products through a variety of programs  including cooperative advertising allowances  volume rebates and other promotional incentives 
we account for vendor incentives in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
many of the incentives are under long term agreements terms in excess of one year  while others are negotiated on an annual basis 
cooperative advertising allowances and volume rebates are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory 
the deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold 
we recognize other promotional incentives earned under long term agreements as a reduction to cost of sales 
these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement 
our margins could be impacted positively or negatively if actual purchases or results from any one year differ from our estimates  however  the impact over the life of the agreement would be the same 
short term incentives terms less than one year are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the course of the agreements 
amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue 
management s estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities 
earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables except for that portion expected to be received after one year  which is included in other assets 
inventory reserves we establish reserves for inventory shrink  as an increase to our cost of sales  for our stores and distribution centers based on our extensive and frequent cycle counting program 
our estimates of these shrink reserves depend on the accuracy of the program  which is dependent on compliance rates of our facilities and the execution of the required procedures 
we evaluate the accuracy of this program on an ongoing basis and believe it provides reasonable assurance for the established reserves 
if estimates regarding our cycle counting program are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
we have recorded reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on current inventory levels and historical analysis of product sales and current market conditions 
the nature of our inventory is such that the risk of obsolescence is minimal and excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit 
we provide reserves where less than full credit is expected from a vendor or where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded cost 
we develop these estimates based on the determination of return privileges with vendors  the level of credit provided by the vendor and management s estimate of the discounts to recorded cost  if any  required by market conditions 
future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
a difference in actual inventory reserves at december  would have affected net income by approximately million 

table of contents warranty reserves our vendors are primarily responsible for warranty claims 
we are responsible for merchandise sold under warranty which is not covered by vendor warranties primarily batteries 
we record a reserve for future warranty claims as an increase in our cost of sales based on current sales of the warranted products and historical claim experience 
if claims experience differs from historical levels  revisions in our estimates may be required  which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
a change in the warranty reserves at december  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  self insured reserves we are self insured for general and automobile liability  workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members  although we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total liability exposure 
a reserve for liabilities associated with these losses is established for claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience 
while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates  our self insurance reserves and corresponding selling  general and administrative expenses could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions 
a change in our self insurance liabilities at december  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  leases and leasehold improvements we lease certain store locations  distribution centers  office space  equipment and vehicles 
we account for our leases under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for leases  and subsequent amendments which require that leases be evaluated and classified as operating leases or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
certain leases contain rent escalation clauses  which are recorded on a straight line basis over the initial term of the lease with the difference between the rent paid and the straight line rent recorded as a deferred rent liability 
lease incentive payments received from landlords are recorded as deferred rent liabilities and are amortized on a straight line basis over the lease term as a reduction in rent 
in addition  leasehold improvements associated with these operating leases are amortized over the shorter of their economic lives or the respective lease terms 
the term of each lease is generally the initial term of the lease unless external economic factors were to exist such that renewals potentially provided for in the lease are reasonably assured to be exercised 
in those instances the renewal period would be included in the lease term for purposes of establishing an amortization period and determining if such lease qualified as a capital or operating lease 
impairment of long lived assets we primarily invest in property and equipment in connection with the opening and remodeling of stores and in computer software and hardware 
we periodically review our store locations and estimate the recoverability of our assets  recording an impairment charge  if necessary  when we decide to close the store or otherwise determine that future undiscounted cash flows associated with those assets will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value 
this determination is based on a number of factors  including the store s historical operating results and cash flows  estimated future sales growth  real estate development in the area and perceived local market conditions that can be difficult to predict and may be subject to change 
in addition  we regularly evaluate our computer related and other long lived assets and may accelerate depreciation over the revised useful life if the asset is expected to be replaced or has limited future value 
when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of  the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts  and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for that period 
our impairment loss calculations require management to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to additional impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

table of contents tax reserves the determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax code  regulations and pronouncements of the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business 
our income tax returns are periodically examined by those jurisdictions 
these examinations include  among other things  auditing our filing positions  the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions 
at any particular time  multiple years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
in evaluating our income tax positions  we record reserves for potential exposures 
these contingency reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to such change 
those developments could be  but are not limited to  settlement of tax audits  expiration of the statute of limitations  and the evolution of tax code and regulations  along with varying application of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions 
these contingency reserves contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing positions 
although management believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ and the company may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates  the effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected 
favorable tax developments would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution 
share based payments we have a share based compensation plan  which includes fixed stock options and deferred stock units  or dsus 
we account for our share based compensation plans as prescribed by the fair value provisions of sfas no 
r 
we determine the fair value of our stock options at the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the dsus are awarded at a price equal to the market price of our underlying stock on the date of the grant 
the option pricing model and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include the expected life of stock options  expected stock price volatility  future employee stock option exercise behaviors and the estimate of stock option forfeitures 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are different from these assumptions  the share based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the share based compensation 
in addition  significant changes in these assumptions could materially impact our share based compensation expense on future awards 
a change in our share based compensation expense for the fiscal year ended december  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  components of statement of operations net sales net sales consist primarily of comparable store sales and new store net sales 
we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in net sales starting once a store has been opened for complete accounting periods 
we include relocations in comparable store sales from the original date of opening 
we exclude net sales from the western auto retail stores from our comparable store sales as a result of their unique product offerings 
we also exclude the net sales from the ai stores from our comparable store sales 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to december and consists of or weeks 
our fiscal year began on january  and consisted of weeks  while our fiscal year began on december  and consisted of weeks 
the extra week of operations in fiscal resulted in our fiscal consisting of non comparable calendar weeks to fiscal to create a meaningful comparable store sales measure for fiscal  we have compared the calendar weeks of to the corresponding calendar weeks of fiscal accordingly  our calculation of comparable stores sales for fiscal excludes week one of operations from fiscal 
table of contents cost of sales our cost of sales consists of merchandise costs  net of incentives under vendor programs  inventory shrinkage and warehouse and distribution expenses 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by variations in our product mix  price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs and vendor programs 
we seek to avoid fluctuation in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into long term purchasing agreements with vendors when we believe it is advantageous 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist of store payroll  store occupancy including rent  advertising expenses  other store expenses and general and administrative expenses  including salaries and related benefits of store support center team members  store support center administrative office expenses  data processing  professional expenses and other related expenses 
consolidated results of operations the following table sets forth certain of our operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended december  december  january  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt other income  net income tax expense income from continuing operations before discontinued operations discontinued operations loss income from operations of discontinued wholesale distribution network benefit provision for income taxes loss income on discontinued operations net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for were  million  an increase of million  or  over net sales for the net sales increase was due to an increase in comparable store sales of  contributions from the aap stores opened within the last year and sales from ai 
ai  which was acquired in september  produced sales of million in compared to million for the partial period in the comparable store sales increase was driven by an increase in average ticket sales and customer traffic in our difm business and an increase in average ticket sales by our diy customers offset by a decrease in diy customer count

in addition  we have used available funds to repurchase shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program and to pay quarterly cash dividends beginning in we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities as needed 
we believe funds generated from our expected results of operations  available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next fiscal year 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents balance was million  a decrease of million compared to fiscal year end our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased primarily due to the repurchase of common stock  dividends paid to our shareholders and an overall net increase in working capital during as compared to at december   we had outstanding indebtedness consisting of borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility  an increase of million from additionally  we had million in letters of credit outstanding  which reduced our cash availability under the revolving credit facility to million

our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number of and timing for new stores we open or acquire within a given year and the number of stores we relocate or remodel 
during  we anticipate adding to new aap and ai stores  remodeling aap stores and relocating aap stores 
our new aap stores  if 
table of contents leased  require capital expenditures of approximately million per store 
our remodeled stores generally require capital expenditures of approximately million per store  which reflects a forty percent reduction from levels

in  we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately million to million  inclusive of approximately million for the construction of our new midwest distribution center scheduled to open in mid additionally  our new aap stores require an inventory investment of approximately million per store  net of vendor payables 
a portion of the inventory investment is held at a distribution facility 
pre opening expenses  consisting primarily of store set up costs and training of new store team members  average approximately million per store and are expensed when incurred 
vendor financing program historically  we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers that help finance inventory growth  and we believe that we will be able to continue financing much of our inventory growth through such extended payment terms 
in fiscal  we entered into a short term financing program with a bank for certain merchandise purchases 
in substance  the program allows us to borrow money from the bank to finance purchases from our vendors 
this program allows us to reduce further our working capital invested in current inventory levels and finance future inventory growth 
our new revolving credit facility does not restrict availability under this program

deferred compensation and postretirement plans we maintain a non qualified deferred compensation plan established for certain of our key team members 
this plan provides for a minimum and maximum deferral percentage of the team member base salary and bonus  as determined by our retirement plan committee 
we fund the plan liability by remitting the team members deferrals to a rabbi trust where these deferrals are invested in certain life insurance contracts 
accordingly  the cash surrender value on these contracts is held in the rabbi trust to fund the deferred compensation liability 
at december   the liability related to this plan was million  all of which is current 
we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired team members through our postretirement plan 
at december   our accrued benefit cost related to this plan was million

long term debt on october   we entered into a new million unsecured five year revolving credit facility with our subsidiary  advance stores company  incorporated  serving as the borrower 
this new facility replaced the term loans and revolver under our previous credit facility 
proceeds from this revolving loan were used to repay million of principal outstanding on the term loans and revolver under our previous credit facility 
in conjunction with this refinancing  we wrote off existing deferred financing costs related to our previous term loans and revolver 
the million write off of these costs was combined with a related gain on settlement of interest rate swaps of million for a net gain on extinguishment of debt of million 
additionally  the new facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sub limit of million and swingline loans in an amount not to exceed million 
we may request that the total revolving commitment be increased by an amount not exceeding million during the term of the credit agreement 
voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of the revolving balance are permitted in whole or in part  at our option  in minimum principal amounts as specified in the new revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had borrowed million under the revolver and had million in letters of credit outstanding  which reduced availability under the revolver to million
