regulation and supervision the company expects competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry 
technological advances  for example  have lowered barriers to entry  allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the internet and made it possible for non depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks 
changes in federal law permit affiliation among banks  securities firms and insurance companies  which promotes a competitive environment in the financial services industry 
competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit the company s growth in the future

dividends 
the federal reserve board has the power to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices 
the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies  which expresses the federal reserve board s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the company s capital needs  asset quality and overall financial condition 
the federal reserve board also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a bank holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends 
under the prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the federal reserve board  the federal reserve board may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company s bank subsidiary is classified as undercapitalized 
see regulation and supervision of the bank prompt corrective regulatory action 
stock repurchases 
as a bank holding company  the company is required to give the federal reserve board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption  when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding months  is equal to or more of the company s consolidated net worth 
the federal reserve board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would violate any law  regulation  federal reserve board order  directive  or any condition imposed by  or written agreement with  the federal reserve board 
this requirement does not apply to bank holding companies that are well capitalized  well managed and are not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues 
acquisitions 
the company is required to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve board to acquire all  or substantially all  of the assets of any bank or bank holding company or merge with another bank holding company 
prior federal reserve board approval will also be required for the company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if  after giving effect to such acquisition  the company would  directly or indirectly  own or control more than of any class of voting shares of such bank or bank holding company 
in evaluating such transactions  the federal reserve board considers such matters as the financial and managerial resources of and future prospects of the companies involved  competitive factors and the convenience and needs of the communities to be served 
bank holding companies may acquire additional banks in any state  subject to certain restrictions such as deposit concentration limits 
with certain exceptions  the bhca prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of a company that is not a bank or a bank holding company  or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking  managing or controlling banks  or providing services for its subsidiaries 
the principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain non bank activities  which  by statute or by federal reserve board regulation or order  have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking 
the activities of the company are subject to these legal and regulatory limitations under the bhca and the related federal reserve board regulations 
the gramm leach bliley act of authorized a bank holding company that meets specified conditions  including being well capitalized and well managed  to opt to become a financial holding company  and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities than previously permitted 
such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking 
the federal reserve board has the power to order a holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity  or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary  when it has reasonable cause to believe that the continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that holding company 
under the change in bank control act of the cbca  a day prior written notice must be submitted to the federal reserve board if any person including a company  or any group acting in concert  seeks to acquire of any class of the company s outstanding voting securities  unless the federal reserve board determines that such acquisition will not result in a change of control of the bank 
under the cbca  the federal reserve board has days within which to act on such notice taking into consideration certain factors  including the financial and managerial resources of the proposed acquiror  the convenience and needs of the community served by the bank and the antitrust effects of an acquisition 
under the bhca  any company would be required to obtain prior approval from the federal reserve board before it may obtain control of the company within the meaning of the bhca 
control for bhca purposes generally is defined to mean the ownership or power to vote percent or more of any class of the company s voting securities or the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of the company s directors 
an existing bank holding company would be required to obtain the federal reserve board s prior approval under the bhca before acquiring more than of the company s voting stock 
under indiana banking law  prior approval of the indiana department of financial institutions is also required before any person may acquire control of an indiana stock savings bank  bank or bank holding company 
the department will issue a notice approving the transaction if it determines that the persons proposing to acquire the savings bank  bank or bank holding company are qualified in character  experience and financial responsibility  and the transaction does not jeopardize the interests of the public 
capital requirements 
the federal reserve board has adopted guidelines regarding the capital adequacy of bank holding companies  which require bank holding companies to maintain specified minimum ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk weighted assets 
these requirements are substantially similar to those applicable to the bank 
see regulation and supervision of the bank capital requirements 
regulation and supervision of the bank general 
the bank is subject to extensive regulation by the indiana department of financial institutions and the fdic 
the lending activities and other investments of the bank must comply with various regulatory requirements 
the indiana department of financial institutions and fdic periodically examine the bank for compliance with various regulatory requirements 
the bank must file reports with the indiana department of financial institutions and the fdic describing its activities and financial condition 
the bank is also subject to certain reserve requirements promulgated by the federal reserve board 
this supervision and regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors 
certain of these regulatory requirements are referred to below or appear elsewhere in this form k 
the regulatory discussion  however  does not purport to be an exhaustive treatment of applicable laws and regulations and is qualified in its entirety be reference to the actual statutes and regulations 
federal banking law capital requirements 
under fdic regulations  state chartered banks that are not members of the federal reserve system are required to maintain a minimum leverage capital requirement consisting of a ratio of tier capital to total assets of if the fdic determines that the institution is not anticipating or experiencing significant growth and has well diversified risk  including no undue interest rate risk exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity  good earnings  and in general  a strong banking organization  rated composite under the uniform financial institutions rating system the camels rating system established by the federal financial institutions examination council 
for all but the most highly rated institutions meeting the conditions set forth above  the minimum leverage capital ratio is 
tier capital is the sum of common stockholders equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock including any related surplus and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries  minus all intangible assets other than certain mortgage servicing assets  purchased credit card relationships  credit enhancing interest only strips and certain deferred tax assets  identified losses  investments in certain financial subsidiaries and non financial equity investments 
in addition to the leverage capital ratio the ratio of tier i capital to total assets  state chartered nonmember banks must maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of at least  of which at least half must be tier capital 
qualifying total capital consists of tier capital plus tier capital also referred to as supplementary capital items 
tier capital items include allowances for loan losses in an amount of up to of risk weighted assets  cumulative preferred stock and preferred stock with a maturity of over years  certain other capital instruments and up to of pre tax net unrealized holding gains on equity securities 
the includable amount of tier capital cannot exceed the institution s tier capital 
qualifying total capital is further reduced by the amount of the bank s investments in banking and finance subsidiaries that are not consolidated for regulatory capital purposes  reciprocal cross holdings of capital securities issued by other banks  most intangible assets and certain other deductions 
under the fdic risk weighted system  all of a bank s balance sheet assets and the credit equivalent amounts of certain off balance sheet items are assigned to one of four broad risk weight categories from to  based on the risks inherent in the type of assets or item 
the aggregate dollar amount of each category is multiplied by the risk weight assigned to that category 
the sum of these weighted values equals the bank s risk weighted assets 
at december   the bank s ratio of tier capital to total assets was  its ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets was and its ratio of total risk based capital to risk weighted assets was 
during the second quarter of  the bank entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with the fdic and the dfi 
among other things  the mou required the bank to adopt written action plans with respect to certain classified assets  revise its lending policies  require greater financial information from borrowers  establish a loan review program and certain other internal controls 
the fdic and the dfi released the bank from the mou during the third quarter of the release of the mou was contingent on the bank s adoption of a resolution that required the bank to continue reducing the level of assets as substandard  formulate and implement a written profit plan  abstain from purchasing additional bank owned life insurance policies  formalize policies for leveraging strategies and maintain tier capital at or above of assets 
the bank adopted the resolution on june  on june   the bank was released from the provisions of the board resolution 
accordingly  the resolution is no longer in effect 
investment activities 
since the enactment of federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act  all state chartered fdic insured banks  including savings banks  have generally been limited in their investment activities to principal and equity investments of the type and in the amount authorized for national banks  notwithstanding state law 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act and the fdic regulations permit exceptions to these limitations 
the fdic is authorized to permit such institutions to engage in state authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks other than non subsidiary equity investments if they meet all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the bank insurance fund 
the fdic has adopted regulations governing the procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments 
the gramm leach bliley act of specifies that a non member bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a financial subsidiary if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes 
interstate banking and branching 
the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of  permits adequately capitalized bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state subject to specified concentration limits and other conditions 
the interstate banking act also authorizes the interstate merger of banks 
in addition  among other things  the interstate banking act permits banks to establish new branches on an interstate basis provided that such action is specifically authorized by the law of the host state 
dividend limitations 
the bank may not pay dividends on its capital stock if its regulatory capital would thereby be reduced below the amount then required for the liquidation account established for the benefit of certain depositors of the bank at the time of its conversion to stock form 
in addition  the bank may not pay dividends that exceed retained net income for the applicable calendar year to date  plus retained net income for the preceding two years without prior approval from the indiana department of financial institutions 
at december   the shareholder s equity of the bank was million 
earnings of the bank appropriated to bad debt reserves and deducted for federal income tax purposes are not available for payment of cash dividends or other distributions to stockholders without payment of taxes at the then current tax rate by the bank on the amount of earnings removed from the reserves for such distributions 
see federal and state taxation 
under fdic regulations  the bank is prohibited from making any capital distributions if  after making the distribution  the bank would have i a total risk based capital ratio of less than  ii a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or iii a leverage ratio of less than 
for additional information about dividend limitations see note in the consolidated financial statements 
insurance of deposit accounts 
the bank s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund of the fdic 
the deposit insurance fund is the successor to the bank insurance fund and the savings association insurance fund  which were merged in the fdic recently amended its risk based assessment system for to implement authority granted by the federal deposit insurance reform act of reform act 
under the revised system  insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations  regulatory capital levels and certain other factors 
an institution s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned 
risk category i  which contains the least risky depository institutions  is expected to include more than of all institutions 
unlike the other categories  risk category i contains further risk differentiation based on the fdic s analysis of financial ratios  examination component ratings and other information 
assessment rates are determined by the fdic and currently range from five to seven basis points for the healthiest institutions risk category i to basis points of assessable deposits for the riskiest risk category iv 
the fdic may adjust rates uniformly from one quarter to the next  except that no single adjustment can exceed three basis points 
no institution may pay a dividend if in default of the fdic assessment 
the reform act also provided for a one time credit for eligible institutions based on their assessment base as of december  subject to certain limitations with respect to institutions that are exhibiting weaknesses  credits can be used to offset assessments until exhausted 
the bank s one time credit is expected to approximate  the reform act also provided for the possibility that the fdic may pay dividends to insured institutions once the deposit insurance fund reserve ratio equals or exceeds of estimated insured deposits 
in addition to the assessment for deposit insurance  institutions are required to make payments on bonds issued in the late s by the financing corporation to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund 
this payment is established quarterly and during the calendar year ending december  averaged basis points of assessable deposits 
the reform act provided the fdic with authority to adjust the deposit insurance fund ratio to insured deposits within a range of and  in contrast to the prior statutorily fixed ratio of 
the ratio  which is viewed by the fdic as the level that the fund should achieve  was established by the agency at for the fdic has authority to increase insurance assessments 
a significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the bank 
management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future 
insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic 
the management of the bank does not know of any practice  condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance 
prompt corrective regulatory action 
the federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action if an insured depository institution fails to satisfy certain minimum capital requirements  including a leverage limit  a risk based capital requirement and any other measure deemed appropriate by the federal banking regulators for measuring the capital adequacy of an insured depository institution 
all institutions  regardless of their capital levels  are restricted from making any capital distribution or paying any management fees if the institution would thereafter fail to satisfy the minimum levels for any of its capital requirements 
an institution that fails to meet the minimum level for any relevant capital measure an undercapitalized institution may be i subject to increased monitoring by the appropriate federal banking regulator  ii required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan within days  iii subject to asset growth limits  and iv required to obtain prior regulatory approval for acquisitions  branching and new lines of businesses 
the capital restoration plan must include a guarantee by the institution s holding company that the institution will comply with the plan until it has been adequately capitalized on average for four consecutive quarters  under which the holding company would be liable up to the lesser of of the institution s total assets or the amount necessary to bring the institution into capital compliance as of the date it failed to comply with its capital restoration plan 
a significantly undercapitalized institution  as well as any undercapitalized institution that does not submit an acceptable capital restoration plan  may be subject to regulatory demands for recapitalization  broader application of restrictions on transactions with affiliates  limitations on interest rates paid on deposits  asset growth and other activities  possible replacement of directors and officers  and restrictions on capital distributions by any bank holding company controlling the institution 
any company controlling the institution may also be required to divest the institution or the institution could be required to divest subsidiaries 
the senior executive officers of a significantly undercapitalized institution may not receive bonuses or increases in compensation without prior approval and the institution is prohibited from making payments of principal or interest on its subordinated debt 
at their discretion  the federal banking regulators may also impose the foregoing sanctions on an undercapitalized institution if the regulators determine that such actions are necessary to carry out the purposes of the prompt corrective provisions 
if an institution s ratio of tangible capital to total assets falls below the critically undercapitalized level established by law  ie  a ratio of tangible equity to total assets of or less  the institution will be subject to conservatorship or receivership within specified time periods 
tangible equity is defined as core capital plus cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus less all intangible assets other than qualifying supervisory goodwill and certain purchased mortgage servicing rights 
under the implementing regulations  the federal banking regulators generally measure an institution s capital adequacy on the basis of its total risk based capital ratio the ratio of its total capital to risk weighted assets  tier risk based capital ratio the ratio of its core capital to risk weighted assets and leverage ratio the ratio of its core capital to adjusted total assets 
the following table shows the capital ratios required for the various prompt corrective action categories 
well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio or more or more less than less than tier risk based capital ratio or more or more less than less than leverage ratio or more or more less than less than if institution has a composite camels rating 
the fdic may reclassify a well capitalized depository institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory actions applicable to institutions in the next lower capital category but may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized if the fdic determines  after notice and an opportunity for a hearing  that the savings institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or that the institution has received and not corrected a less than satisfactory rating for any camels rating category 
safety and soundness guidelines 
each federal banking agency was required to establish safety and soundness standards for the depository institutions under its authority 
the interagency guidelines require depository institutions to maintain internal controls and information systems and internal audit systems that are appropriate for the size  nature and scope of the institution s business 
the guidelines also establish certain basic standards for loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate risk exposure and asset growth 
the guidelines further provide that depository institutions should maintain safeguards to prevent the payment of compensation  fees and benefits that are excessive or that could lead to material financial loss  and should take into account factors such as compensation practices at comparable institutions 
if the appropriate federal banking agency determines that a depository institution is not in compliance with the safety and soundness guidelines  it may require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the guidelines 
a depository institution must submit an acceptable compliance plan to its primary federal regulator within days of receipt of a request for such a plan 
failure to submit or implement a compliance plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions 
management believes that the bank meets all the standards adopted in the interagency guidelines 
enforcement 
the fdic has extensive enforcement authority over insured state savings banks  including the bank 
this enforcement authority includes  among other things  the ability to assess civil money penalties  issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers 
in general  these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices 
the fdic has authority under federal law to appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured bank under limited circumstances 
the fdic is required  with certain exceptions  to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non member bank if that banks was critically undercapitalized on average during the calendar quarter beginning days after the date on which the institution became critically undercapitalized 
the fdic may also appoint itself as conservator or receiver for an insured state non member institution under specific circumstances on the basis of the institution s financial condition or upon the occurrence of other events  including insolvency  substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices  existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business  and insufficient capital  or the incurring of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance 
reserve requirements 
under federal reserve board regulations  the bank currently must maintain average daily reserves equal to of net transaction accounts over million up to million  plus on the remainder 
this percentage is subject to adjustment by the federal reserve board 
because required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or in a noninterest bearing account at a federal reserve bank  the effect of the reserve requirement is to reduce the amount of the institution s interest earning assets 
at december   the bank met applicable federal reserve board reserve requirements

risk factors an investment in shares of our common stock involves various risks 
before deciding to invest in our common stock  you should carefully consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information in this form k  including the items included as exhibits 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by any of the following risks or by other risks that have not been identified or that we may believe are immaterial or unlikely 
the value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks 
the risks discussed below also include forward looking statements  and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
a significant percentage of our assets are invested in lower yielding investments  which has contributed to our low profitability 
our results of operations are substantially dependent on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on our interest earning assets and the interest expense paid on our interest bearing liabilities 
the low interest rate environment that existed in through mid led to the refinancing of a substantial portion of our one to four family loans 
these loans were subsequently sold to minimize the potential interest rate risk associated with maintaining such long term low interest loans in portfolio 
the proceeds from such loans sales were invested in government agency securities 
additionally  during such period  our residential loan production decreased due to reduced demand in our market area 
accordingly  at december   of our assets were invested in investment and mortgage backed securities 
these investments yield substantially less than the loans we hold in our portfolio 
to counteract this  in  we devoted more resources towards loan production  specifically residential and commercial real estate lending  with the goal of investing a greater proportion of our assets in loans 
we have also made efforts to reduce our cost of funds  through more disciplined and effective pricing strategies  and to reduce our operating expenses  by reducing staffing levels and freezing our pension plan in june during the fourth quarter of  we sold approximately million of available for sale investment securities in order to reduce the company s interest rate risk and reduce the overall level of investments as a percent of total assets to more reasonable levels 
together  these efforts are designed to increase our net interest income 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to increase the origination of loans  successfully reduce our cost of funds or operating expenses or that we will be able to successfully implement this strategy 
certain interest rate movements may hurt our earnings 
between june  and june   the us federal reserve increased its target for the federal funds rate in basis point increments from to 
the increase in the federal funds rate has had the affect of increasing short term market interest rates 
while short term market interest rates which we use as a guide to price our deposits have increased  longer term market interest rates which we use as a guide to price our longer term loans have not 
this flattening and inversion of the market yield curve has had a negative impact on our interest rate spread and net interest margin  which has reduced our profitability 
if short term interest rates continue to rise  and if rates on our deposits continue to reprice upwards faster than the rates on our long term loans and investments  we could continue to experience compression of our interest rate spread and net interest margin  which would have a negative effect on our profitability 
our increased emphasis on commercial and construction lending may expose us to increased lending risks 
at december   our loan portfolio consisted of million  or of commercial real estate loans  million  or of construction loans and million  or of commercial and industrial loans 
we intend to continue to increase our emphasis on the origination of commercial and construction lending 
however  these types of loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non payment and loss than one to four family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property  the income stream of the borrowers and  for construction loans  the accuracy of the estimate of the property s value at completion of construction and the estimated cost of construction 
such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one to four family residential mortgage loans 
commercial and industrial loans expose us to additional risks since they typically are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayments from the cash flow of the borrower s business and are secured by non real estate collateral that may depreciate over time 
in addition  since such loans generally entail greater risk than one to four family residential mortgage loans  we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses in the future to account for the likely increase in probable incurred credit losses associated with the growth of such loans 
also  many of our commercial and construction borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us 
consequently  an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one to four family residential mortgage loan 
our level of non performing loans and classified assets expose us to increased lending risks 
further  our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio 
at december   our non performing loans totaled million  representing of total loans 
in addition  loans that we have classified as either substandard  doubtful or loss totaled million  representing of total loans 
if these loans do not perform according to their terms and the collateral is insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance  we may experience loan losses  which could have a material effect on our operating results 
like all financial institutions  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
we believe that our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date 
however  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses  and future provisions for loan losses could materially adversely affect our operating results 
in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  we consider numerous quantitative factors  including our historical charge off experience  growth of our loan portfolio  changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of delinquent and classified loans 
in addition  we use information about specific borrower situations  including their financial position and estimated collateral values  to estimate the risk and amount of loss for those borrowers 
finally  we also consider many qualitative factors  including general and economic business conditions  current general market collateral valuations  trends apparent in any of the factors we take into account and other matters  which are by nature more subjective and fluid 
our estimates of the risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan are complicated by the significant uncertainties surrounding our borrowers abilities to successfully execute their business models through changing economic environments  competitive challenges and other factors 
because of the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change  our actual losses may vary from our current estimates 
at december   our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 
our regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to expense  or to decrease our allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge offs  net of recoveries 
any such additional provisions for loan losses or charge offs  as required by these regulatory agencies  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our cost of operations is high relative to our assets 
our failure to maintain or reduce our operating expenses costs could hurt our profits 
our operating expenses  which consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  furniture and equipment expense  professional fees and data processing expense  totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  our efficiency ratio totaled for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  we have made a concerted effort to control our expenses and operate more efficiently  through such actions as reducing personnel and freezing of our pension plan 
however  the failure to reduce our expenses could hurt our profits 
strong competition within our market area could hurt our profits and slow growth 
we face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits 
this competition has made it more difficult for us to make new loans and has occasionally forced us to offer higher deposit rates 
price competition for loans and deposits might result in us earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits  which reduces net interest income 
according to the fdic  as of june   we held of the deposits in henry county  indiana  which was the largest market share of deposits out of the four financial institutions that held deposits in this county 
we also held of the deposits in hancock county  indiana  which was the th largest market share of deposits out of the ten financial institutions that held deposits in this county 
some of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide 
we expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry 
our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market area 
if we do not achieve profitability on our new offices  it may negatively impact our earnings 
we opened our mccordsville office in february and plan to open a new loan production office in carmel in mid april numerous factors contribute to the performance of a new office  such as a suitable location  qualified personnel and an effective marketing strategy 
additionally  it takes time for a new office to generate significant deposits and make sufficient loans to produce enough income to offset expenses  some of which  like salaries and occupancy expense  are relatively fixed costs 
we expect that it may take a period of time before the new office can become profitable 
during this period  operating this new office may negatively impact our net income 
if the value of real estate in central indiana were to decline materially  a significant portion of our loan portfolio could become under collateralized  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
with most of our loans concentrated in central indiana  a decline in local economic conditions could adversely affect the value of the real estate collateral securing our loans 
a decline in property values would diminish our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral  making it more likely that we would suffer losses on defaulted loans 
additionally  a decrease in asset quality could require additions to our allowance for loan losses through increased provisions for loan losses  which would hurt our profits 
also  a decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are more geographically diverse 
real estate values are affected by various factors in addition to local economic conditions  including  among other things  changes in general or regional economic conditions  governmental rules or policies and natural disasters 
our business is subject to the success of the local economy in which we operate 
because the majority of our borrowers and depositors are individuals and businesses located and doing business in central indiana our success significantly depends to a significant extent upon economic conditions in central indiana 
adverse economic conditions in our market area could reduce our growth rate  affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans and generally affect our financial condition and results of operations 
conditions such as inflation  recession  unemployment  high interest rates  short money supply  scarce natural resources  international disorders  terrorism and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our profitability 
we are less able than a larger institution to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies 
any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies  foreclosures or losses caused by adverse market or economic conditions in indiana could adversely affect the value of our assets  revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  we cannot give any assurance we will benefit from any market growth or favorable economic conditions in our primary market areas if they do occur 
the trading history of our common stock is characterized by low trading volume 
our common stock may be subject to sudden decreases 
although our common stock trades on nasdaq global market  it has not been regularly traded 
we cannot predict whether a more active trading market in our common stock will occur or how liquid that market might become 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity and orderliness depends upon the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time  which presence is dependent upon the individual decisions of investors  over which we have no control 
the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the factors discussed in other risk factors and the following actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in interest rates  changes in the legal or regulatory environment in which we operate  press releases  announcements or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in our industry  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts and investors  future sales of our common stock  changes in economic conditions in our marketplace  general conditions in the us economy  financial markets or the banking industry  and other developments affecting our competitors or us 
these factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance  and could prevent you from selling your common stock at or above the price you desire 
in addition  the stock markets  from time to time  experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
these broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our trading performance 
we operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations

regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the imposition of restrictions on our operations  the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses 
any change in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of regulatory policy  regulations  legislation or supervisory action  may have a material impact on our operations 
provisions of our articles of incorporation  bylaws and indiana law  as well as state and federal banking regulations  could delay or prevent a takeover of us by a third party 
provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and the corporate law of the state of indiana could delay  defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us  despite the possible benefit to our shareholders  or otherwise adversely affect the price of our common stock 
these provisions include supermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations  the election of directors to staggered terms of three years  and advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that shareholders may act on at shareholder meetings 
in addition  we are subject to indiana laws  including one that prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with any interested shareholder for a period of five years from the date the person became an interested shareholder unless certain conditions are met 
these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts  discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  our common stock

the company is subject to regulation and supervision by the federal reserve bank 
the bank began banking operations in on june   the bank converted to an indiana savings bank and adopted the name  ameriana bank and trust  sb 
in august  the bank closed its trust department and adopted its present name 
the bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic  and the indiana department of financial institutions the dfi 
our deposits are insured to applicable limits by the savings association insurance fund administered by the fdic 
references in this form k to we  us  and our refer to ameriana bancorp and or the bank  as appropriate 
we are headquartered in new castle  indiana 
we conduct business through our main office at bundy avenue  new castle  indiana and through nine branch offices located in new castle  middletown  knightstown  morristown  greenfield  anderson  avon  mccordsville and new palestine  indiana 
the bank has three wholly owned subsidiaries  ameriana insurance agency aia  ameriana financial services  inc afs and ameriana investment management  inc aimi 
aia provides insurance sales from offices in new castle  greenfield and avon  indiana 
afs offers debt protection products through its ownership of an interest in family financial holdings  incorporated  columbus  indiana 
in  afs acquired a ownership interest in indiana title insurance company  llc itic through which it offers title insurance 
afs also operates a brokerage facility in conjunction with linsco private ledger 
aimi manages the bank s investment portfolio 
the company holds a minority interest in a limited partnership  house investments  organized to acquire and manage real estate investments which qualify for federal tax credits 
what we do the bank is a community oriented financial institution 
our principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those funds primarily in mortgage loans on single family residences  multi family  construction loans  commercial real estate loans  and  to a lesser extent  commercial and industrial loans  small business lending  home improvement  and consumer loans 
we have from time to time purchased loans and loan participations in the secondary market 
we also invest in various federal and government agency obligations and other investment securities permitted by applicable laws and regulations  including mortgage backed  municipal and equity securities 
we offer customers in our market area time deposits with terms from three months to seven years  interest bearing and non interest bearing checking accounts  savings accounts and money market accounts 
our primary source of borrowings is federal home loan bank fhlb advances 
through our subsidiaries  we engage in insurance and brokerage activities 
our primary source of income is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on our loan and investment portfolios and the interest expense incurred on our deposits and borrowing portfolios 
our loan portfolio typically earns more interest than the investment portfolio  and our deposits typically have a lower average rate than fhlb advances 
several factors affect our net interest income 
these factors include the loan  investment  deposit  and borrowing portfolio balances  their composition  the length of their maturity  re pricing characteristics  liquidity  credit  and interest rate risk  as well as market and competitive conditions 
financial challenges in recent years since  when we posted net income of million  our company has faced several significant financial challenges 
in  we posted a net loss of million 
this loss was due primarily to security losses and large loan provision expenses 
we disposed of million in securities for a pre tax loss of million 
the securities were sold to address a considerable increase in the bank s interest rate risk primarily due to volatile collateralized mortgage obligations 
we also experienced a decline in credit quality of our loan portfolio which resulted in provision for loan loss of million 
non performing loans grew substantially in to million at december  compared to million at december  the main cause for the increase was related to the two lease pools originated by commercial money center cmc  a now bankrupt company  totaling million  which both went into default 
the bank became involved in a variety of litigation related to these lease pools 
each lease within each pool is supported by a surety bond issued by one of two insurance companies 
both insurance companies denied responsibility for payment 
in addition to the leases  non performing assets included loans to a builder development group and its related parties totaling million 
in  we posted net income of million 
net income during this period included charges totaling million  taken primarily to write off the remainder of the troubled lease portfolio 
these charges were offset to some extent by a gain of million from the sale of two branches in ohio 
unfavorable market conditions since reduced earnings in the employee pension fund and accordingly caused a significant increase in the contribution required by the company 
nonperforming loans were million at december  and consisted primarily of commercial real estate 
in  we posted net income of million 
a decline in net interest income and gains on sale of loans were major factors in the results 
heavy mortgage loan refinancing from to shifted a major portion of our earning assets from loans to lower earning investments 
short term interest rates grew rapidly in the last six months of the year leading to a flattening of the yield curve 
the combination of these two events squeezed our net interest margin 
the slowdown in mortgage loan refinancing resulted in the decline in gains on sale of loans 
we froze the defined benefit pension plan on june  to discontinue accruing benefits to plan participants beyond what was already earned to date and to prevent new participants from entering the plan 
the change was made in an effort to control and reduce pension plan expense in the future 
nonperforming loans were million at december  and consisted primarily of commercial real estate 
our net income was million in  which included significant recoveries from leases charged off in prior periods  offset by a one time large payment towards our pension liability 
we had significant recoveries in  primarily from the two equipment lease pools originated by cmc  a now bankrupt company  that were charged off for million during and the lease recoveries included a million settlement against one of the two sureties for the lease pools and a payment of million received in settlement of the cmc bankruptcy 
the litigation against rli insurance company rli  the other surety for the lease pools  continues 
we also made a million voluntary payment to fund a portion of our pension liability in short term interest rates continued to rise in which led to a flattening yield curve 
as a result  our net interest margin declined to in from in we experienced solid loan growth in  with net loans increasing for the year 
credit quality improved in with a decline in non performing loans of over 
overview of net loss for of  represented a million decrease from net income of million 
a flat and inverted yield curve further squeezed our net interest margin 
we achieved loan growth  primarily in commercial construction real estate loans 
non performing loans increased by  largely due to a residential building project and the purchase of a judgment as part of a work out strategy on a multi family complex 
proved to be a challenging year for the company because of the difficult economic environment and due to issues related to prior years that required resolution 
management made decisions that in some cases had a negative impact on current earnings  but were part of an overall strategic plan that is expected to result in meaningful earnings improvement in and subsequent years 
the substantial decrease to a net loss of  in from net income of million was due primarily to four factors a decline in the net interest margin  resulting mostly from the flattening of the us treasury yield curve and its impact on other market interest rates  management s balance sheet restructuring strategy involving the sale of million of low yielding us government agency securities resulting in a loss of   recorded in as a loss related to the classification of million in investment securities being permanently impaired  and million in recoveries recorded in related to leases charged off in prior periods 
strategic summary overall credit quality in the organization has improved during while non accruals increased  the level of classified loans has declined million or over the prior year end 
the percentage of classified loans to total risk based capital is now just under 
the decline was a result of improved work out strategies undertaken by the bank 
significant focus on underwriting  and a portfolio risk approach should allow the bank to manage credit risk effectively 
our net interest margin  which was in  will continue to be impacted by actions of the federal reserve 
the federal reserve raised the federal funds target rate four times in basis point increments during the first six months of  and then held the rate at for the balance of the year 
the us treasury yield curve remained relatively flat throughout the entire year  which created issues for most financial institutions 
our projections for are based on the federal reserve leaving short term interest rates unchanged for the remainder of the year 
our interest bearing liabilities re price to current market conditions faster than our interest earning assets 
most of the variable rate mortgage loans in our portfolio lag the market days when they are scheduled to re price 
a stabilized short term interest rate environment in the second half of would provide interest earning assets an opportunity to catch up  leading to an expected improvement in the net interest margin 
we also expect an improvement in the mix of interest earning assets in that may further improve the net interest margin 
the proceeds from the november sale of million in low yielding us government agency securities was used primarily to pay off borrowings from the federal home loan bank  which had increased to million at october  future cash flows from maturing securities will be used to pay down short term borrowings and fund new loan volume 
the steady redeployment of cash flows from the investment portfolio into higher yielding assets should improve the net interest margin 
as part of the corporate plan  the company s short and long term action plans include recruiting seasoned commercial lenders  credit analysts and key risk managers 
diversifying the loan portfolio by reducing the concentration in commercial real estate and expanding commercial  residential real estate and consumer lending 
focusing on retail banking activities including emphasizing transactional deposit growth  expanding customer relationships as measured by products per household and acquisition of new customer relationships 
reducing the operating expenses of the company 
reducing the size of the investment portfolio as a percent of total assets

critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company are maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in detail in the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions  and such estimates and assumptions are integral to the understanding of reported results 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and they require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses provides coverage for probable losses in the company s loan portfolio 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses each quarter based on changes  if any  in underwriting activities  the loan portfolio composition including product mix and geographic  industry or customer specific concentrations  trends in loan performance  regulatory guidance and economic factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires the use of significant management estimates 
many factors can affect management s estimates of specific and expected losses  including volatility of default probabilities  rating migrations  loss severity and economic and political conditions 
the allowance is increased through provisions charged to operating earnings and reduced by net charge offs 
the company determines the amount of the allowance based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
the allowance recorded for commercial loans is based on reviews of individual credit relationships and an analysis of the migration of commercial loans and actual loss experience 
the allowance recorded for non commercial loans is based on an analysis of loan mix  risk characteristics of the portfolio  fraud loss and bankruptcy experiences and historical losses  adjusted for current trends  for each loan category or group of loans 
the allowance for loan losses relating to impaired loans is based on the loan s observable market price  the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans  or the discounted cash flows using the loan s effective interest rate 
regardless of the extent of the company s analysis of customer performance  portfolio trends or risk management processes  certain inherent but undetected losses are probable within the loan and lease portfolio 
this is due to several factors  including inherent delays in obtaining information regarding a customer s financial condition or changes in their unique business conditions  the judgmental nature of individual loan evaluations  collateral assessments and the interpretation of economic trends 
volatility of economic or customer specific conditions affecting the identification and estimation of losses for larger  non homogeneous credits and the sensitivity of assumptions utilized to establish allowances for homogenous groups of loans are among other factors 
the company estimates a range of inherent losses related to the existence of these exposures 
the estimates are based upon the company s evaluation of risk associated with the commercial and consumer allowance levels and the estimated impact of the current economic environment 
mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights msrs associated with loans originated and sold  where servicing is retained  are capitalized and included in other intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
the value of the capitalized servicing rights represents the present value of the future servicing fees arising from the right to service loans in the portfolio 
critical accounting policies for msrs relate to the initial valuation and subsequent impairment tests 
the methodology used to determine the valuation of msrs requires the development and use of a number of estimates  including anticipated principal amortization and prepayments of that principal balance 
events that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest rates  mortgage loan prepayment speeds and the payment performance of the underlying loans 
the carrying value of the msrs is periodically reviewed for impairment based on a determination of fair value 
impairment  if any  is recognized through a valuation allowance and is recorded as amortization of intangible assets 
financial condition total assets decreased million or to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was primarily due to the strategy employed by management in november to sell low yielding us government agency securities and use the proceeds mostly to pay down borrowed money 
cash and cash equivalents total cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at december  from million at december  cash on hand and in other institutions decreased  or  to million at december  interest bearing deposits decreased million  or  to million at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to the reduction of interest bearing demand deposits  as those funds were needed to fund loan growth 
securities investment securities decreased million to million at december   from million at december   primarily as a result of the strategy employed in november that involved the sale of million in low yielding securities  offset by an increase in municipal securities  which may provide the company with additional tax benefits 
investments held to maturity were all reclassified as available for sale in the third quarter of  which resulted in a million reduction of investments held to maturity and a million increase in investments available for sale at december  this reclassification provided us with more flexibility to address changes in interest rate risk or capitalize on opportunities to generate higher interest earnings 
the change had no effect on our earnings but did reduce shareholders equity due to the recording of unrealized net losses in other comprehensive income 
all of our investments are evaluated for other than temporary impairment  and such impairment  if any  is recognized as a charge to earnings

loans net loans receivable totaled  at december   an increase of million  or  from million at december  the increase was primarily due to increased commercial loans  a strategy to retain fixed rate mortgage loans in portfolio  and lease purchases 
residential loans increased million to million at december   from million at december  the increase was due to purchasing million in fixed rate mortgage loans and retaining fixed rate mortgage loans in portfolio 
we generally retain loan servicing on loans sold 
loans we serviced for investors  primarily freddie mac  fannie mae and the fhlb  totaled approximately million at december  compared to million at december  loans sold and that we subsequently service generate a steady source of fee income  with servicing fees ranging from to 
construction loans increased million to million at december  from million at december  the increase was primarily due to the origination of commercial construction loans 
commercial and industrial loans increased million to million at december  from million at december  the increase was due to increased penetration by our lenders in the local market areas 
consumer loans increased million to million at december  from million at december  new loan production was million in compared to million in residential loan production increased to million in from million in originations decreased but were supplemented by the purchase of fixed rate mortgage pools 
commercial real estate and construction loan production decreased to million in from million in credit quality non performing loans increased  to million at december  from million at december  the increase was primarily related to one residential construction loan and a judgment purchased as part of a work out strategy on a multi family complex 
we recorded net charge offs of  in and net recoveries of million in loan charge offs were  in and million in  while recoveries were  and million in the same periods 
the allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans was at december  and at december  the decrease reflects amounts charged off related to a sale of two classified loans 
cash value of life insurance we have investments in life insurance on employees and directors  with a balance or cash surrender value of million and million  respectively  at december  and the majority of these policies were purchased in the nontaxable increase in cash surrender value of life insurance was  in  compared to  in deposits the following table shows deposit changes by category dollars in thousands change change december  noninterest bearing accounts savings deposits now and super now accounts money market accounts certificates  and more other certificates totals non maturity deposits decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december   reflecting customers preference for fixed rate deposit accounts 
money market account balances increased as a result of a rate promotion in selected markets of the bank 
certificates of deposit decreased million due to the maturity of a million brokered certificate issued by the bank in borrowings borrowings increased million to million at december  from million at december  at december   our borrowings consisted of fhlb advances totaling million and subordinated debentures in the amount of million 
the subordinated debentures were issued on march   and mature on march  a note payable in the amount of  outstanding at december   was paid off in interest rate risk interest rate risk irr is the risk to earnings and capital arising from movements in interest rates 
irr can result from timing differences in the maturity repricing of an institution s assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts  the effect of embedded options  such as call or convertible options  loan prepayments  interest rate caps  and deposit withdrawals  unexpected shifts of the yield curve that affect both the slope and shape of the yield curve and  differences in the behavior of lending and funding rates  sometimes referred to as basis risk 
an example would occur if floating rate assets and liabilities  with otherwise identical repricing characteristics  were based on market indexes that were imperfectly correlated 
the asset liability committee and the board of directors review our exposure to interest rate changes and market risk quarterly 
this review is accomplished by the use of a cash flow simulation model using detailed securities  loan  deposit  borrowings and market information to estimate fair values of assets and liabilities using discounted cash flows 
we monitor irr from two perspectives economic value at risk long term exposure the difference between the bank s estimated fair value of assets and the estimated fair value of liabilities is the fair value of equity  also referred to as net present value of equity npv 
the change in the npv is calculated at different interest rate intervals 
this measures our irr exposure from movements in interest rates and the resulting change in the npv 
earnings at risk near term exposure the model also tests the impact various interest rate scenarios have on net interest income over a stated period of time one year  for example 
we recognize that effective management of irr includes an understanding of when potential adverse changes in interest rates will flow through the profit and loss statement 
accordingly  we will manage our position so that exposure to net interest income is monitored over both a one year planning horizon accounting perspective and a longer term strategic horizon economic perspective 
our objective is to manage our exposure to interest rate risk  bearing in mind that we will always be in the business of taking on rate risk and that rate risk immunization is not possible 
also  it is recognized that as exposure to interest rate risk is reduced  so too may the net interest margin be reduced 
change in irr calculation we changed our emphasis on what we monitor for irr in the npv method was our primary irr measurement in the past 
the npv method uses a liquidation model by simulating a mark to market of the entire balance sheet 
the liquidation model identifies mismatched risk both for the near term and long term 
our primary concern going forward is our irr exposure in the near term by focusing on earnings at risk 
we also changed to a different modeling program which uses similar methodologies and assumptions as the previous model 
the primary difference between the two models is the reinvestment of cash flows 
the old model assumed cash flows were reinvested in the same type of financial instrument where the new model directs cash flows to specific loan types  primarily hybrid adjustable rate mortgages and commercial loans 
position assessment as of december  total loans increased million to million at december  loan demand centered on commercial construction  hybrid residential adjustable rate mortgages  and home equity lines of credit draws 
balance sheet spreads remained under pressure for most of with funding costs increasing at a pace faster than asset yields 
during the fourth quarter  we restructured the investment portfolio  selling million of securities and using some of the proceeds to reduce fhlb advances 
as a result  the net balance sheet spread increased basis points bp during the fourth quarter 
changes in replacement assumptions  higher expected replacement rates on loans and in the rates and terms of fhlb advances  the net interest income simulations show higher levels of income in the first year of all scenarios reviewed 
the balance sheet is structurally asset sensitive over the long term with a slight asset bias in the first years 
all potential exposures remain within policy limits 
interest rate scenarios base case projected net interest income in first year assuming current rates remain unchanged 
nii is projected to gradually increase over the simulation period as existing asset cash flows are assumed to be replaced with higher yielding products 
the continued  upward repricing replacement of loan products at today s higher rate levels enable asset yields to stay ahead of funding cost increases 
should the bank not be able to replace assets at the rates modeled  or deposit rates need to be increased more than assumed to retain balances  nii will be materially lower than projected 
falling rates bp projected net interest income declines in first year and increases in second year when compared to base case scenario 
nii is initially projected to trend slightly below the results shown in the base scenario  as the large short term funding base reflects the rate reductions faster than the asset base 
beyond the first year  pressure on nii is exacerbated as accelerated cash flow from mortgage based assets continues to be reinvested at lower rates  driving asset yields lower while funding costs reach their floors 
should the yield curve steepen as rates fall  potential nii exposure may be eliminated 
rising rates bp projected net interest income increases in first year and increases in second year when compared to base case scenario 
should rates continue to rise  nii levels are expected to trend with current rate scenario over the first years of the simulation period  with income climbing steadily throughout the remaining modeled timeframe 
funding cost increases related to the short term time deposit portfolio are mitigated by increasing asset yields 
late in the second year  the repricing replacement of assets gains momentum and begins to offset funding cost pressures 
thereafter  the asset sensitive balance sheet asserts itself and asset yields continue to improve while funding costs stabilize  widening balance sheet margin and increasing nii

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses represents the current period credit or cost associated with maintaining an appropriate allowance for loan losses 
periodic fluctuations in the provision for loan losses result from management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is dependent upon many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  assessment by management  third parties and banking regulators of the quality of the loan portfolio  the value of the underlying collateral on problem loans and the general economic conditions in our market areas 
we believe the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

provision for loan losses we had a provision adjustment of million for compared to a provision of  in the provision adjustment reflected total recoveries of million primarily due to recoveries on the leases 
we recorded net recoveries of million in and net charge offs of million in other income the increase in other income in as compared to resulted primarily from increases in other fees and service charges  and other income  which was partially offset by decreases in gain on sale of loans and servicing rights  brokerage and insurance commissions  and increase on cash surrender value of life insurance 
the increase in other fees and service charges was primarily due to an increase in deposit service charge fees mainly from the overdraft honors program  which began in late the increase in other income was mainly from a  gain on sale of land we owned which was adjacent to our branch lot in greenfield  indiana and which was not needed for expansion purposes 
the decrease in gain on sale of loans and servicing rights was due to a decline in mortgage loans sold during the period 
loans originated for sale were million in compared to million in although residential mortgage loan production was comparable in and  we retained a greater portion of our loans in because we originated more adjustable rate loans 
we sold most of our fixed rate mortgage loan production in however  in  we retained most of the fifteen year fixed rate mortgage loans we produced 
fifteen year fixed rate mortgage loans generally pose lower interest rate risk than thirty year fixed rate mortgage loans because of their shorter average life 
the decrease in brokerage and insurance commissions was mainly due to a decline in sales because of an extended medical leave by one of our two brokers in the decline in increase on cash surrender value of life insurance was due to lower investment rates 
other expense the increase in other expense in as compared to resulted primarily from increases in salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expense  legal and professional fees  advertising and marketing  and other expenses  which was partially offset by decreases in printing and office supplies and data processing expense 
the increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to an increase in pension expense offset by a reduction in salary expense 
in addition to the increase in pension expense  we also incurred an additional  in health insurance premiums to reimburse our health insurance provider for claims in past plan years that were in excess of the annual cap 
the decline in salary expense was due to reduced staffing levels as a result of improved efficiencies 
the increase in occupancy and equipment expense was primarily due to increased depreciation expense related to our mccordsville branch that opened in other occupancy expense categories that contributed to the increase included utilities and repairs and maintenance 
the increase in legal and professional fees was due to consulting fees paid to profit resources for a consulting engagement to improve operational efficiencies and recruiting fees for the chief executive officer  chief lending officer and a commercial loan officer 
the increase in advertising and marketing expense was due to an increase in loan promotions which led to higher advertising and direct mail costs 
the increase in other expenses was in part due to a large donation of  to the city of anderson  indiana for its downtown revitalization project 
the donation was part of an agreement between the city and a group of banks  including us  where the city paid off loans secured by commercial buildings in downtown anderson 
the decrease in printing and office supplies and data processing expenses were due to general expense reductions mainly due to improved operating efficiencies 
income tax expense the increase in income taxes in as compared to resulted primarily from higher net operating earnings and a valuation allowance against our current period state income taxes 
we recorded an income tax expense of  in  compared to an income tax benefit of  in we have a deferred state tax asset that is primarily the result of operating losses sustained since for state tax purposes 
we started recording a valuation allowance against our current period state income tax benefit in due to our concern that we may not be able to use more than the tax asset already recorded on the books without modifying the use of aimi  our investment subsidiary

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet current and future obligations of a short term nature 
historically  funds provided by operations  loan repayments and new deposits have been our principal sources of liquid funds 
in addition  we have the ability to obtain funds through the sale of new mortgage loans  through borrowings from the fhlb system  and through the brokered certificates market 
we regularly adjust the investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities and the objectives of our asset liability program 
at december   we had million in loan commitments outstanding and million of additional commitments for line of credit receivables 
retail certificates of deposit due within one year of december  totaled million  or of total deposits 
if these maturing certificates of deposit do not remain with us  other sources of funds must be used  including other certificates of deposit  brokered cds  and borrowings
