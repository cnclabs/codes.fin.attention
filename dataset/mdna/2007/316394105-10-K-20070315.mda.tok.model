item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
our continued pace of growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed 
we are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
we anticipate our capital resources will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we may at some point  however  need to raise additional capital to support our continued growth 
if we raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other securities  it would dilute the ownership interest of our current shareholders and may dilute the per share book value of our common stock 
new investors may also have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our current shareholders  which may adversely impact our current shareholders 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside our control  and on our financial performance 
accordingly  we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth or acquisitions could be materially impaired 
the building of market share through our branching strategy could cause our expenses to increase faster than revenues 
we intend to continue to build market share in the greater atlanta metropolitan area through our branching strategy 
we are planning two new branches that we intend to open during the second or third 
table of contents quarter of there are additional branch locations under consideration 
there are considerable costs involved in opening branches and new branches generally require a period of time to generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs  especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence 
accordingly  any new branch can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until the branch reaches certain economies of scale 
our expenses could be further increased if we encounter delays in the opening of any of our new branches 
finally  we have no assurance that our new branches will be successful  even after they have been established 
our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks 
from time to time  we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business 
there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts  particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed 
in developing and marketing new lines of business and or new products and services  we may invest significant time and resources 
initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible 
external factors  such as compliance with regulations  competitive alternatives  and shifting market preferences  may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service 
furthermore  any new line of business and or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls 
failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain key people 
competition for the best people in most activities that we engage in can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills  knowledge of our market  years of industry experience  and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel 
we currently have employment agreements and non compete agreements with certain of our senior officers 
our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan  and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we may be unable to keep pace with technological change 
the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change  with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we are subject to claims and litigation 
from time to time  customers and others make claims and take legal action pertaining to the company s performance of our responsibilities 
whether customer claims and legal action related to the company s performance of our responsibilities are founded or unfounded  or if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the company  they may result in significant financial liability and or adversely affect the market perception of the company and our products and services  as well as impact customer demand for those products and services 
any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on our business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to our common stock our stock price can be volatile 
stock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive 
our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including  among other things actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations  recommendations by securities analysts  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us  news reports relating to trends  concerns and other issues in the financial services industry  perceptions in the marketplace regarding the company and or our competitors  new technology used  or services offered  by competitors  significant acquisitions or business combinations  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving the company or our competitors  failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions  changes in government laws and regulation  and geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts 
general market fluctuations  industry factors  and general economic and political conditions and events  such as economic slowdowns or recessions  interest rate changes or credit loss trends  could also cause our stock price to decrease  regardless of operating results 
our common stock trading volume is less than that of other larger financial services companies 
although our common stock is listed for trading on nasdaq  the trading volume in our common stock is less than that of larger financial services companies 
a public trading market having the desired 
table of contents characteristics of depth  liquidity  and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time 
this presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control 
given the lower trading volume of our common stock  significant sales of our common stock  or the expectation of these sales  could cause our stock price to fall 
an investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit 
our common stock is not a bank deposit and  therefore  is not insured against loss by the fdic  any other deposit insurance fund  or by any other public or private entity 
investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this risk factors section and elsewhere in this report 
as a result  if you acquire our common stock  you may lose some or all of your investment 
risks associated with our industry the earnings of financial services companies are significantly affected by general business and economic conditions 
our operations and profitability are impacted by general business and economic conditions in the united states and abroad 
these conditions include short term and long term interest rates  inflation  money supply  political issues  legislative and regulatory changes  fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets  broad trends in industry and finance  and the strength of the us economy and the local economies in which we operate  all of which are beyond our control 
a deterioration in economic conditions could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and non performing assets  decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for our products and services  among other things  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
financial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties 
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions  we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties  including financial statements  credit reports  and other financial information 
we may also rely on representations of those customers  counterparties or other third parties  such as independent auditors  as to the accuracy and completeness of that information 
reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements  credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated financial review the following management discussion and analysis addresses important factors affecting the results of operations and financial condition of fsc and its subsidiaries for the periods indicated 
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with this review 
business overview fsc is a bank holding company headquartered in atlanta  georgia  and is the parent company of its wholly owned subsidiaries  fidelity bank the bank  lionmark insurance company lic  and four subsidiaries formed to issue trust preferred securities

sba lending is conducted throughout the southeast 
lic provides a credit related insurance product to the bank s indirect automobile customers through our atlanta  georgia  office 
our profitability  as with most financial institutions  is significantly dependent upon net interest income  which is the difference between interest received on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses  noninterest income  such as service charges on deposit accounts and fees on other services  income from indirect and sba lending activities  mortgage banking  brokerage activities  and bank owned life insurance  as well as noninterest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  furniture and equipment  professional and other services  and other expenses  including income taxes 
economic conditions  competition  and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government significantly affect financial institutions 
beginning in and continuing until june  the federal government s monetary and fiscal policy was marked by a steady pattern of increases to short term interest rates 
our lending activities are also significantly influenced by the local economic environments in atlanta  georgia  and jacksonville  florida  including the demand for and supply of commercial and residential properties  competition among lenders  interest rate conditions  and prevailing rates for competing investments and deposit products in these primary market areas 
our focus is on building value 
our mission is to continue growth  improve earnings and increase shareholder value  to treat customers  employees  community and shareholders according to the golden rule  and to operate within a culture of strong internal controls 
fidelity bank is atlanta s community bank 
we are about building relationships with a locally oriented  community based focus 
the bank provides a broad array of sophisticated products delivered with quality personal service 

table of contents the bank s franchise spans six counties in the metropolitan atlanta market 
atlanta s economy appears to be generally sound and growing based on economic trends  and we are optimistic regarding growth and profitability opportunities for  although we anticipate some moderation in our rate of loan growth during early  primarily related to a slowdown in residential real estate construction activity 
strategic initiatives completed over the past few years were designed to position ourselves to focus on the core banking business while expanding product offerings  reducing product delivery risk  reducing product credit risk  growing noninterest income  improving profitability  and strengthening capital 
although managing the net interest margin was a challenge in  we continued to have well balanced substantial loan and deposit growth 
in addition  during  we grew shareholder value by growing the core bank and maintaining profits  while focusing on the future by implementing and continuing certain initiatives that are anticipated to contribute to our longer term value through increasing the bank s transaction deposit base and increasing noninterest income 
we define our core banking business as that of providing quality financial products  services  and delivery systems at the community banking level to both consumers and small to medium sized businesses 
we continued our initiative to grow shareholder value by increasing personal and business transaction accounts to expand current customer relationships  add new customers  and increase the number and volume of lower cost transaction account deposits 
in  we strengthened our retail banking staff  opened two new branches in sugarloaf and conyers and continued market studies to identify several other potential branch sites 
we have plans for two more branches in the second or third quarter of our totally free business and personal checking account program was launched in january  with a full array of new  simplified deposit products 
in part  as a result of this initiative  transaction accounts increased at december  compared to december  and the average balance of transaction accounts increased by approximately for the same period 
also  the accelerated hiring of lenders  particularly in sba  commercial  and indirect automobile lending  continued throughout the expansion of these areas is now in balance with revenues and profits projected for  although as strategic opportunities present themselves  they will be carefully weighed in regard to current resource allocation versus longer term shareholder value 
our focus for is on balancing growth  expenses  and capital with improved earnings 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and conform to general practices within the financial services industry 
our financial position and results of operations are affected by management s application of accounting policies  including estimates  assumptions  and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
different assumptions in the application of these policies  or conditions significantly different from certain assumptions  could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
the more critical accounting and reporting policies include those related to the allowance for loan losses  the capitalization of excess servicing assets and their amortization  loan related revenue recognition  and income taxes 
our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
significant accounting policies have been periodically discussed and reviewed with and approved by the audit committee of the board of directors and the board of directors 

table of contents the following is a summary of our significant accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through provisions charged to operations 
such provisions are based on management s evaluation of the loan portfolio  including loan portfolio concentrations  current economic conditions  the economic outlook  past loan loss experience  adequacy of underlying collateral  and such other factors which  in management s judgment  deserve consideration in estimating loan losses 
loans are charged off when  in the opinion of management  such loans are deemed to be uncollectible 
subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance 
a formal review of the allowance for loan losses is prepared at least quarterly to assess the probable credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio  including concentrations  and to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
for purposes of the quarterly management review  the consumer loan portfolio is separated by loan type and each loan type is treated as a homogeneous pool 
in accordance with the interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses  the level of allowance required for each loan type is determined based upon current trends in charge off rates for each loan type  adjusted for changes in these pools  which includes current information on the payment performance of each loan type 
the level of allowance required for each loan type is determined in part based upon historical charge off experience 
every commercial  commercial real estate  sba  and construction loan is assigned a risk rating using established credit policy guidelines 
a loss allocation factor is determined for each significant loan category based on historical charge off experience  current trends  the economic outlook  and other factors 
all nonperforming commercial  commercial real estate  sba  and construction loans  and loans deemed to have greater than normal risk characteristics are reviewed monthly by credit review to determine the level of additional allocation for loan losses required to be specifically assigned to these loans 
the amounts so determined are then added to or subtracted from the previously allocated allowance by category to determine the required allowance for commercial  commercial real estate  sba  residential real estate  consumer  and construction loans 
capitalized servicing assets and liabilities indirect automobile loan pools and certain sba loans are sold with servicing retained 
when the contractually specific servicing fees on loans sold servicing retained exceed the estimated costs to service those loans  a capitalized servicing asset is recognized 
when the estimated costs to service loans exceed the contractually specific servicing fees on loans sold servicing retained  a capitalized servicing liability is recognized 
servicing assets and servicing liabilities are amortized over the expected lives of the serviced loans utilizing the interest method 
management makes certain estimates and assumptions related to costs to service varying types of loans and pools of loans  the projected lives of loans and pools of loans sold servicing retained  and discount factors used in calculating the present values of servicing fees projected to be received 
no less frequently than quarterly  management reviews the status of all loans and pools of loans sold with related capitalized servicing assets to determine if there is any impairment to those assets due to such factors as earlier than estimated repayments or significant prepayments 
any impairment identified in these assets will result in reductions in their carrying values and a corresponding reduction in operating revenues 
loan related revenue recognition loans are reported at principal amounts outstanding net of deferred fees and costs 
interest income and ancillary fees from loans are a primary source of revenue 
interest income is recognized in a manner that results 
table of contents in a level yield on principal amounts outstanding 
rate related loan fee income  loan origination  and commitment fees  and certain direct origination costs are deferred and amortized as an adjustment of the yield over the contractual lives of the related loans  taking into consideration assumed prepayments 
the accrual of interest is discontinued when  in management s judgment  it is determined that the collectibility of interest or principal is doubtful 
for commercial  sba  construction  and real estate loans  the accrual of interest is discontinued and the loan categorized as nonaccrual when  in management s opinion  due to deterioration in the financial position or operations of the borrower  the full repayment of principal and interest is not expected  or principal or interest has been in default for a period of days or more  unless the obligation is both well secured and in the process of collection 
commercial  sba  construction  and real estate secured loans may be returned to accrual status when management expects to collect all principal and interest and the loan has been brought current 
interest received on well collateralized nonaccrual loans is recognized on the cash basis 
if the commercial  sba  construction or real estate secured loan is not well collateralized  payments are applied to reduce principal 
consumer loans are placed on nonaccrual upon becoming days past due or sooner if  in the opinion of management  the full repayment of principal and interest is not expected 
on consumer loans  any payment received on a loan on which the accrual of interest has been suspended is applied to reduce principal 
when a well collateralized commercial  sba  construction  or real estate secured loan is placed on nonaccrual  accrued interest is not reversed and future payments of interest are recognized as interest income when received 
for other loans  interest accrued during the current accounting period is reversed and interest accrued in prior periods  if significant  is charged off and adjustments to principal are made if the collateral related to the loan is deficient 
income taxes we file consolidated federal income tax returns  as well as tax returns in several states 
income taxes are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under the liability method of sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled 
deferred tax assets are reviewed annually to assess the probability of realization of benefits in future periods or whether valuation allowances are appropriate 
under sfas no 
 the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the calculation of the income tax provision is complex and requires the use of judgments and estimates in its determination 
off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers  and to reduce our own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
these financial instruments  which include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit  involve to varying degrees elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
the contract or notional amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments 

table of contents our exposure to credit loss  in the event of nonperformance by customers for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit  is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for recorded loans 
loan commitments and other off balance sheet exposures are evaluated by credit review quarterly and reserves are provided for risk as deemed appropriate 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the agreement 
substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding 
we minimize our exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures 
thus  we will deny funding a commitment if the borrower s financial condition deteriorates during the commitment period  such that the customer no longer meets the pre established conditions of lending 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
we evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower 
collateral held varies  but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
standby and import letters of credit are commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans or lines of credit to customers 
we hold collateral supporting those commitments as deemed necessary 
financial overview since our inception  we have pursued managed profitable growth  primarily through internal expansion built on providing quality financial services in selected market areas 
during  we experienced significant and well balanced loan and deposit growth 
all loan production areas  except mortgage lending  achieved substantial production as a result of strong demand 
the loan portfolio is well diversified among consumer  business  and real estate  and credit quality remains strong 
the hiring of lenders  particularly for sba and indirect automobile lending  continued throughout and we believe these areas are now in line with our currently projected revenues and profits 
our hiring  marketing and branch expansion initiatives implemented near the end of and continuing into have been successful as reflected in our strong loan and deposit growth  improving deposit mix and improvement in both net interest income and noninterest income 
net income for was million compared to the million earned in net income per diluted share was for and key factors impacting our financial condition and results of operations for are summarized below total assets increased million or to  million at the end of compared to  million at year end this increase was primarily due to the increase in total loans  partially offset by decreases in federal funds sold and investment securities 
transaction accounts increased through our deposit acquisition program 
net interest income increased million or over to million as the growth in volume exceeded the negative impact of a declining net interest margin and resulted in greater net interest income 
the net interest margin declined seven basis points in to from in resulting from a basis point increase in the cost of funds outpacing the basis point increase in the yield on earning assets

results of operations compared to net income our net income for the year ended december   was million or basic and fully diluted earnings per share  respectively 
net income for the year ended december   was million or basic and fully diluted earnings per share 
the  increase in net income in compared to was largely attributable to increases in net interest income and noninterest income  offset in large part by the planned advertising and promotion costs associated with our transaction acquisition program which began in january and other increases in costs primarily driven by our strategic plan  which included accelerating our focus on strengthening our sales force and culture to increase both quality loan production and transaction deposit growth 
net interest income increased during compared to as the growth in volume exceeded the negative impact of a declining net interest margin and resulted in greater net interest income 
the average balance of interest earning assets increased million  resulting in an increase in interest income  offset in part by a seven basis point decline in the net interest margin

average interest earning assets in grew in all loan categories  as average loan balances grew million 
offsetting this growth was a million decrease in average investment securities balances  as principal payments on mortgage backed securities were utilized to fund higher yielding loan growth 
the basis point increase in the yield on interest earning assets resulted primarily from increases in market rates of interest 

table of contents interest expense in increased million or to million as a result of a million or growth in average interest bearing liability balances  coupled with a basis point increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities due to increasing prevailing interest rates  and aggressive competition for funds from other financial institutions as the bank grew deposits to fund significant loan growth 
average total interest bearing deposits increased million or to  million during compared to  while average borrowings increased million or to million 
the increase in average total interest bearing deposits was primarily due to advertised premium yield programs initiated to provide funding for loan growth  including special deposit programs offered as part of the grand openings of the new sugarloaf and conyers branches and a direct mail advertising program to increase transaction account balances and increase the total balances of multiple relationship customers

the growth in average interest earning assets in was driven primarily by growth in all loan categories except loans held for sale  as average loan balances grew million  offset in part by a decrease in average investment securities balances  which declined million  as principal payments on mortgage backed securities were utilized to fund higher yielding loan growth 
the increase in the yield on interest earning assets was due to increases in yields on all loan portfolios and the decrease in average balances in lower yielding investment securities 
a basis point increase in yields on average loan balances was in large part attributable to a steadily increasing short term interest rate environment during the second half of and throughout the million or increase in interest expense was attributable to a million growth in average interest bearing liability balances  exacerbated by a basis point increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities due to increasing market rates of interest and increasing competition for deposits

each of these negatively impacted our fourth quarter loan production compared to prior quarters  although fourth quarter loan production exceeded that for the same period in as a result of decreased indirect automobile loans sold with servicing retained and less gain on sales as production was sold into a rising interest rate market  offset in part by higher revenues from an increased balance of indirect automobile loans serviced providing servicing and ancillary fees  revenue from indirect loan activities for totaled million compared to million in  a decrease of  or 
service charges on deposit accounts declined approximately  or to million in compared to million in  primarily due to continuing competitive pressures to reduce fees and charges  because of an improving economy and modified customer behaviors  resulting in fewer insufficient funds charges and other charges  and higher market rates of interest  resulting in greater earnings credits offsetting activity changes on certain business checking accounts

to accomplish this objective  management strives for efficient management of interest rate risk and liquidity needs 
the primary objectives of interest sensitivity management are to minimize the effect of interest rate changes on the net interest margin and to manage the exposure to risk while maintaining net interest income at acceptable levels 
liquidity is provided by carefully structuring the balance sheet and through unsecured and secured lines of credit with other financial institutions  the federal home loan bank of atlanta the fhlb  and the federal reserve bank of atlanta the frb 
the asset liability management committee alco meets regularly to  among other things  review our interest rate sensitivity positions and our balance sheet mix  review our product offerings and pricing  including rates  fees and charges  monitor our funding needs and sources  and assess our current and projected liquidity 
market risk our primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk and credit risk and  to a lesser extent  liquidity risk 
we have little or no risk related to trading accounts  commodities  or foreign exchange 
interest rate risk  which encompasses price risk  is the exposure of a banking organization s financial condition and earnings ability to withstand adverse movements in interest rates 
accepting this risk can be an important source of profitability and shareholder value  however  excessive levels of interest rate risk can pose a significant threat to assets  earnings  and capital 
accordingly  effective risk management that maintains interest rate risk at prudent levels is essential to our success 
alco  which includes senior management representatives  monitors and considers methods of managing the rate and sensitivity repricing characteristics of the balance sheet components consistent with maintaining acceptable levels of changes in portfolio values and net interest income with changes in interest rates 
the primary purposes of alco are to manage our interest rate risk consistent with earnings and liquidity  to effectively invest our capital  and to preserve the value created by our core business operations 
our exposure to interest rate risk compared to established tolerances is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis by our board of directors 

table of contents evaluating a financial institution s exposure to changes in interest rates includes assessing both the adequacy of the management process used to control interest rate risk and the organization s quantitative levels of exposure 
when assessing the interest rate risk management process  we seek to ensure that appropriate policies  procedures  management information systems  and internal controls are in place to maintain interest rate risk at prudent levels with consistency and continuity 
evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk exposure requires us to assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on our consolidated financial condition  including capital adequacy  earnings  liquidity  and  where appropriate  asset quality 
the federal reserve  together with the fdic and other regulatory agencies  adopted a joint agency policy statement on interest rate risk  effective june  the policy statement  focusing primarily on the impact of changes in economic value or net present value equity at risk as a result of interest rate changes  provides guidance to examiners and bankers on sound practices for managing interest rate risk  which provides a basis for ongoing evaluation of the adequacy of interest rate risk management at supervised institutions 
the policy statement also outlines fundamental elements of sound management that have been identified in prior federal reserve guidance and discusses the importance of these elements in the context of managing interest rate risk 
interest rate sensitivity analysis is used to measure our interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in earnings and in the net present value of our cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
net present value represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items 
this analysis assesses the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates equity at risk 
we utilize a statistical research firm specializing in the banking industry to provide various quarterly analyses and special analyses  as requested  related to our current and projected financial performance  including rate shock analyses 
data sources for this and other analyses include quarterly fdic call reports and the federal reserve y c  management assumptions  industry norms and financial markets data 
for purposes of evaluating rate shock  rate change induced sensitivity tables are used in determining the timing and volume of repayment  prepayment  and early withdrawals 
earnings and fair value estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and  therefore  cannot be determined with precision 
assumptions have been made as to appropriate discount rates  prepayment speeds  expected cash flows  and other variables 
changes in assumptions significantly affect the estimates and  as such  the derived earnings and fair value may not be indicative of the negotiable value in an actual sale or comparable to that reported by other financial institutions 
in addition  the fair value estimates are based on existing financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business 
the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates 
our policy states that a negative change in net present value equity at risk as a result of an immediate and sustained basis point increase or decrease in interest rates should not exceed the lesser of of total assets or of total regulatory capital 
it also states that a similar increase or decrease in interest rates should not negatively impact net interest income or net income by more than or  respectively 
the following schedule reflects an analysis of our assumed market value risk and earnings risk inherent in our interest rate sensitive instruments related to immediate and sustained interest rate variances of basis points  both above and below current levels rate shock analysis 
it also reflects the estimated effects on net interest income and net income over a one year period and the estimated effects on net present value of our 
table of contents assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet items as a result of an immediate and sustained increase or decrease of basis points in market rates of interest as of december  and dollars in thousands rate shock analysis december  december  basis basis basis basis market rates of interest points points points points change in net present value change as a percent of total assets change as a percent of regulatory equity percent change in net interest income percent change in net income the rate shock analysis at december   indicated that the effects of an immediate and sustained increase or decrease of basis points in market rates of interest would fall well within policy parameters and approved tolerances for equity at risk  net interest income and net income 
we have historically been asset sensitive to six months  however  we have been liability sensitive from six months to one year  largely mitigating the potential negative impact on net interest income and net income over a full year from a sudden and sustained decrease in interest rates 
likewise  historically the potential positive impact on net interest income and net income of a sudden and sustained increase in interest rates is reduced over a one year period as a result of our liability sensitivity in the six month to one year time frame 
as discussed  the negative impact of an immediate and sustained basis point increase in market rates of interest on the net present value equity at risk was well within established tolerances at december   and was significantly less than that at december   primarily because of the reduced sensitivity in our transactional deposits 
also  the negative impact of an immediate and sustained basis point decrease in market rates of interest on net interest income and net income was well within established tolerances and reflected a decrease in interest rate sensitivity at december   compared to year end we follow fdic guidelines for non maturity deposits such as interest bearing transaction and savings accounts in the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis  therefore  this analysis does not reflect the full impact of rapidly rising or falling market rates of interest on these accounts compared to the results of the rate shock analysis presented 
rate shock analysis provides only a limited  point in time view of interest rate sensitivity 
the gap analysis also does not reflect factors such as the magnitude versus the timing of future interest rate changes and asset prepayments 
the actual impact of interest rate changes upon earnings and net present value may differ from that implied by any static rate shock or gap measurement 
in addition  net interest income and net present value under various future interest rate scenarios are affected by multiple other factors not embodied in a static rate shock or gap analysis  including competition  changes in the shape of the treasury yield curve  divergent movement among various interest rate indices  and the speed with which interest rates change 
interest rate sensitivity the major elements used to manage interest rate risk include the mix of fixed and variable rate assets and liabilities and the maturity and repricing patterns of these assets and liabilities 
it is our policy not to invest in derivatives 
we perform a quarterly review of assets and liabilities that reprice and the time bands within which the repricing occurs 
balances generally are reported in the time band that corresponds to the instrument s next repricing date or contractual maturity  whichever occurs first 
however  fixed rate indirect automobile loans  mortgage backed securities  and residential mortgage loans are primarily included based on scheduled payments with a prepayment factor incorporated 
through such analyses  we monitor and manage our interest sensitivity gap to minimize the negative effects of changing interest rates 

table of contents the interest rate sensitivity structure within our balance sheet at december   indicated a cumulative net interest sensitivity liability gap of when projecting out one year 
in the near term  defined as days  there was a cumulative net interest sensitivity asset gap of at december  when projecting forward six months  there was a net interest sensitivity liability gap of 
this information represents a general indication of repricing characteristics over time  however  the sensitivity of certain deposit products may vary during extreme swings in the interest rate cycle see market risk 
since all interest rates and yields do not adjust at the same velocity  the interest rate sensitivity gap is only a general indicator of the potential effects of interest rate changes on net interest income 
our policy states that the cumulative gap at six months and one year should generally not exceed and  respectively 
our cumulative gap at one year slightly exceeds the threshold established for this measure primarily due to the flat yield curve and management s expectation of flat to falling interest rates throughout we have positioned our average time deposit maturities in the six month to one year range based on the above  resulting in an increase in our liability sensitivity and positioning ourselves to take advantage of flat to falling interest rates 
the interest rate shock analysis is generally considered to be a better indicator of interest rate risk and it reflects this increase in liability sensitivity

savings and now accounts are equally distributed over months with a limit of of the total balance in the three to five year time frame  except for approximately million in a special savings accounts with a guaranteed rate through december   at which time the rate will adjust to a market rate of interest 
this balance is reflected in the day maturity time band  as any change in the rate will be effective for all of the following three months 
demand deposits and money market accounts are distributed over months with a limit of of the total balance in the one to three year time frame  except for approximately million in special rate money market accounts that are tied to changes in interest rate indices 
liquidity market and public confidence in our financial strength and that of financial institutions in general will largely determine the access to appropriate levels of liquidity 
this confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound credit quality and the ability to maintain appropriate levels of capital resources 

table of contents liquidity is defined as the ability to meet anticipated customer demands for funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis 
management measures the liquidity position by giving consideration to both on balance sheet and off balance sheet sources of and demands for funds on a daily and weekly basis 
sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  net of federal requirements to maintain reserves against deposit liabilities  investment securities eligible for sale or pledging to secure borrowings from dealers and customers pursuant to securities sold under agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements  loan repayments  loan sales  deposits and certain interest sensitive deposits  brokered deposits  a collateralized contingent line of credit at the frb discount window  a collateralized line of credit from the fhlb  and  borrowings under unsecured overnight federal funds lines available from correspondent banks 
the principal demands for liquidity are new loans  anticipated fundings under credit commitments to customers  and deposit withdrawals 
maintaining appropriate levels of capital is an important factor in determining the availability of critical sources of liquidity 
providers of liquidity could terminate or suspend liquidity availability or require additional or higher quality collateral in the event of a capital adequacy issue 
at december   capital ratios exceeded the federal regulatory levels required for a well capitalized institution 
the capital of the bank also exceeded the levels required by the gdbf 
management seeks to maintain a stable net liquidity position while optimizing operating results  as reflected in net interest income  the net yield on earning assets  and the cost of interest bearing liabilities in particular 
alco meets regularly to review the current and projected net liquidity positions and to review actions taken by management to achieve this liquidity objective 
levels of total liquidity  short term liquidity  and short term liquidity sources will be important in based on projected core loan growth and projected growth in both sba and indirect automobile loan production and sales  with sba loans held for sale balances  indirect automobile loans held for sale balances  and individual loans and pools of loans sold anticipated to increase from time to time during the year 
the consolidated statements of cash flows included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements present certain information about cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities 
while the statements present the periods net cash flows from lending and deposit activities  they do not reflect certain important aspects of our liquidity described above  including i anticipated liquidity requirements under new and outstanding credit commitments to customers  ii intra period volatility of deposits  particularly fluctuations in the volume of commercial customers noninterest bearing demand deposits  and iii unused borrowings available under unsecured federal funds lines  secured or collateralized lines  repurchase agreements  brokered deposits  and other arrangements 
our principal source of operating cash flows is net interest income 
the company has limited liquidity  and it relies primarily on equity  subordinated debt  and trust preferred securities  interest income  management fees  and dividends from the bank as sources of liquidity 
interest and dividends from subsidiaries ordinarily provide a source of liquidity to a bank holding company 
the bank pays interest to the company on the bank s subordinated debt and its short term investments in the bank and cash dividends on its preferred stock and common stock 
under the regulations of the gdbf  bank dividends may not exceed of the prior year s net earnings without approval from the gdbf 
if dividends received from the bank were reduced or eliminated  our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders would be adversely affected 
net cash flows from operating activities primarily result from net income adjusted for the following noncash items the provision for loan losses  depreciation  amortization  loans held for sale  and the lower of cost or market adjustments  if any 
net cash flows provided by operating activities in were negatively impacted primarily by million in loans originated for resale  offset in part by net income of million and proceeds from sale of loans  of million

in addition  the net cash flows used in investing activities were positively impacted by net cash inflows from investment securities of million 
net cash flows provided by financing activities were positively impacted by increases in demand deposits  money market accounts and savings accounts of million and in time deposits of million  offset in part by a decrease of million and million in short term debt and long term debt  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million as the significant net cash flows used in investing activities and the net cash flows used in operating activities were partially offset by net cash flows provided by financing activities  particularly the increase in deposits 
contractual obligations and other commitments the following schedule provides a summary of our financial commitments to make future payments  primarily to fund loan and other credit obligations  long term debt  and rental commitments primarily for the lease of branch facilities  the operations center  the sba lending office  and the commercial lending  construction lending  and executive offices as of december  payments for borrowings do not include interest 
payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in the underlying contracts 
loan commitments  lines of credit  and letters of credit are presented at contractual amounts  however  since many of these commitments are revolving commitments as discussed below and many are expected to expire unused or partially used  the total amount of these commitments does not necessarily reflect future cash requirements

certain residential construction and acquisition and development commitments relate to revolving commitments whereby payments are received as individual homes or parcels are sold  therefore  the outstanding balances at any one time will be less than the total commitment 
construction loan commitments in excess of one year have provisions to convert to term loans at the end of the construction period 
subordinated debt is comprised of four trust preferred security issuances in  and we have no obligations related to the trust preferred security holders other than to remit periodic interest payments and to remit principal and interest due at maturity 
each trust preferred security provides us the opportunity to prepay the securities at specified dates from inception  the fixed rate issues with declining premiums based on the time outstanding or at par after designated periods for all issues 
all long term borrowings are collateralized with investment grade securities or with pledged real estate loans 
leases and other rental agreements typically have renewal options either at predetermined rates or market rates on renewal 
purchase obligations include significant contractual obligations under legally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable and have greater than one year remaining at december  the majority of these amounts are primarily for services  including core processing systems and telecommunications maintenance

we maintain a diversified portfolio intended to spread risk and reduce exposure to economic downturns  which may occur in different segments of the economy or in particular industries 
industry and loan type diversification is reviewed quarterly 
management has taken numerous steps to reduce credit risk in the loan portfolio and to strengthen the credit risk management team and processes 
as a result of this program  the average credit scores of indirect automobile loans in the loan portfolio have increased significantly over the years  to an average fico credit score of at december  in addition  all credit policies have been reviewed and revised as necessary  and experienced managers are in place and have strengthened commercial lending and credit administration

nonperforming assets nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual and troubled debt restructured loans  if any  repossessions  and other real estate 
nonaccrual loans are loans on which the interest accruals have been discontinued when it appears that future collection of principal or interest according to the contractual terms may be doubtful 
troubled debt restructured loans are those loans whose terms have been modified  because of economic or legal reasons related to the debtors financial difficulties  to provide for a reduction in principal  change in terms  or modification of interest rates to below market levels

at december  and december   we held no other real estate or troubled debt restructured loans 
there was an  increase in repossessed assets and an increase of million in nonaccrual loans during the increase in nonperforming assets from december   to december   is due primarily to one real estate secured credit in the range from to million

allowance for loan losses as discussed in critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses  the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through provisions charged to operations 
such provisions are based on management s evaluation of the loan portfolio including loan portfolio concentrations  current economic conditions  the economic outlook  past loan loss experience  adequacy of underlying collateral  and such other factors which  in management s judgment  deserve consideration in estimating loan losses 
loans are charged off when  in the opinion of management  such loans are deemed to be uncollectible 
subsequently  recoveries are added to the allowance 
for all loan categories  historical loan loss experience  adjusted for changes in the risk characteristics of each loan category  current trends  and other factors  is used to determine the level of allowance required 
additional amounts are allocated based on the possible losses of individual troubled loans and the effect of economic conditions on both individual loans and loan categories 
since the allocation is based on estimates and subjective judgment  it is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts of losses that may ultimately occur 
in determining the allocated allowance  the consumer portfolios are treated as homogenous pools 
specific consumer loan types include direct and indirect automobile loans  other revolving lines of credit  residential first mortgage loans  and home equity loans 
the allowance for loan losses is allocated to the consumer loan types based on historical net charge off rates adjusted for any current or anticipated changes in these trends 
the commercial  commercial real estate  and business banking portfolios are evaluated separately 
within this group  every nonperforming loan and loans having greater than normal risk characteristics are reviewed for a specific allocation 
the allowance is allocated within the commercial portfolio based on a combination of historical loss rates  adjusted for those elements discussed in the preceding paragraph  and regulatory guidelines 
in determining the appropriate level for the allowance  management ensures that the overall allowance appropriately reflects a margin for the imprecision inherent in most estimates of the range of possible credit losses 
this additional allowance  if any  is reflected in the unallocated portion of the allowance
