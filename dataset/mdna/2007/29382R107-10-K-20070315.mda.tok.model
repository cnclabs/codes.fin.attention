item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the years ended december   and and consolidated financial condition as of december  and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document 
overview we are a diversified spanish language media company with a unique portfolio of television  radio and outdoor advertising assets  reaching approximately of all hispanics in the united states 
we operate in three reportable segments television broadcasting  radio broadcasting and outdoor advertising 
as of the date of filing this report  we own and or operate primary television stations that are located primarily in the southwestern united states 
we own and operate radio stations fm and am located primarily in arizona  california  colorado  florida  nevada  new mexico and texas 
our outdoor advertising segment consists of approximately  advertising faces located primarily in los angeles and new york 
the comparability of our results between and is significantly affected by acquisitions and dispositions in those periods 
in those years  we primarily acquired new media properties in markets where we already owned existing media properties 
while new media properties contribute to the financial results of their markets  we do not attempt to measure their effect as they typically are integrated into existing operations 
we generate revenue from sales of national and local advertising time on television and radio stations and advertising on our billboards 
advertising rates are  in large part  based on each medium s ability to attract audiences in demographic groups targeted by advertisers 
we recognize advertising revenue when commercials are broadcast and when outdoor advertising services are provided 
we do not obtain long term commitments from our advertisers and  consequently  they may cancel  reduce or postpone orders without penalties 
we pay commissions to agencies for local  regional and national advertising 
for contracts directly with agencies  we record net revenue from these agencies 
seasonal revenue fluctuations are common in the broadcasting and outdoor advertising industries and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by both local and national advertisers 
our primary expenses are employee compensation  including commissions paid to our sales staffs and amounts paid to our national representative firms  as well as expenses for marketing  promotion and selling  technical  local programming  engineering  leasing and general and administrative 
our local programming costs for television consist primarily of costs related to producing a local newscast in most of our markets 
highlights despite continuing competition for advertising revenue among broadcasters and between the broadcast industry and other media  we experienced net revenue growth of million for the year ended december  revenue generated by our television segment accounted for  revenue generated by our radio segment accounted for and revenue generated by our outdoor segment accounted for of our total revenue 
our television segment led our success again in  generating million in net revenue as we continued to sustain solid ratings across our station group 
our television results were driven by continued growth in our top advertising categories  including automotive  services  fast food restaurants and telecommunications 
the strength of our television results was also partially attributable to world cup and political advertising 
we currently anticipate that the general demand for our advertising inventory will increase in future periods 
however  we would need to overcome strong revenue comparables from such major 
table of contents events as world cup and political activity in both the us and mexico if we are to match the rate of revenue increase we experienced in we cannot give any assurance that sustaining such rate of increased revenue growth in is achievable 
we continue to enjoy significant revenue growth from our television stations located in certain markets with rapidly growing hispanic populations  such as las vegas  albuquerque  palm springs  yuma el centro  santa barbara  reno and odessa midland  each of which experienced greater than net revenue growth in based on stations we operated for the full year  our radio segment outperformed the general radio industry as a whole contributing million in net revenue in on the other hand  the segment also faced challenges during the year  with certain markets either not experiencing revenue growth or not growing at a rate higher than that of the general radio industry 
in addressing this  we continued our strategy of divesting assets in markets where we did not see the opportunity to grow to scale and build out clusters 
for example  in january we disposed of the assets of radio stations kbrg fm and klok am  serving the san francisco san jose  california market  in september  we disposed of the assets of radio station kzlz fm  serving the tucson market  and in november we disposed of the assets of all of our radio stations serving the dallas  texas market 
this strategy also allows us to redeploy capital to markets with greater growth and earnings potential 
additionally  we continue to focus on local sales efforts  which accounted for of total sales in also  in  we determined that certain of our radio assets were impaired  for which we recognized impairment losses of million relating to goodwill and million relating to fcc licenses in the dallas and denver markets 
the impairment was primarily related to a general slowing of growth in the radio industry over recent quarters 
please see sensitivity of critical accounting estimates  beginning at page below 
our outdoor segment provided million of our net revenue in  and benefited from continuing overall demand for outdoor advertising in new york  sacramento and fresno  california and tampa  florida 
in addition  increased local sales played a key role in the growth of our outdoor advertising operations in we have made a concerted effort to strengthen the staffing and training of our local sales force  and we anticipate that this focus will continue in we also continue to grow our transit advertising operations 
in may  we entered into a five year agreement with the hillsborough transit authority to sell advertising on municipal buses in the tampa  florida market 
we believe that expanding our transit advertising creates opportunities to provide broader advertising coverage for national advertisers 
acquisitions and dispositions in february  we acquired the assets of television stations ktiz lp  ksfe lp  klia lp and kftn lp in the mcallen  texas market for million in exchange for approximately million in cash and the assets of television station ktfv ca in the mcallen  texas market 
in july  we acquired a full power television construction permit in derby  kansas for million in an auction held by the fcc 
in july  we acquired the assets of radio station kboc fm in dallas  texas for million 
in august  we acquired the assets of television station knez lp now kxof ca in the laredo  texas market for million 
we evaluated the transferred set of activities  assets  inputs  outputs and processes from each of our completed acquisitions and determined that the items excluded were significant and that each of these acquisitions was not considered a business 

table of contents in january  we sold the assets of radio stations kbrg fm and klok am  serving the san francisco san jose  california market  to univision for million 
the full amount of the purchase price was paid in the form of  shares of our class u common stock held by univision based on the ten day volume weighted average share price of between december  and december  we realized a gain on sale of million  net of tax of million 
we had a loss of approximately million related to the closure of the san francisco san jose facility 
in september  we sold the assets of radio station kzlz fm serving the tucson  arizona market for million 
we realized a gain on sale of million  net of tax of million 
in november  we sold the assets of all of our radio stations serving the dallas  texas market  including the assets of kboc fm which the company acquired in july for an adjusted purchase price of million 
we realized a gain on sale of million 
the carrying value of certain of the assets had been adjusted to fair value less costs to sell  resulting in an impairment charge of million  net of tax of million  in the second quarter of the assets sold in did not constitute a component set under sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  therefore  there is no presentation of discontinued operations 
relationship with univision univision currently owns less than of our common stock on a fully converted basis 
as of december   univision owned approximately of our common stock on a fully converted basis 
in connection with its merger with hispanic broadcasting corporation in september  univision entered into an agreement with the us department of justice  or doj  pursuant to which univision agreed  among other things  to ensure that its percentage ownership of our company would not exceed by march  and will not exceed by march  in january  we sold the assets of radio stations kbrg fm and klok am  serving the san francisco san jose  california market  to univision for million 
univision paid the full amount of the purchase price in the form of approximately million shares of our class u common stock held by univision 
in march  we repurchased seven million shares of our class u common stock held by univision for million using cash generated from operations and unrestricted proceeds which were remaining from our refinanced syndicated bank credit facility 
in july  the company repurchased  shares of class u common stock held by univision for million 
univision is the holder of all of our issued and outstanding class u common stock 
the class u common stock has limited voting rights and does not include the right to elect directors 
however  as the holder of all of our issued and outstanding class u common stock  univision currently has the right to approve any merger  consolidation or other business combination involving our company  any dissolution of our company and any assignment of the federal communications commission  or fcc  licenses for any of our company s univision affiliated television stations 
each share of class u common stock is automatically convertible into one share of our class a common stock subject to adjustment for stock splits  dividends or combinations in connection with any transfer to a third party that is not an affiliate of univision 
pursuant to an investor rights agreement  as amended  between univision and us  univision has a right to demand the registration of the sale of shares of our class u common that it owns  which may be exercised on or before march  univision acts as the company s exclusive sales representative for the sale of all national advertising aired on univision affiliate television stations 
during the years ended december  and  the amount paid by the company to univision in this capacity was and million  respectively 
in addition  in june  univision publicly announced a sale of univision to a private equity consortium  and while we cannot predict the effect that such sale would have on our business or our results of operations  we currently do not believe that such sale will have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations 

table of contents results of operations separate financial data for each of the company s operating segments is provided below 
segment operating profit loss is defined as operating profit loss before corporate expenses and loss gain on sale of assets 
the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on the following unaudited  in thousands years ended december  change to change to net revenue television radio outdoor consolidated direct operating expenses television radio outdoor consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses television radio outdoor consolidated depreciation and amortization television radio outdoor consolidated segment operating profit loss television radio outdoor consolidated corporate expenses gain on sale of assets impairment charge operating income loss consolidated adjusted ebitda capital expenditures television radio outdoor consolidated total assets television radio outdoor assets held for sale radio consolidated footnotes on next page 
table of contents footnotes from preceding page percentage not meaningful 
consolidated adjusted ebitda means operating income loss plus loss gain on sale of assets  depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment loss  non cash stock based compensation included in operating and corporate expenses  non cash corporate expense and syndication programming amortization less syndication programming payments 
we use the term consolidated adjusted ebitda because that measure is defined in our syndicated bank credit facility and does not include non cash stock based compensation  non cash corporate expense  non cash impairment loss  loss gain on sale of assets and syndication programming amortization and does include syndication programming payments 
the definition of operating income loss  and thus consolidated adjusted ebitda  excludes equity in net earnings loss of nonconsolidated affiliates 
since our ability to borrow from our syndicated bank credit facility is based on a consolidated adjusted ebitda financial covenant  we believe that it is important to disclose consolidated adjusted ebitda to our investors 
our syndicated bank credit facility contains certain financial covenants relating to maximum net debt ratio  senior debt ratio  maximum capital expenditures and fixed charge coverage ratio 
the maximum net debt ratio  or the ratio of consolidated total debt minus cash  up to a maximum of million  to consolidated adjusted ebitda  affects our ability to borrow from our syndicated bank credit facility 
under our syndicated bank credit facility  our maximum net debt ratio may not exceed to on a pro forma basis for the prior full year 
the actual maximum net debt ratios were as follows in each case as of december  to  to  to therefore  we were in compliance with this covenant at each of those dates 
we entered into our new syndicated bank credit facility in september  so we were not subject to the same calculations and covenants in prior years 
however  for consistency of presentation  the foregoing historical ratios assume that our current definition had been applicable for all periods presented 
the maximum net debt ratio also affects the interest rate charged for revolving loans  thus affecting our interest expense 
while many in the financial community and we consider consolidated adjusted ebitda to be important  it should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as cash flows from operating activities  operating income and net income 
as consolidated adjusted ebitda excludes non cash gain loss on sale of assets  non cash depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment loss  non cash stock based compensation awards  non cash corporate expense and syndication programming amortization and includes syndication programming payments  consolidated adjusted ebitda has certain limitations because it excludes and includes several important non cash financial line items 
therefore  we consider both non gaap and gaap measures when evaluating our business 
consolidated adjusted ebitda is a non gaap measure 
the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to consolidated adjusted ebitda is cash flows from operating activities 
a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to cash flows from operating activities follows in thousands

excluding the and net revenue contributed by our radio stations in the san francisco san jose  tucson and dallas markets that we sold in  net revenue would have increased by million during the year ended december  of the overall increase  million came from our television segment 
the increase from this segment was primarily attributable to an increase in both local and national advertising sales  primarily attributable to an increase in 
table of contents advertising rates  partially attributable to world cup and political advertising 
additionally  million of the overall increase was from our outdoor segment  primarily attributable to revenue associated with the expansion of our outdoor division in tampa and sacramento  as well as an increase in local advertising sales 
the overall increase was partially offset by a million decrease in our radio net revenue 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in net revenue of million from our san francisco san jose  tucson and dallas radio stations that we sold  partially offset by an increase in inventory sold and advertising rates 
we currently anticipate that the number of advertisers purchasing spanish language advertising will continue to rise and will result in greater demand for our inventory 
we expect that this increased demand will  in turn  allow us to continue to increase our rates  resulting in continued increases in net revenue in future periods

the decrease was primarily attributable to severance amounts paid to the former president of our outdoor division in  partially offset by additional expenses associated with the expansion of our outdoor division in sacramento 
liquidity and capital resources while we have had a history of operating losses in some periods and operating income in other periods  we also have a history of generating significant positive cash flows from our operations 
we expect to fund anticipated cash requirements including acquisitions  anticipated capital expenditures  payments of principal and interest on outstanding indebtedness and repurchases of our class a common stock with cash on hand  cash flows from operations and externally generated funds  such as proceeds from any debt or equity offering and our syndicated bank credit facility 
we currently anticipate that funds generated from operations and available borrowings under our syndicated bank credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
in january  we acquired approximately million shares of our class u common stock held by univision in exchange for the assets of radio stations kbrg fm and klok am  serving the san francisco san jose  california market 
in march  we repurchased seven million shares of our class u common stock held by univision for million using cash generated from operations and unrestricted proceeds which were remaining from our refinanced syndicated bank credit facility 
on november   our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program 
we are authorized to repurchase up to million of our outstanding class a common stock from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing market prices  block trades and private repurchases 
the extent and timing of any repurchases will depend on market conditions and other factors 
we intend to finance stock repurchases  if and when made  with available cash on hand and cash provided by operations 
as of december   we had repurchased approximately million shares at an average price of for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 

table of contents syndicated bank credit facility in september  we refinanced our former syndicated bank credit facility with a new million senior secured syndicated bank credit facility  consisting of a year million term loan and a year million revolving facility 
the term loan under the new syndicated bank credit facility has been drawn in full  the proceeds of which were used i to refinance million outstanding borrowings under our former syndicated bank credit facility  ii to complete a tender offer for our previously outstanding million senior subordinated notes  and iii for general corporate purposes 
the term loan matures in and is subject to automatic quarterly reductions of million starting on january  the revolving facility expires in our ability to make additional borrowings under the syndicated bank credit facility is subject to compliance with certain financial covenants  including financial ratios  and other conditions set forth in the syndicated bank credit facility 
our syndicated bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets  as well as the pledge of the stock of substantially all of our subsidiaries  including our special purpose subsidiary formed to hold our fcc licenses 
our term loan bears interest at libor plus a margin of  for a total interest rate of at december  as of december   million of our term loan was outstanding 
as of december   we had three interest rate swap agreements with a million aggregate notional amount  that convert a portion of our variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation of  which includes a margin of

our revolving facility bears interest at libor plus a margin ranging from to based on our leverage covenants 
as of december   we had approximately million in outstanding letters of credit and million was available under our revolving facility for future borrowings 
in addition  we pay a quarterly unused commitment fee ranging from to per annum  depending on the level of facility used 
our syndicated bank credit facility contains customary events of default 
if an event of default occurs and is continuing  we may be required to repay all amounts then outstanding under the syndicated bank credit facility 
lenders holding more than of the loans and commitments under the syndicated bank credit facility may elect to accelerate the maturity of loans upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default 
our syndicated bank credit facility contains a mandatory prepayment clause  triggered in the event that i the proceeds of certain asset dispositions are not utilized as provided under the syndicated bank credit facility within months of such disposition  ii insurance or condemnation proceeds are not utilized as provided under the syndicated bank credit facility within days following receipt thereof  or iii the proceeds from capital contributions or equity offerings are not utilized to acquire businesses or properties relating to radio  television and outdoor advertising within days following such capital contribution or equity offering 
in addition  if we incur certain additional indebtedness  then of such proceeds must be used to reduce our outstanding loan balance  and if we have excess cash flow  as defined in our syndicated bank credit facility  then of such excess cash flow must be used to reduce our outstanding loan balance 
our syndicated bank credit facility contains certain financial covenants relating to maximum net debt ratio  senior debt ratio  maximum capital expenditures and fixed charge coverage ratio 
the covenants become increasingly restrictive in the later years of the syndicated bank credit facility 
our syndicated bank credit facility also requires us to maintain our fcc licenses for our broadcast properties and contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt  the payment of dividends  the making of acquisitions and the sale of assets over a certain limit 
additionally  we entered into three interest rate swap agreements because our leverage exceeded certain limits 
see also the section entitled derivative instruments below 

table of contents we can draw on our revolving facility without prior approval for working capital needs and for acquisitions having an aggregate maximum consideration of million or less 
proposed acquisitions are conditioned upon our delivery to the agent bank of a covenant compliance certificate showing pro forma calculations assuming such acquisition had been consummated and revised revenue projections for the acquired properties 
for acquisitions having an aggregate maximum consideration in excess of million  consent is required from lenders holding more than of the loans and commitments under the syndicated bank credit facility 
derivative instruments as of december   we had three interest rate swap agreements with a million aggregate notional amount  with quarterly reductions  that expire on october  these interest rate swap agreements convert a portion of our variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation of  which includes a margin of 
it is expected that as the notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements declines  the term loan amounts will continue to exceed the notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements 
the excess loan amount outstanding over the notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements will incur interest at libor plus 
as of december   these interest rate swap agreements were not designated for hedge accounting treatment under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  and as a result  changes in their fair values are reflected currently in earnings 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was million and is classified as other assets on our balance sheet 
for the year ended december   we recognized a reduction of million of interest expense related to the increase in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements 
in february  we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement with a million aggregate notional amount  with quarterly increases  that expires on october  this interest rate swap agreement converts a portion of our variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation of  which includes a margin of 
the quarterly increases of this swap agreement match the quarterly reductions of the three previous interest rate swap agreements 
therefore  it is expected that the term loan amounts will not exceed the notional amount of the four interest rate swap agreements 
this interest rate swap agreement will not be designated for hedge accounting treatment under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  and as a result  changes in the fair values will be reflected in earnings as a component of interest expense 
debt and equity financing on may   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec to register up to million of equity and debt securities  which we may offer from time to time 
that shelf registration statement has been declared effective by the sec 
we have not yet issued any securities under the shelf registration statement 
we intend to use the proceeds of any issuance of securities under the shelf registration statement to fund acquisitions or capital expenditures  to reduce or refinance debt or other obligations  and for general corporate purposes 
on november   our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program 
we are authorized to repurchase up to million of our outstanding class a common stock from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing market prices  block trades and private repurchases 
the extent and timing of any repurchases will depend on market conditions and other factors 
we intend to finance stock repurchases  if and when made  with available cash on hand and cash provided by operations 
as of december   we had repurchased approximately million shares at an average price of for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 

table of contents consolidated adjusted ebitda consolidated adjusted ebitda as defined below increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net revenue  consolidated adjusted ebitda increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  we currently anticipate that consolidated adjusted ebitda will continue to increase in future periods as we believe that net revenue increases will continue to outpace increases in direct operating  selling  general and administrative and corporate expenses 
consolidated adjusted ebitda means operating income loss plus loss gain on sale of assets  depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment loss  non cash stock based compensation included in operating and corporate expenses  non cash corporate expense and syndication programming amortization less syndication programming payments 
we use the term consolidated adjusted ebitda because that measure is defined in our syndicated bank credit facility and does not include non cash stock based compensation  non cash corporate expense  non cash impairment loss  loss gain on sale of assets and syndication programming amortization and does include syndication programming payments 
the definition of operating income loss  and thus consolidated adjusted ebitda  excludes equity in net earnings loss of nonconsolidated affiliates 
since our ability to borrow from our syndicated bank credit facility is based on a consolidated adjusted ebitda financial covenant  we believe that it is important to disclose consolidated adjusted ebitda to our investors 
our syndicated bank credit facility contains certain financial covenants relating to maximum net debt ratio  senior debt ratio  maximum capital expenditures and fixed charge coverage ratio 
the maximum net debt ratio  or the ratio of consolidated total debt minus cash  up to a maximum of million  to consolidated adjusted ebitda  affects our ability to borrow from our syndicated bank credit facility 
under our syndicated bank credit facility  our maximum net debt ratio may not exceed to on a pro forma basis for the prior full four quarters 
the actual maximum net debt ratios were as follows in each case as of december  to  to  to therefore  we were in compliance with this covenant at each of those dates 
we entered into our new syndicated bank credit facility in september  so we were not subject to the same calculations and covenants in prior years 
however  for consistency of presentation  the foregoing historical ratios assume that our current definition had been applicable for all periods presented 
the maximum net debt ratio also affects the interest rate charged for revolving loans  thus affecting our interest expense 
while many in the financial community and we consider consolidated adjusted ebitda to be important  it should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as cash flows from operating activities  operating income and net income 
as consolidated adjusted ebitda excludes non cash gain loss on sale of assets  non cash depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment loss  non cash stock based compensation awards  non cash corporate expense and syndication programming amortization and includes syndication programming payments  consolidated adjusted ebitda has certain limitations because it excludes and includes several important non cash financial line items 
therefore  we consider both non gaap and gaap measures when evaluating our business 
consolidated adjusted ebitda is a non gaap measure 
for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted ebitda to cash flows from operating activities  its most directly comparable gaap financial measure  please see page cash flow net cash flow provided by operating activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  although we had a net loss of million for the year ended december   we had positive cash flow from operations 
our net loss was primarily a 
table of contents result of non cash expenses  including impairment charges of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
the increase in net cash flow provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher revenue of million  partially offset by higher operating expenses 
we expect to continue to have positive cash flow from operating activities for the year for the year ended december   net cash flow provided by investing activities was million  whereas for the year ended december   net cash flow used in investing activities was million 
during the year ended december   we sold the assets of radio stations in the tucson  arizona market and the dallas  texas market for million 
we spent million on net capital expenditures and acquisition of intangibles and collected million on a note receivable 
we plan to use some of the proceeds for capital expenditures and future acquisitions 
for the year ended december   net cash flow used in financing activities was million  whereas for the year ended december   net cash flow provided by financing activities was million 
during the year ended december   we paid million to repurchase million shares of our class u common stock from univision and paid approximately million to repurchase million shares of our class a common stock under our stock repurchase program 
we made net debt payments of million and received net proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options and from the sale of shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
we plan to continue to repurchase our class a common stock from time to time in future periods in open market transactions at prevailing market prices  block trades or private repurchases 
during  we anticipate that our maintenance capital expenditures will be approximately million 
in addition to our maintenance capital expenditures  we anticipate that our digital capital expenditures will be approximately million 
we anticipate paying for these capital expenditures out of net cash flow from operations 
as part of the transition from analog to digital television service  full service television station owners are required  as a result of legislation that went into effect in early  to discontinue broadcasting analog signals and to relinquish one of their paired analog digital channels to the fcc on february  we currently expect the cost to complete construction of digital television facilities for our remaining full service television stations  for which we have sought waivers from the fcc  will be approximately million 
in addition  we have elected to continue to broadcast separate digital and analog signals throughout this transition period 
we currently anticipate that the incremental costs of broadcasting in digital and analog  including additional rent and higher electricity expense  will be approximately  in we intend to finance the conversion to digital television by using net cash flow from operations 
the amount of our anticipated capital expenditures may change based on future changes in business plans  our financial condition and general economic conditions 
we continually review  and are currently reviewing  opportunities to acquire additional television and radio stations  as well as other broadcast or media opportunities targeting the hispanic market in the united states 
we expect to finance any future acquisitions through net cash flow from operations  borrowings under our syndicated bank credit facility and additional debt and equity financing 
any additional financing  if needed  might not be available to us on reasonable terms or at all 
any failure to raise capital when needed could seriously harm our business and our acquisition strategy 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced 
furthermore  these equity securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our class a common stock

application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are the most important to the accurate portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies require management s subjective judgment and may produce materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our 
table of contents board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed and approved our related disclosure in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following are our critical accounting policies goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets effective january  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and determined each of our operating segments to be a reporting unit 
upon adoption  we assigned all of our assets and liabilities to our reporting units and ceased amortizing goodwill and our indefinite life intangible assets 
we believe that our broadcast licenses are indefinite life intangible assets 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets and our estimates of the useful lives of our long lived assets are critical accounting estimates because goodwill and other intangible assets are our most significant assets  and the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet  as well as on our results of operations  could be material 
accordingly  the assumptions about future cash flows on the assets under evaluation are critical 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  we must make assumptions about the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
assumptions about future revenue and cash flows require significant judgment because of the current state of the economy and the fluctuation of actual revenue and the timing of expenses 
we develop future revenue estimates based on projected ratings increases  planned timing of signal strength upgrades  planned timing of promotional events  customer commitments and available advertising time 
estimates of future cash flows assume that expenses will grow at rates consistent with historical rates 
alternatively  some stations under evaluation have had limited relevant cash flow history due to planned conversion of format or upgrade of station signal 
the assumptions about cash flows after conversion reflect estimates of how these stations are expected to perform based on similar stations and markets and possible proceeds from the sale of the assets 
if the expected cash flows are not realized  impairment losses may be recorded in the future 
for goodwill  the impairment evaluation includes a comparison of the carrying value of each reporting unit including goodwill to that reporting unit s fair value 
if the reporting unit s estimated fair value exceeds the reporting unit s carrying value  no impairment of goodwill exists 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the unit s carrying value  then an additional analysis is performed to allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if that unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the unit was the purchase price 
if the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities is less than the carrying value of the unit s goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
the impairment evaluation for indefinite life intangible assets is performed by a comparison of the asset s carrying value to the asset s fair value 
when the carrying value exceeds fair value an impairment charge is recorded for the amount of the difference 
an intangible asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life when there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or any other factors that may limit the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows 
in addition  we evaluate annually and when triggering events occur  the remaining useful life of an intangible asset that is not being amortized to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if an intangible asset that is not being amortized is determined to have a finite useful life  the asset will be amortized prospectively over the estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as intangible assets subject to amortization 

table of contents long lived assets  including intangibles subject to amortization depreciation and amortization of our long lived assets is provided using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
changes in circumstances  such as the passage of new laws or changes in regulations  technological advances  changes to our business model or changes in our capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from initial estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be revised  we will depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value over its revised remaining useful life 
factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment  customer attrition  contractual amendments or mandated regulatory requirements could result in shortened useful lives 
long lived assets and asset groups are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
long lived assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value in the period in which the determination is made 
deferred taxes deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
we have recorded a million tax benefit for net operating losses that are expected to offset future taxable income 
our net operating loss benefits will expire from to in order to realize the value of those assets  we would need to generate an aggregate of approximately million of taxable income prior to their expiration 
we currently estimate that we will recognize adequate taxable income over the next five to ten years sufficient to realize the value of these assets 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is determined to be more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the carrying value of the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period in which such determination is made 
revenue recognition television and radio revenue related to the sale of advertising is recognized at the time of broadcast 
revenue for outdoor advertising space is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically less than months 
revenue contracts with advertising agencies are recorded at an amount that is net of the commission retained by the agency 
revenue from contacts directly with the advertisers is recorded at gross revenue and the related commission or national representation fee is recorded in operating expense 
cash payments received prior to services rendered result in deferred revenue  which is then recognized as revenue when the advertising time or space is actually provided 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable consist of a homogeneous pool of relatively small dollar amounts from a large number of customers 
we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors 
when we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 

table of contents derivative instruments sfas no 
requires us to recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship  and further  on the type of hedging relationship 
as of december   we had three interest rate swap agreements with a million aggregate notional amount  with quarterly reductions  that expire on october  as of december   these interest rate swap agreements were not designated for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 and as a result  the increase in fair value is classified as a reduction of interest expense on our statements of operations 
for the year ended december   we recognized a reduction of million in interest expense related to the increase in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements

sensitivity of critical accounting estimates we have critical accounting estimates that are sensitive to change 
the most significant of those sensitive estimates relate to the impairment of intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not amortized but are tested annually on october for impairment  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and 
table of contents indefinite life intangible assets  we must make assumptions about the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
television we conducted a valuation of our television reporting unit in and determined that the fair value of the television reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately million  which we believed was a significant difference 
our performance has since been consistent with the projections in the valuation 
additionally  our television reporting unit has not changed dramatically since the valuation 
since our operating results have been consistent with the projections and our television reporting unit has not changed materially  we believe that the fair value of our television reporting unit still exceeds the carrying value and we do not have any impairment 
radio in the letter of intent issued in accordance with the sale of certain of the dallas radio assets  including fcc licenses  the expected sales price was less than the carrying value  which indicated that other radio assets might be impaired 
as a result of the sale of the dallas radio assets  we engaged an independent appraiser experienced in valuing radio broadcast properties to conduct an appraisal of the fair value of our radio reporting unit as of june  the valuation of the fair value of the radio reporting unit was primarily determined by evaluating discounted cash flow models for the reporting unit 
the assumptions in the models were based on the reporting unit s projected ability to generate cash flows in various cities or nearby cities  which we refer to as market clusters  based on signal coverage of the markets and on the reporting unit s actual historical results and expected future cash flows in each market cluster 
in order to corroborate the fair market value estimated by the discounted cash flow analysis  the valuation considered recent comparable sales 
based on the assumptions and projections  the radio reporting unit s fair value was less than its carrying value 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  the company recognized impairment losses of million relating to goodwill and million relating to fcc licenses in the dallas and denver markets in the second quarter of the impairment of goodwill and the impairment of the denver fcc licenses were primarily related to a general slowing of growth in the radio industry over recent quarters 
the impairment of the dallas fcc licenses was primarily related to increased competition and a general slowing of growth in the radio industry over recent quarters resulting in the write down of our assets in the dallas market to fair value prior to their sale in november in calculating the estimated fair value of our radio reporting unit  the appraisal used discounted cash flow models that rely on various assumptions  such as future cash flows  discount rates and multiples 
our estimates of future cash flows assume that our radio segment revenues will increase significantly faster than the increase in our radio expenses  and therefore our radio assets will also increase in value 
if any of the estimates of future cash flows  discount rates  multiples or assumptions were to change in any future valuation  it could affect our impairment analysis and cause us to record an additional expense for impairment 
outdoor we engaged an independent appraiser experienced in valuing advertising properties to conduct an appraisal of the fair value of our outdoor reporting unit in accordance with our annual impairment testing 
the appraiser relied primarily on a discounted cash flow model for its valuation and confirmed their valuation with an analysis of comparable sales 
as a result of that valuation we believed that the estimated fair value of the outdoor reporting unit was below its carrying value by million  suggesting potential impairment 
since we had an indicator of potential impairment  as required under sfas no 
we allocated the fair value of the entire outdoor reporting unit among its identifiable assets  which consist primarily of fixed assets  customer list and goodwill 
after allocating the estimated fair value to the components  the implied fair value of the goodwill component exceeded its carrying value  so we determined that there is no impairment of goodwill 

table of contents we then evaluated the fixed assets and customer list of our outdoor reporting unit in accordance with sfas no 
 as they are classified as long lived assets 
as required under sfas no 
 we compared the outdoor reporting unit s undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of all of the reporting unit s assets 
we determined that the sum of its projected undiscounted cash flows  including the estimated value of our billboards  exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit s assets  resulting in the recovery of its value and no impairment of the long lived assets 
in calculating the estimated fair value of our outdoor reporting unit  the appraisal used a discounted cash flow model that relies on various assumptions  such as future cash flows  discount rates and multiples 
our estimates of future cash flows assume that we will significantly increase our outdoor revenues as compared with our outdoor expenses  and therefore our billboards will also increase in value 
if those estimates of future cash flows  discount rates  multiples or assumptions were to change in any future valuation  it could affect our impairment analysis and cause us to record an expense for impairment 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for each of our fiscal years in the three year period ended december  however  there can be no assurance that future inflation would not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into three interest rate swap agreements  and an additional interest rate swap agreement in february  described more fully in item a below 
we have an affiliation agreement with telemundo that grants telemundo a interest in the appreciation of xhas tv above million  plus capital expenditures and certain other adjustments  upon certain liquidity events as defined in the agreements 
we do not have any majority owned subsidiaries or any interests in  or relationships with  any material variable interest entities that are not included in the consolidated financial statements 
except for the items discussed above  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities other than lease commitments  legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of business and employment contracts for key employees 
the carrying amount of our interest rate swap agreements are recorded at fair market value and any changes to the value are recorded as an increase or decrease in interest expense 
the fair market value of each interest rate swap agreement is determined by estimating the future discounted cash flows of any future payments that may be made under such agreement 
we converted a portion of our variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation at september  in february  we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement  as a result of which we do not expect that our term loan amounts will exceed the notional amounts of the interest rate swap agreements 
if the future interest yield curve decreases  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements will decrease and interest expense will increase 
if the future interest yield curve increases  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements will increase and interest expense will decrease 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the potential loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in the financial markets 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in the base rates on our variable rate debt 
however  as of february  we have four swap arrangements that convert the entire amount of our variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation 
under our syndicated bank credit facility  if we exceed certain leverage ratios we would be required to enter into derivative financial instrument transactions  such as swaps or interest rate caps  in order to manage or reduce our exposure to risk from changes in interest rates 
under no circumstances do we enter into derivatives or other financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes

the excess loan amount outstanding over the notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements will incur interest at libor plus 
as of december   these interest rate swap agreements were not designated for hedge accounting treatment under sfas  and as a result  changes in their fair values are reflected currently in earnings 
at december   the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was million and is classified as other assets on our balance sheet 
in february  we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement with a million aggregate notional amount  with quarterly increases  that expires on october  this interest rate swap agreement converts a portion of our variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation of  which includes a margin of 
the quarterly increases of this swap agreement match the quarterly reductions of the three previous interest rate swap agreements

the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship  and further  on the type of hedging relationship 
as of december   our interest rate swap agreements were not designated for hedge accounting treatment under sfas  and as a result  the fair value is classified as other assets on the our balance sheet and as a reduction of interest expense on our statements of operations 
for the year ended december   we recognized a reduction of million of interest expense related to the increase in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements 
we converted a portion of our variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation at september  in february  we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement  as a result of which we do not expect that our term loan amounts will exceed the notional amounts of the interest rate swap agreements 
if the future interest yield curve decreases  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements will decrease and interest expense will increase 
if the future interest yield curve increases  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements will increase and interest expense will decrease
