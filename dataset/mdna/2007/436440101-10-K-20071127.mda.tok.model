item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and the information described under the caption risk factors below 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements and product warranties  accounts receivable reserves  inventory and related reserves  valuations and purchase price allocations related to business combinations  expected cash flows used to evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets  estimated fair values of long lived assets used to record impairment charges related to intangible assets and goodwill  amortization periods  accrued expenses  restructuring and other related charges  stock based compensation  pension liabilities  contingent liabilities  and recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the 
table of contents circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory our inventories include material  labor and overhead  and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
as a designer and manufacturer of high technology medical equipment  we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures on products and prices  reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
if inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs as cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
additionally  purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are primarily based on our estimates of forecasted net sales and service usage levels 
a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess or expired inventory in the future 
we record provisions for excess or obsolete inventory as cost of sales 
accounts receivable reserves we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly evaluate the collectability of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors  which may include dialogue with the customer to determine the cause of non payment  the use of collection agencies  and or the use of litigation 
in the event it is determined that the customer may not be able to meet its full obligation to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount that we expect to recover given all information present 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and our assessment of the customer s current credit worthiness 
we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in the future 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we also record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on the specific facts and circumstances of particular orders  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the data we use to 
table of contents calculate these estimates do not properly reflect reserve requirements  then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be adversely affected 
our accounts receivable reserves were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in the reserves in fiscal was primarily due to the addition of  of reserves as a result of our acquisitions of aeg  r technology  inc and suros surgical systems  inc 
during fiscal also contributing to the increased reserves  but to a lesser extent  was our increase in sales during fiscal the increase in reserves in fiscal was primarily due to our increase in revenues during the year 
accounts receivable reserve has decreased as a percentage of sales as a result of our historical collection experience 
valuation of business combinations we record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in recent business combinations under the purchase method of accounting 
amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition 
we then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill 
the valuation of purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value at the dates of acquisition related to in process projects 
our purchased research and development represents the value of in process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition 
we expense the value attributable to these in process projects at the time of the acquisition 
if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner  we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects  or for the acquisitions as a whole 
we use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development 
this approach determines fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to an in process project over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes  expected market growth rates  expected trends in technology and expected product introductions by competitors 
in arriving at the value of the in process projects  we consider  among other factors  the in process projects stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date  the costs already incurred  the projected costs to complete  the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets  the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology 
we base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors 
for the in process projects we acquired in connection with our fiscal acquisitions  we used risk adjusted discount rates to discount our projected cash flows  ranging from to 
we believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
we did not acquire in process research and development in connection with the fiscal acquisition of biolucent 
we have also used the income approach  as described above  to determine the estimated fair value of certain other identifiable intangibles assets including developed technology  customer relationships and tradenames 
developed technology represents patented and unpatented technology and know how 
customer relationships represent established relationships with customers  which provides a ready channel for the sale of additional products and services 
tradenames represent acquired product names that we intend to continue to utilize 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we record intangible assets at historical cost 
we amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight line method or based on estimated future cash flows to approximate the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset will be utilized 
amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives 
table of contents ranging from to years 
we review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life 
conditions that would indicate impairment and trigger a more frequent impairment assessment include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows  we will write down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified 
we generally calculate fair value as the present value of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
if the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed  we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 
in connection with sale of certain intellectual property  previously acquired from fischer to siemens ag  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million during the fourth quarter of fiscal the impairment charge was the result of a higher carrying value of such assets as compared to their fair value 
the charge is a component of the net gain on sale of intellectual property of million and is classified as part of the mammography segment 
consistent with prior years  we conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill during the second quarter of fiscal in performing the test  we utilize the two step approach prescribed under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units  as defined  to the fair value of these units 
we considered a number of factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit  including an independent valuation to conduct this test 
the valuation is based upon expected future discounted operating cash flows of the reporting unit as well as analysis of recent sales or offerings of similar companies 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
since the adoption of statement no 
 we have not performed the second step of the impairment test because the fair value of each reporting unit has exceeded its respective carrying value 
there were no impairment indicators identified during the remainder of fiscal that required a re assessment of the annual impairment test 
the estimate of fair value requires significant judgment 
any loss resulting from an impairment test would be reflected in operating income in our consolidated statements of income 
the annual impairment testing process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
pension liabilities in connection with our acquisition of aeg  we sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering the employees of our aeg german subsidiary 
on september   the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
sfas requires an entity to recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a defined benefit post retirement plan s overfunded status or a liability for a plan s underfunded status  measure a defined benefit post retirement plan s assets and obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year  and recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit post retirement plan in comprehensive income in the year in which changes occur 
sfas does not change the amount of net periodic benefit cost included in net income or address the various measurement issues associated with post retirement benefit plan accounting 
as required by sfas no 
 we used a prospective approach in our adoption of sfas no 
as of september   we recognized the unfunded status of its deferred benefit pension plan 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not impact our compliance with our debt covenants under its credit agreements  cash position or results of operations 
as of september   we have recorded a pension liability  based upon an actuarial valuation  of approximately million as a component of accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the selection of the assumptions used 
table of contents to determine pension expense or income involves significant judgment 
our actuarial assumptions and discount rate assumptions are considered the key variables in determining pension expense or income 
the discount rate assumption was determined by using a model consisting of theoretical bond portfolios that closely match the various durations of that of our pension liability 
the discount rate assumption we used for our german pension benefits plans was 
the discount rate is dependent on the participation level of the particular countries covered within the plans 
therefore  the discount rate is consistent with the fact that the pension is german based 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue upon shipment  provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  there are no uncertainties regarding acceptance  the sales price is fixed or determinable  no rights of return exist and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
generally  our product arrangements are multiple element arrangements  including services such as installation and training 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began accounting for these arrangements in accordance with eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
based on the terms and conditions of the product arrangements  we have concluded that these services and undelivered products can be accounted for separately from the delivered product element as our delivered product has value to our customers on a stand alone basis and we have objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of such services and undelivered products 
accordingly  service revenue representing the fair value of services not yet performed at the time of product shipment is deferred and recognized as such services are performed 
the fair value of the undelivered products is also deferred at the time of product shipment and recognized when these products are delivered 
the residual revenue under the product arrangement will be recognized as product revenue upon shipment 
there are no customer right of return in our sales agreements 
we recognize product revenue upon the completion of installation for products whose installation is essential to its functionality  primarily related to our digital imaging systems 
a provision is made at that time for estimated warranty costs to be incurred 
service revenues primarily consist of amounts recorded under service and maintenance contracts and repairs not covered under warranty  installation and training revenues and shipping and handling costs billed to customers 
service and maintenance contract revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
other service revenues are recorded when the services are delivered 
although our products contain operating and application software  we have determined that for all of our products  except for those recently obtained with the acquisition of r technology  inc  the software element is incidental in accordance with aicpa sop  software revenue recognition  sop and eitf issue no 
 applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software 
we have determined that the provisions of sop apply to revenue transactions for those cad products recently acquired from r technology  inc sop no 
 as amended  generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
revenue recognized from multi element arrangements is allocated to each element of the arrangement using the residual method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements 
our determination of fair value of the undelivered elements in the multi element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management  having the relevant authority to do so for an element not yet sold separately 
the company recognizes revenue on cad product sales upon completion of installation at which time the only remaining undelivered element is post contract support 

table of contents the company recognizes revenues from maintenance services ratably over the term of the maintenance contract period based on vsoe of fair value 
vsoe of fair value is based upon the amount charged for maintenance when purchased separately  which is typically the contract s renewal rate 
maintenance services are typically stated separately in an arrangement 
the allocated fair value of revenues pertaining to contractual maintenance obligations are classified as a current liability  since they are typically for the twelve month period subsequent to the balance sheet date 
for multi element arrangements where vsoe of fair value for post contract support has not been established  we would recognize revenue ratably over the contractual term of the support 
for multi element arrangements where vsoe of fair value of post contract support has been established  we recognize revenue using the residual method at the time all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
amounts attributable to post contract support are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the contractual term of the support 
in accordance with the eitf issue no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees  the company classifies the reimbursement by customers of shipping and handling costs as revenue and the associated cost as cost of revenue 
the company also records reimbursable out of pocket expenses in both maintenance and services revenues and as a direct cost of maintenance and service in accordance with eitf issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred eitf 
for the fiscal   and  shipping and handling costs and reimbursable out of pocket expenses were not material 
product warranties products sold are generally covered by a warranty for a period of one year 
we accrue a warranty reserve at the time of revenue recognition for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased or decreased warranty claim activity or increased or decreased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty accrual will increase or decrease  respectively  resulting in decreased or increased gross profit 
our warranty accrual was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in the warranty accrual in fiscal is primarily attributable to the increase in the number of digital mammography systems sold 
the increase in the warranty accrual in fiscal is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of digital mammography systems sold as well  of acquired reserve amounts as a result of our acquisitions in fiscal stock based compensation on december  the fasb issued sfas statement no 
r sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas statement no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach under sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted for fiscal years starting after june  as a result  we have adopted sfas r starting in our fiscal first quarter of  which began on september  as permitted by sfas  we historically accounted for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
we have adopted the modified prospective method alternative outlined in sfas r 
a modified prospective method is one in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r 
table of contents that remain unvested on the effective date 
as a result  we are amortizing the unamortized stock based compensation expense related to unvested option grants issued prior to the adoption of sfas r  whose fair value was calculated utilizing a black scholes option pricing model 
for options granted after our adoption of sfas r  we have elected to use a bi nomial model to determine the weighted average fair value of options  rather than the black scholes model  which we had previously used 
in addition  sfas r requires companies to utilize an estimated forfeiture rate when calculating the expense for the period  whereas  sfas permitted companies to record forfeitures based on actual forfeitures  which was our historical policy under sfas as a result  we have applied an estimated forfeiture rate of in fiscal and a range between and in fiscal  for stock option awards  in determining the expense recorded in our consolidated statement of income 
for further information regarding the assumptions we used in determining our stock based compensation expense  see note to our financial statements 
during the year ended september  we recorded million of stock based compensation expense for employee equity awards 
the stock based compensation expense for employee equity awards included  in cost of revenues   in research and development   in selling and marketing and million in general and administrative expense for the year ended september  the compensation expense reduced both basic earnings per share by and diluted earnings per share by 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method of sfas r  results for prior periods have not been restated 
as of september   there was million of unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested market based stock option awards that we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years 
as of september   there was million of unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested restricted stock units that we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years income taxes we account for income taxes under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences and carry forwards to the extent they are realizable 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
in fiscal  we recorded approximately million of tax benefit associated with deductions generated by excess stock based compensation deductions expected to be utilized on our fiscal us tax return 
this full amount was recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital 
additionally  we recorded a decrease of approximately  to our valuation allowance against certain federal and state net operating losses acquired in the suros and r acquisitions with a corresponding reduction to goodwill 
the remaining change in valuation allowance is attributable to the decrease in valuation allowance on certain state tax assets generated through we believe it is more likely than not that these state tax assets will be realized 
we establish tax reserves based on our assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences and tax credits 
these tax reserves are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustment to the reserve 
based on the annual evaluations of tax positions  we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures 
to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we received notification that the joint committee on taxation had no exceptions with the internal revenue service s conclusions on several tax returns under examination 
therefore  we released  of tax reserves related to these returns further reducing our effective tax rate for fiscal 
table of contents legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
in connection with these legal proceedings  management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by us in connection with the adjudication or settlement  if any  of these proceedings 
these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  loss contingencies are accrued if  in the opinion of management  an adverse outcome is probable and such outcome can be reasonably estimated 
we do not believe that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  however  it is possible that future results for any particular quarter or annual period may be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings 
overview we are a diversified medical technologies company specializing in diagnostic imaging products and interventional devices dedicated to serving the healthcare needs of women 
historically  we have developed  manufactured and marketed products focused on mammography  breast care and osteoporosis assessment 
in october  we completed our business combination with cytyc  a company that develops  manufactures and markets a complementary product line covering a range of cancers and women s health indications  including cervical cancer screening  prenatal diagnostics and partial breast radiation therapy 
as a result of our business combination with cytyc  we have become one of the largest companies in the world focused on creating innovative and clinically effective advanced technologies in women s health 
our mammography breast care products include a broad product line of breast imaging and related products  including film based and digital mammography systems  computer aided detection cad  breast biopsy systems and mammopad breast cushions 
these products are inclusive of those acquired from r and suros in fiscal and biolucent in fiscal beginning in fiscal  we have combined our digital detector business with our mammography operating segment to better reflect how we view our operations and manage our business 
our digital detector products are a digital component for our digital mammography equipment and  to a much lesser extent  are a digital component for original equipment manufacturers to incorporate into their own equipment 
our osteoporosis assessment products primarily consist of dual energy x ray bone densitometry systems and  to a lesser extent  an ultrasound based osteoporosis assessment product 
our other business segment includes our mini c arm  extremity mri  conventional general radiography service  digital general radiography systems and aeg photoconductor materials businesses 
in fiscal we expect that our reporting segments will be reconfigured to reflect the inclusion of cytyc and the integration of our combined businesses 
acquisitions fiscal acquisition cytyc corporation on october  we completed the merger with cytyc corporation cytyc pursuant to agreement and plan of merger merger agreement entered into on may  the merger 
under the terms and conditions of the merger agreement  at the effective time of the merger  each share of common stock of cytyc  issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing was cancelled and converted into the right to receive i shares of common stock of hologic and ii in cash 
the purchase price for the transaction  exclusive of certain merger related costs and expenses  in the aggregate is approximately billion 
as of september   we capitalized a total of million of direct acquisitions costs  which are included in other long term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
cytyc  headquartered in marlborough  massachusetts  is a diversified diagnostic and medical device company that designs  develops  manufactures  and markets innovative and clinically effective diagnostic and 
table of contents surgical products 
cytyc products cover a range of cancer and women s health applications  including cervical cancer screening  treatment of excessive menstrual bleeding  radiation treatment of early stage breast cancer  and the assessment of the risk of pre term birth 
under the merger agreement  cytyc shareholders received an aggregate of approximately  shares of hologic common stock and approximately billion in cash  assuming the conversion of all cytyc s outstanding convertible notes 
through october   million of the million convertible notes had been converted into cash and hologic s common stock with million remaining 
we expect substantially all of the remainder to convert by the end of our first quarter of fiscal in connection with the merger  we entered into a credit agreement relating to a senior secured credit facility credit agreement with goldman sachs credit partners lp and certain other lenders  in which the lenders committed to provide  in the aggregate  senior secured financing of up to approximately billion to pay for the cash portion of the merger consideration  for repayment of existing debt of cytyc  for expenses relating to the merger and for working capital following the completion of the merger 
as of the closing of the merger we borrowed billion under the credit facility 
the estimated aggregate purchase price of approximately billion includes billion in cash   shares of hologic common stock at an estimated fair value of billion  approximately million of fully vested stock options granted to cytyc employees at an estimated fair value of approximately million  and approximately million of direct acquisition costs 
there are no potential contingent consideration payable to the former cytyc shareholders in connection with this transaction 
our business combination with cytyc will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in accordance with sfas  we are considered to be the acquirer of cytyc for accounting purposes 
this means that the total purchase price will be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from cytyc based on our estimate of their fair values as of the date of the completion of the merger  and any excess of purchase price over those fair values will be recorded as goodwill 
cytyc s revenues and operating income for the nine months ended september  were million  and million  respectively  and for its fiscal year ended december  were million  and million  respectively 
cytyc s results for the nine months ended september  included charges of approximately million related to a litigation settlement and costs associated with our business combination 
during the nine months ended september   cytyc s net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million 
during this period  changes in cytyc s assets and liabilities  excluding the effects of acquisitions  used million of cash  including an increase in accounts receivable of million and a decrease in accrued expenses of million 
our reported financial condition and results of operations issued for periods ending after completion of the merger will reflect the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed and results of operations after completion of the merger  but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of cytyc 
following the completion of the merger  our earnings will also reflect purchase accounting adjustments  such as increased amortization and other expense for the acquired tangible and intangible assets of cytyc  as well as the interest on the funds we borrowed to complete the merger 
more detailed information concerning our preliminary estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the cytyc merger  as well as supplemental pro forma information relating to that merger  is set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements 
fiscal acquisition biolucent  inc on september  we completed the acquisition of biolucent  inc biolucent pursuant to a definitive agreement dated june  the results of operations for biolucent have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition as part of its mammography breastcare business segment 

table of contents biolucent  previously located in aliso viejo  california  develops  markets and sells the mammopad breast cushion  to decrease the discomfort associated with mammography 
biolucent s primary research and development efforts are directed at its brachytherapy business which is focused on breast cancer therapy 
prior to the acquisition  biolucent spun off its brachytherapy technology and business to the holders of biolucent s outstanding shares of capital stock 
as a result we only acquired biolucent s mammopad business and related assets 
we invested million directly in the spun off brachytherapy business in exchange for shares of preferred stock issued by the new business  representing less than ownership 
the aggregate purchase price for biolucent was approximately million consisting of approximately million in cash and  shares of hologic common stock valued at approximately million  repayment of outstanding debt of biolucent of approximately million and approximately million for acquisition related fees and expenses 
the company determined the fair value of the shares issued in connection with the acquisition in accordance with eitf issue no 
 determination of the measurement date for the market price of acquirer securities issued in a purchase business combination 
the acquisition also provides for up to two annual earn out payments not to exceed million in the aggregate based on biolucent s achievement of certain revenue targets 
we have considered the provision of eitf issue no 
 accounting for contingent consideration paid to the shareholders of and acquired enterprise in a purchase business combination  and concluded that this contingent consideration represents additional purchase price 
as a result  goodwill will be increased by the amount of the additional consideration  if any  when it becomes due and payable 
the final purchase allocations will be completed within one year of the acquisition and any adjustments are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
fiscal acquisitions fischer imaging on september   we acquired intellectual property relating to fischer imaging corporation s mammography business and products  including the intellectual property relating to its mammotest prone breast biopsy and senoscan digital mammography systems 
the purchase price for the intellectual property was million  approximately million of which was paid out of existing cash with the remaining amount paid through the cancellation of the principal and interest outstanding under a million secured loan we previously provided to fischer imaging on june  we incurred a charge of approximately million to write off in process research and development in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the ftc investigation in the fourth quarter of  we sold  to siemens ag for a cash payment of million  all of the intellectual property we acquired from fischer relating to the mammotest system  subject to our retention of a royalty free  non exclusive  perpetual  irrevocable  worldwide right and license to use that intellectual property 
in connection with this sale we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million and a resulting net gain of approximately million from the proceeds on the sale during the fourth quarter of fiscal aeg elektrofotografie on may   we acquired aeg elektrofotografie and its group of related companies 
aeg was a privately held group of companies headquartered in warstein  germany  with manufacturing operations in germany  china and us aeg specializes in the manufacture of photoconductor materials for use in a variety of electro photographic applications  including for the coating of our digital detectors 
the acquisition of aeg allows us to have control over this critical step in our detector manufacturing process  which should allow us to more efficiently manage our supply chain and improve manufacturing margins 
our acquisition of aeg should also facilitate further manufacturing efficiencies and accelerate research and development of new detector products 
the results of aeg operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition and is a component of our other business segment 

table of contents the aggregate purchase price for aeg was approximately million subject to adjustment consisting of eur and  shares of our common stock valued at million  and approximately million for acquisition related fees and expenses 
the acquisition also provided for a one year earn out of eur million approximately million usd which was payable in cash if aeg calendar year earnings  as defined  exceeded a pre determined amount 
aeg s earnings did not exceed such pre determined amount and no payment was made 
we finalized and implemented a plan to restructure certain of aeg s historical activities 
we recorded a liability of approximately million in accordance with eitf issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination  related to the termination of certain employees under this plan and all amounts have been paid as of september  as part of the purchase price allocation  all intangible assets that were a part of the acquisition were identified and valued 
it was determined that only customer lists  tradenames  developed technology and in process research and development had separately identifiable values 
the fair value of these intangible assets was determined through the application of the income approach 
customer lists represent customer relationships as aeg has a high dependency on a small number of large accounts 
aeg markets its products through distributors as well as directly to its own customers 
trademarks represent the aeg product names that the we intend to continue to use 
developed technology represents currently marketable purchased products that the we will continue to resell as well as utilize to enhance and incorporate into our existing products 
the intangible assets are expected to be amortized on a straight line basis over the expected useful lives as the anticipated undiscounted cash flows are relatively consistent over the expected useful lives of the intangible assets

years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount product sales mammography breast care osteoporosis assessment other in fiscal our product sales increased compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in revenues from our mammography breast care products  led by an increase in the number of selenia digital mammography systems sold  and to a lesser extent  increased breast biopsy sales from suros  acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal also contributing to the increase was an increase in our other product sales  primarily attributable to the inclusion for the full year of sales from aeg  acquired during the third quarter of fiscal and an increase in sales of mini c arm systems 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in osteoporosis assessment sales in fiscal 
table of contents mammography breast care product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a million increase in digital mammography system sales  an increase of million in breast biopsy device sales from suros and a million increase in cad product sales from r suros and r are entities we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal prior to our acquisition of r we had sold cad products together with our digital mammography systems  primarily from r as a distributor 
the increase in cad product sales represents the additional cad sales made without our digital mammography systems 
these increases were partially offset by an million decrease in multicare stereotactic table sales and an million decrease in analog mammography systems sales 
the increase in our digital mammography product sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of selenia systems and related components sold  primarily in the united states 
in fiscal  we sold  digital mammography systems compared to systems in fiscal this revenue was partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices primarily attributable to increased competition  higher dealer sales  changes in product configuration and increased multi system sales 
we attribute the increase in digital mammography system sales primarily to the growing acceptance of our selenia mammography system and of digital mammography in general 
the decrease in multicare stereotactic tables was primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of systems sold worldwide in the current fiscal year compared to fiscal due in part to higher demand in related to increased sales activity following our acquisition of fischer s mammography intellectual property in september and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in average selling prices primarily in the united states 
the decrease in sales of our analog mammography systems was primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of systems sold worldwide and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in average selling prices 
we believe that this decrease in analog system sales was primarily due to the shift in product sales to digital systems 
we expect sales for analog systems to continue to decrease in fiscal osteoporosis assessment product sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in product sales in the united states primarily due to a decrease in the number of bone densitometry systems sold and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in the average selling prices 
we believe this decrease in our domestic unit sales reflect a decline in market conditions due to a reduction in reimbursement for osteoporosis assessment exams 
other product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to the addition of million of sales from aeg  acquired during the third quarter of fiscal  and an million increase in our mini c arm system sales 
the increase in mini c arm revenue is primarily the result of an increase in the number of systems sold in the united states and europe 
in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia  and in other international markets 
in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia  and in other international markets 
we believe the higher growth in sales dollars to the united states market is primarily due to an increase in demand for our selenia digital mammography system as adoption of digital mammography is occurring at an increased rate in the united states as compared to international markets

table of contents of million from an increase in the number of service contracts sold and  to a lesser extent  an increase of million in training revenues in our mammography breast care segment 
we believe that these increases reflect the continued growth in our installed base of products  especially selenia  and from the addition of service and other revenues from r and suros which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal cost of product sales 
years ended september  september  change amount of product sales amount of product sales amount cost of product sales cost of product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  in absolute dollars  primarily due to the increased product sales discussed above 
cost of product sales decreased as a percentage of product sales to in fiscal from in fiscal these costs decreased as a percentage of product sales primarily due to increased revenues and improved profitability associated with the shift in mammography product sales to selenia and  to a lesser extent  the lower cost of cad as a result of our acquisition of r the selenia systems have significantly higher selling prices  more than offsetting the higher costs of the product  when compared to analog mammography 
in addition  fiscal includes results of the recently acquired r and suros product lines for the entire year which have lower costs as a percentage of sales 
our higher selenia sales resulted in an improved absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
these improvements were partially offset by fewer bone densitometry systems sold  primarily in the united states  which negatively impacted the absorption of fixed overhead and a reduction in the average selling prices for these systems 
fiscal includes million of additional costs related to the sales of acquired aeg  r and suros inventory that was written up to fair value for purchase accounting purposes as of the date of each acquisition 
cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets 
years ended september  september  change amount of product sales amount of product sales amount cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets costs of product sales amortization of intangible assets increased primarily due to the increase in acquired intangible assets as a result of the acquisitions of aeg  r  suros and the intangible assets acquired from fischer imaging during fiscal  as well as  the acquisition of biolucent in fiscal the underlying intangible assets substantially relate to acquired developed technology and know how

cost of service and other revenue 
years ended september  september  change amount of service and other revenue amount of service and other revenue amount cost of service and other revenue 
table of contents cost of service and other revenue increased in absolute dollars primarily related to additional personnel and other costs to expand our service capabilities  especially in the united states  to support our growing installed base of products and increased warranty costs 
we expect our costs of service and other revenue to remain relatively high as a percentage of service and other revenue  reflecting our need to employ the required personnel for warranty  non warranty and installation activities to service our growing installed base of products 
we also expect a continued increase in customers entering into service agreements in connection with our transition to digital mammography and direct service coverage

this represented our normalized rate of approximately reduced by certain tax credits 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was of pre tax earnings 
this represents our normalized rate of approximately increased for the in process research and development charges recorded during the year which are not deductible for tax purposes 
we anticipate an effective tax rate of of pre tax earnings in fiscal segment results of operations beginning in fiscal  we combined our previously reported mammography and digital detector operating segments  to better reflect how we view our operations and manage our business 
in prior years  we offered directray digital detectors in hologic designed  manufactured  installed and serviced general radiography systems and also sold panels to original equipment manufacturers oems  to incorporate into their own equipment 
in fiscal we moved away from selling systems and panels for general radiography use and began to shift resources to our core women s health products mammography systems 
in january we ceased sales of digital systems for general radiography  and on october  we ceased manufacture of general radiography panels 
as a result the primary function of the digital detector business is to support our mammography product line 
we now report our business as three segments mammography breast care  osteoporosis assessment and other 
the operating results of our fiscal acquisition of the aeg photoconductor business is included in our other business segment 
the operating results of our fiscal acquisitions of r and suros and our fiscal acquisition of biolucent are included in mammography breast care 
prior periods have been restated to conform to this presentation 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we measure segment performance based on total revenues and operating income or loss 
revenues from product sales of each of these segments are described in further detail above 
the discussion that follows is a summary analysis of total revenues and the primary changes in operating income or loss by segment 
mammography breast care 
years ended september  september  change amount of total segment revenue amount of total segment revenue amount total revenues operating income mammography breast care revenues  as discussed above  increased primarily due to the million increase in product sales and an increase of million in service and other revenues primarily related to the increased number of systems in our installed base 
operating income for this business segment increased primarily due to the increased revenues 
our gross margin in this business segment increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal in fiscal our gross margins improved from the increase in product revenues of our more profitable selenia systems versus our analog mammography systems as well as a full year of higher margin product sales from the recently acquired businesses of r and suros 
in addition  higher total revenues including higher selenia sales have allowed for the greater absorption of manufacturing costs 
this improvement in the gross margin was offset in part by an increase in service related costs due to an increase in the number of our service personnel and an increase in warranty costs in the current fiscal year 
operating expenses for this business segment increased in fiscal primarily due to increased operating expenses in 
table of contents support of our growing selenia business  in particular increased selling expenses primarily due to the higher revenues  and as a result of the suros acquisition and  to a lesser extent  the r acquisition 
also contributing to the increase was an increase in intangible amortization of million  as well as an increase in stock based compensation of million 
fiscal included million of charges for acquired in process research and development related to our acquisitions 
these increased expenses in fiscal were partially offset in part by a net gain of million from our sale of mammotest intellectual property to siemens 
osteoporosis assessment 
years ended september  september  change amount of total segment revenue amount of total segment revenue amount total revenues operating income osteoporosis assessment revenues decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the million decrease in product sales discussed above and an  decrease in service revenues 
the decrease in service revenues was primarily due to a decrease in training revenues 
operating income for osteoporosis assessment decreased primarily from the decrease in product sales partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses 
our gross margin in this business segment was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in osteoporosis assessment gross margin reflects the decrease in product sales and the lower average selling prices 
operating income partially benefited from lower overhead allocations as there were higher allocations of overhead in the current year to the mammography breast care business segment reflecting the recent acquisitions and higher growth of that segment

also contributing to the increase was an increase in mini c arm sales of million 
the increase in operating income was due primarily to the operating income from aeg and  to a lesser extent  from the mini c arm business partially offset by a million extremity mri inventory write down and insufficient revenue volume for the third party extremity mri systems to cover the fixed costs  primarily headcount related  to support the distribution of these systems

osteoporosis sales also increased  to a lesser extent  in fiscal mammography breast care product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a million increase in digital mammography system sales  a million increase in multicare stereotactic table sales and million of product sales from r and suros  entities acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in analog mammography systems sales 
the increase in our digital mammography product sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of selenia systems sold worldwide 
in fiscal  we sold digital mammography systems compared to systems in fiscal we attribute the increase in digital mammography system sales primarily to the growing acceptance of our selenia mammography system and of digital mammography in general 
the increase in multicare stereotactic tables was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of systems sold worldwide in the current fiscal year compared to fiscal we attribute this increase at least in part  to our acquisition of the mammotest intellectual property from fischer 
the decrease in sales of our analog mammography systems was primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of systems sold both domestically and in europe  partially offset by an increase in units sold in other international markets combined with a decrease in average selling price in all markets 
we believe that this decrease in analog system sales was primarily due to the shift in product sales to digital systems 
osteoporosis assessment product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of systems sold in the united states and an increase in the number of our lower priced explorer bone densitometry systems sold internationally  that was offset in part by a slight decrease in the average selling prices 
other product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to the addition of million of sales from aeg  acquired during the third quarter of fiscal  million of sales from a new line of third party extremity mri systems and  to a lesser extent  a  increase in our mini c arm system sales

the selenia systems have significantly higher selling prices  more than offsetting the higher costs of the product  when compared to analog mammography 
in addition  the fourth quarter of fiscal includes the addition of the recently acquired r and suros product lines which have lower costs as a percentage of sales 
our higher selenia sales combined with the increase in revenues for the multicare stereotactic tables also resulted in an improved absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
offsetting these improvements was an increase in costs as a percentage of sales in our other segment due to the combination of aeg photoconductor sales  which earn a substantially lower margin as compared to our core product lines  and higher costs associated with the new mini c arm insight product

cytyc entered into a lease agreement on april  for a new manufacturing and office facility located in alajuela  costa rica costa rica lease 
the lease term will commence on or around february and

future minimum payments  including principal and interest  under these leases agreement were as follows at september  payments due by period total interest total with interest fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter costa rica lease marlborough lease in connection with the cytyc merger  we assumed the obligations under cytyc s senior convertible notes due the cytyc notes and the indenture entered into on march  by cytyc and us bank trust national association  as trustee thereunder the trustee  pursuant to which the cytyc notes were issued the indenture 
as of october   cytyc notes in the approximate principal face amount of  were outstanding 
interest on the cytyc notes is payable semi annually and the cytyc notes were previously convertible into shares of cytyc common stock 
at the effective time of the merger  we entered into a supplemental indenture with the trustee the supplemental indenture as required by the indenture in order to provide that we  as the successor to cytyc  assumed the obligations of cytyc under the cytyc notes and the indenture  and as a result of the merger  the cytyc notes ceased to be convertible into shares of cytyc common stock but rather became convertible into the kind and amount of shares of stock which a holder of shares of cytyc common stock would have been entitled to receive upon the merger had the cytyc notes been converted into shares of our common stock immediately prior to the merger  such that each  principal face amount of cytyc notes may be converted at any time and from time to time into in cash and shares of our common stock

our obligations under the cytyc notes and the indenture may be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain customary events of default including  without limitation  payment defaults  uncured defaults in the performance of certain covenants and agreements under the indenture and bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial account standards board fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to sfas no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes 
this includes tax positions considered to be routine as well as those with a high degree of uncertainty 
fin utilizes a two step approach for evaluating tax positions 
recognition step one occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step two is only addressed if step one has been satisfied ie  the position is more likely than not to be sustained 
under step two  the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit  determined on a cumulative probability basis 
table of contents that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin s use of the term more likely than not in steps one and two is consistent with how that term is used in sfas ie  a likelihood of occurrence greater than percent 
those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first subsequent interim period they meet the more likely than not standard  or are resolved through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority  or upon expiration of the statue of limitations 
derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when a company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained 
fin specifically prohibits the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions 
in addition  fin will require expanded disclosure requirements  which include a tabular rollforward of the beginning and ending aggregate unrecognized tax benefits as well as specific detail related to tax uncertainties for which it is reasonably possible the amount of unrecognized tax benefit will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months 
these disclosures are required at each annual reporting period unless a significant change occurs in an interim period 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we expect to adopt fin in our first quarter of fiscal  which begins on september  differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of fin and the amounts reported after adoption should be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
the cumulative effect adjustment would not apply to those items that would not have been recognized in earnings  such as the effect of adopting fin on tax positions related to business combinations 
we believe the adoption will not have a material impact on our results of operation or financial position 
on september   the sec staff published sab no 
sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab addresses quantifying the financial statement effects of misstatements  specifically  how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements 
sab does not change the sec staff s previous positions in sab  materiality  regarding qualitative considerations in assessing the materiality of misstatements 
sab acknowledges the existing diversity in practice in this area and discusses techniques commonly used to accumulate and quantify misstatements 
the rollover method used by some companies and auditors quantifies a misstatement based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the current period income statement 
the iron curtain method quantifies a misstatement based on the effects of correcting the misstatement in the balance sheet at the end of the current period  regardless of the misstatement s period of origin 
the sec staff does not believe exclusive reliance on one method biased toward either the income statement of the balance sheet is appropriate 
the staff believes that registrants and auditors must quantify the effects on the current year financial statements of correcting all misstatements  including both carryover and reversing effects of uncorrected prior year misstatements 
after considering all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors  if either approach results in a misstatement that is material  a registrant s financial statements must be adjusted 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november   which is our year ending september  the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
on september   the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
sfas does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early 
table of contents adoption is not permitted 
therefore  we will adopt sfas in fiscal  which commences on september  we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which allows an entity to elect to record financial assets and liabilities at fair value upon their initial recognition on a contract by contract basis 
subsequent changes in fair value would be recognized in earnings as the changes occur 
statement no 
also establishes additional disclosure requirements for these items stated at fair value 
statement no 
is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november   which is our fiscal year  with early adoption permitted  provided that we also adopt statement no

we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of statement no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements

 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
the scope of this consensus includes any taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include  but are not limited to  sales  use  value added  and some excise taxes 
per the consensus  the presentation of these taxes on either a gross included in revenues and costs or a net excluded from revenues basis is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed 
we present sales net of sales taxes in our consolidated statements of income 
issue no 
is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  no change of presentation has resulted from our adoption of issue no 
in july  the fasb ratified eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
the scope of this consensus includes nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized 
the capitalized amounts should be expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed 
if an entity s expectations change such that it does not expect it will need the goods to be delivered or the services to be rendered  capitalized nonrefundable advance payments should be charged to expense 
issue no 
is effective for new contract entered into during fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years 
the consensus may not be applied to earlier periods 
early adoption of the provisions is not permitted 
our historical policy has been to capitalize upfront nonrefundable advance payments related to research and development activities and expense these amounts as the goods are delivered or services rendered 
therefore  the adoption of this consensus is not expected to have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments 
sfas no 
 disclosure of fair value of financial instruments  requires disclosure about fair value of financial instruments 
financial instruments consist of cash equivalents  short and long term investments  accounts receivable  and debt obligations 
the fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying amount 
primary market risk exposures 
our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in fiscal  we incurred interest expense on borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement with bank of america and on the debt assumed as a result of our acquisition of aeg 
at september   there were no amounts outstanding under the bank of america credit agreement  and in connection with the credit agreement we entered into on october   the bank of america credit agreement was terminated 
as of the closing of the cytyc merger  we borrowed billion under our october  credit agreement all of which carries variable interest rates 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a 
table of contents rate per annum equal to  at our option  either the base rate the greater of the prime rate as quoted in the wall street journal and the federal funds effective rate plus or the eurodollar rate  plus an applicable margin determined by reference to the leverage ratio  as set forth in the credit agreement 
as of october  all amounts outstanding accrued interest at the eurodollar rate with applicable margins ranging from to 
each basis point change in interest rates would result in approximately million change in annual interest expense based on amounts currently outstanding 
the terms of the credit agreement obligate us to enter into hedging transactions by april to hedge the interest rate risk of at least of the indebtedness under the credit agreement if we do not otherwise refinance such portion of the indebtedness with debt financing bearing a fixed rate of interest 
the terms of the aeg debt agreements have various maturities ranging from december  through september  interest rates are variable and at september  ranged from to 
we may also incur interest expense on loans made under a european line of credit that accrues interest at the europe interbank offered rate plus to  as defined 
at september   there were no amounts outstanding under the european line of credit 
we terminated interest rate swap contracts  totalling million euros and million us dollars  where we paid a fixed rate and received at a floating rate  in the fourth quarter of fiscal the termination resulted in a gain of  investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that experience a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in investment interest rates  however  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
interest income on our investments is recorded as a component of other income in our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency exchange risk 
our international business is subject to risks  including  but not limited to unique economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
we maintain sales and service offices outside the united states  have manufacturing facilities in germany  costa rica and china  and conduct business worldwide 
the expenses of our international offices are denominated in local currencies  except at our costa rica subsidiary  where the majority of the business is conducted in us dollars 
our foreign sales are denominated in local currencies  the euro or us dollars 
fluctuations in the foreign currency rates could affect our cost of goods and operating margins and could result in exchange losses 
in addition  currency devaluations can result in a loss if we hold deposits of that currency 
we believe that the operating expenses of our international subsidiaries that are incurred in local currencies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our operating results and certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in the euro are affected by changes in the relative strength of the us dollar against the euro 
our expenses are positively affected when the united states dollar strengthens against the euro and adversely affected when the united states dollar weakens 
however  we believe that the foreign currency exchange risk is not significant 
during fiscal   and  we incurred foreign currency exchange gains losses of   and  respectively 
we occasionally use forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate exposures related to our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  and more specifically  to hedge  on a net basis  the foreign currency exposure of a portion of our german sales denominated in the us dollar 
the 
table of contents terms of these forward contracts are generally of a short term nature months 
at september   we had no outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts
