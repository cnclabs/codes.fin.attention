item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its investment portfolio 
the company mitigates its risk by diversifying its investments among securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company does not hedge any interest rate exposures 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
foreign currency risk 
the majority of our foreign currency transactions are denominated in the yen or the euro  which are the functional currencies of japan and europe  respectively 
as a result of transactions being denominated and settled in such functional currencies  the risks associated with currency fluctuations are primarily associated with foreign currency translation adjustments 
we do not currently hedge against foreign currency translation risks and do not currently believe that foreign currency exchange risk is significant to our operations due to the short term nature of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
the average foreign exchange rates used to translate the  and statements of operations were as follows fiscal year ended fiscal year ended fiscal year ended foreign currency april  april  april  yen euro
