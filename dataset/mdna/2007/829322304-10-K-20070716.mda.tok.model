item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes filed herewith 
our fiscal year ends march this document contains certain forward looking statements including  among others  regarding anticipated trends in our financial condition and results of operations and our business strategy 
see part i  item a  risk factors 
these forward looking statements are based largely on our current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements 
important factors to consider in evaluating such forward looking statements include i changes in external factors or in our internal budgeting process which might impact trends in our results of operations  ii unanticipated working capital or other cash requirements  iii changes in our business strategy or an inability to execute our strategy due to unanticipated changes in the industries in which we operate  and iv various competitive market factors that may prevent us from competing successfully in the marketplace 
overview our primary objectives for fiscal were to restructure our hong kong operation and spin off the hong kong subsidiary  raise additional capital  establish the macau operation  continue to drive down the operating costs  expand our business into other product categories 
we believe that the plans were well executed and we have achieved our primary goals 
we have sold our former hong kong subsidiary along with the potential tax liability of approximately million 
the monthly operation cost in asia has been reduced by by outsourcing the engineering and shipping services to starlight international  the parent of our majority shareholder 
our gross profit margin increased by in fiscal compared to prior year and our general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  a decrease of million or compared to prior year 
the decrease of fixed operating expenses was primarily due to the improvement of the employees productivity and the reduction of major expenses in various categories 
even though our revenues have decreased from  to  a decrease of  or  our loss from operations decreased from  to  a decrease of  or 
our net income for fiscal is  as compared with a loss of  in fiscal we have entered into two licensing agreements with mga entertainment to produce the karaoke and youth electronics products under the bratz license and have developed over models 
the additional revenues from bratz products in fiscal are estimated at to of total revenues in fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of the company s total revenues total revenues cost of sales operating expenses operating loss income other expenses  income  net loss before taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss fiscal year ended march  compared with fiscal year ended march net sales net sales for the fiscal year ended march  were approximately million  a decrease of approximately million from approximately million for fiscal the decrease in net sales was a result of both decreases in unit volume as well as pricing 
the decrease in sales is primarily attributed to the following we lost a million order from a major specialty store in the united states because the customer decided not to carry karaoke products 
also  one of our european customers had carried over inventory from fiscal and therefore they lowered their fiscal purchases by million 
we did not complete the investment transaction with koncept international until june most of major retailers had decided their buying plan before june 
our financial constraints affect our ability to compete for the major accounts 
the decrease of karaoke compact disc cd sales 
we had higher than usual returns of karaoke cd s in our quarter ended march  as a result  our music sales decreased by approximately  to approximately million for fiscal the music industry has been experiencing a continuing decline in cd sales  while the music download business has increased dramatically 
we have explored the possibilities with various download companies to sell our music and lyrics on line in fiscal in fiscal year  of our sales were direct sales  which represent sales made by international smc and smc macau  and were domestic sales  which represents sales made from our warehouses in the united states 
the sales decrease occurred in all segments of our business 
our total hardware sales decreased to approximately million in fiscal compared to total hardware sales of approximately million in fiscal music sales decreased to approximately million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared to approximately million  or of net sales  in fiscal the decrease in music sales was a result of a sharp decline in overall cd sales as experienced by other major companies in the music industry 
gross profit gross profit for fiscal was approximately million or of total revenues compared to approximately million or of sales for fiscal the increase in gross margin  compared to the prior year  was primarily due to a better pricing model for hardware and the loss of the low margin customers 
the increase of the hardware profit margin was partly offset by the decrease of the music profit margin 
music sales yield higher profit margin than our other products 
our gross profit may not be comparable to those of other entities  since some entities include the costs of warehousing  inspection  freight charges and other distribution costs in their cost of sales 
we account for the above expenses as operating expenses and classify them under selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating expenses operating expenses  including depreciation and amortization  for the fiscal year ended march  decreased from approximately million to approximately million  a decrease of approximately million or compared to the same period last year 
the decrease in operating expenses consists of approximately  increase in selling expenses  which include advertising  commission  freight and royalty expenses  and an approximately million decrease in general and administration expenses 
the increase of selling expenses was primarily due to the increase of freight expenses of approximately  the decrease of the general and administrative expenses was primarily due to reductions in warehouse expenses  compensation expenses and the bad debt expense 
depreciation and amortization our depreciation and amortization expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal this decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses can be attributed to the fact that we produced fewer models with higher volume per model  which increased the economies of scale for our product lines 
in addition  the company did not amortize any loan costs for the fiscal year ended march  net other income expenses net other expense was  in fiscal compared to net other income of  in fiscal in fiscal  we recognized a one time gain of approximately million from the restructuring of approximately million convertible debts and we also incurred approximately million amortization of discount on convertible debentures 
in addition  we incurred approximately  in interest expense in fiscal our interest expense was approximately  for fiscal income before taxes we had a net loss before taxes of  in fiscal compared to a net loss before taxes of  in fiscal the decrease of the loss was primarily due to the decrease of the operating expenses 
income tax expense significant management judgment is required in developing our provisions for income taxes  including the determination of foreign tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against deferred tax assets 
management evaluates its ability to realize its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and adjusts its valuation allowance when it believes that it is not likely to be realized 
on march  and  we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million and approximately million  against which we recorded valuation allowances totaling approximately million and approximately  respectively 
for the fiscal years ended march  and march   we did not record any income tax expense 
this occurred because the company had taxable losses for the us operations and the macau subsidiary is exempt from income tax according to the macau offshore company moc regulations 
the company s former wholly owned subsidiary  international smc hk limited had applied for an exemption of income tax in hong kong 
therefore  no taxes had been expensed or provided for at international smc hk limited 
although no decision has been reached by the governing body  the parent company had reached the decision to provide for the possibility that the exemption could be denied and accordingly had recorded a provision of  in the consolidated financial statements for hong kong taxes in fiscal  and as a result of restructuring its operations in china  the company established a wholly owned macau subsidiary to conduct its operations in china 
in august  the company engaged the parent of its major shareholder in hong kong  starlight international  to provide engineering and shipping services 
in september  the company sold its wholly owned hong kong subsidiary  international smc hk limited ismc to see bright investments limited 
as a consequence of the ismc divestiture  and based on the opinion of the hong kong tax counsel  as well as hold harmless representations from the present shareholders of ismc  the company reversed the previously recorded provision of hong kong tax of approximately  in the quarter ended december  such reversal has been presented in the income tax section of the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in those jurisdictions 
because of the complex issues involved  any claims can require an extended period to resolve 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 
net loss net income as a result of the foregoing  we had net income of approximately  in fiscal compared to a net loss of approximately million in fiscal our decrease in net loss is primarily attributable to a one time tax reversal of approximately million 
fiscal year ended march  compared with fiscal year ended march net sales one of our primary goals in fiscal was to stabilize the revenues 
net sales for the fiscal year ended march  was approximately million  a decrease of approximately million from approximately million for fiscal the decrease in net sales was a result of both decreases in unit volume as well as pricing 
the decrease in sales is primarily attributed to customers concerned of our financial liquidity  most of the overstock inventory from prior years has been sold at a very lower price in fiscal and fiscal  which generated the higher revenues 
there were only approximately million of old inventory carried over to fiscal  increase of price competition in the united states and international market 
in fiscal year  of our sales were direct sales  which represent sales made by international smc  and were domestic sales  which represents sales made from our warehouse in the united states 
the sales decrease occurred in all segments of our business 
our total hardware sales decreased to approximately million  in fiscal compared to total hardware sales of approximately million in fiscal music sales decreased to approximately million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared to approximately million  or of net sales  in fiscal the decrease in music sales was a result of increased competition in this category 
gross profit gross profit for fiscal was approximately million or of total revenues compared to approximately million or of sales for fiscal the decrease in gross margin  compared to the prior year  was primarily due to increased price competition and the increase of factory labor and raw material cost 
the decrease of music sales also had negative effect on the gross margin since music sales yield higher profit margin than our other products 
our gross profit may not be comparable to those of other entities  since some entities include the costs of warehousing  inspection  freight charges and other distribution costs in their cost of sales 
we account for the above expenses as operating expenses and classify them under selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating expenses operating expenses for the fiscal year ended march  decreased from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million  a decrease of approximately million or compared to the same period last year 
the decrease in operating expenses consists of a million decrease in variable expenses advertising  commission  freight and royalty expenses and a  decrease in fixed expenses compensation and general and administration expenses 
the variable expenses were decreased proportionally as revenues decreased 
the fixed expense decrease of approximately  was primarily due to reductions in warehouse expenses and compensation expenses  which were partially off set by an increase of bad debts expense 
depreciation and amortization our depreciation and amortization expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal this decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses can be attributed to the fact that we produced fewer models with higher volume per model  which increased the economies of scale for our product lines 
net other income expenses net other income was  in fiscal compared to net other expenses of  in fiscal the decrease in net other expenses in fiscal was because we recognized approximately million on a one time gain from the restructuring of approximately million convertible debts and the decrease of interest expense of income before taxes we had a net loss before taxes of  in fiscal compared to a net loss before taxes of  in fiscal the decreased net loss was primarily due to approximately million gain from debt restructuring 
income tax expense significant management judgment is required in developing our provisions for income taxes  including the determination of foreign tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against deferred tax assets 
management evaluates its ability to realize its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and adjusts its valuation allowance when it believes that it is not likely to be realized 
on march  and  we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million and approximately million  against which we recorded valuation allowances totaling approximately million and approximately  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended march   we did not record income tax expense 
this occurred because the company had taxable losses for both us operations and hong kong operations 
our subsidiary has applied for an exemption of income tax in hong kong 
although no decision has been reached by the governing body  the parent company had decided to provide for the possibility that the exemption could be denied and accordingly has recorded a provision for hong kong taxes in fiscal and there was no provision for hong kong income taxes in fiscal and fiscal due to the subsidiary s taxable loss 
hong kong income taxes payable totaled approximately million at march  and and is included in the accompanying balance sheets as income taxes payable 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in those jurisdictions 
because of the complex issues involved  any claims can require an extended period to resolve 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 
net loss net income as a result of the foregoing  we had a net loss of approximately million in fiscal compared to a net loss of approximately million in fiscal our decrease in net loss is primarily attributable to million one time gain from the restructuring of the million convertible debentures 
liquidity and capital resources on march   we had cash on hand of approximately million compared to cash on hand of approximately  and restricted cash of approximately  on march  the increase of cash on hand was primarily due to the approximately million equity investments we received from investors in fiscal year cash used by operating activities was approximately million for the twelve months ended march  this was primarily due to a loss from operations of approximately million  payments to vendors for the old debt of approximately  and the settlement of customer credit balances of approximately  cash used in investing activities for the twelve months ended march  was approximately  cash used in investing activities was for the purchase of tooling and molds in the amount of  offset by the release of the restricted cash of  from a bank in hong kong 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for the fiscal year ended march   which was due to additional equity investments of approximately million 
as of march   our working capital was approximately million 
our current liabilities of approximately million include customer credit on account of approximately  the amount will be offset by future purchases or refund 
subordinate debt of approximately  this amount is payable on demand current liabilities resulting from normal course of the business of approximately million 
as of july   our cash on hand is approximately  our average monthly operating expenses are approximately  and we need approximately million to cover our operating expenses during the next three month period 
our primary expenses are normal operating costs including salaries  lease payments for our warehouse space in compton  california and other operating costs 
as of march   our commitments for debt and other contractual arrangements are summarized as follows total less than year years years over years property leases equipment leases subordinated debt related party licensing agreement interest payments total each of the contractual agreements except the equipment leases provides that all amounts due under that agreement can be accelerated if we default under the terms of the agreement 
working capital requirements during the short and long term during the next twelve month period  we plan on financing our working capital needs from equity investments the company is actively seeking equity investments to expand its business and to meet amex listing requirements 
we expect to raise million to million additional capital in fiscal vendor financing our key vendors in china have agreed to manufacture on behalf of the company without advanced payments and have extended payment terms to the company 
the terms with the factories are sufficient to cover the factory direct sales  which accounted for more than of the total revenues 
factoring of accounts receivable the company would factor its accounts receivable for sales originated in the united states 
we are currently exploring the possibilities with various banks 
we might need a higher credit facility to meet the cash requirements during the shipping season 
inventory financing the company expects to purchase more inventory for shipping to the united states this year in anticipation of the sales increase generated by the bratz product line 
our inventory level may be higher compared with fiscal we plan to obtain an asset based lending facility to cover the cash requirements of the inventory cost reduction the company has reduced significant operating expenses in recent years 
the cost reduction initiatives are part of our intensive effort to achieve a successful turn around restructuring 
the company plans to continue its cost cutting efforts in fiscal bridge loan we may be able to raise additional short term bridge loan from the parent of our majority shareholder  starlight international  who is also one of our suppliers 
our sources of cash for working capital in the long term are the same as our sources during the short term 
if we need additional financing  we intend to approach different financing companies or insiders 
however  we cannot guarantee that our financing plan will succeed 
if we need to obtain additional financing and fail to do so  it may have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial obligations and continue our operations 
during fiscal  we will strive to reduce additional operating costs 
in order to reduce the need to maintain inventory in our warehouses in california and florida  we intend to continue to ship a significant portion of our total sales directly from smc macau 
the goods shipped directly to our customers from ports in china are primarily backed by customer letters of credit 
the customers take title to the merchandise at their consolidators in china and are responsible for the shipment  duty  clearance and freight charges to their locations 
in order to keep our inventory low  we have been helping our customers forecast and manage their singing machine inventories 
this will prevent the overstocking situation with customers 
except for the foregoing  we do not have any present commitment that is likely to cause our liquidity to increase or decrease in any material way 
in addition  except for the company s need for additional capital to finance inventory purchases  the company is not aware of any trend  additional demand  event or uncertainty that will result in  or that is reasonably likely to result in  the company s liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way 
exchange rates we sell all of our products in us dollars and pay for all of our manufacturing costs in either us or hong kong dollars 
operating expenses of our former hong kong office were paid in hong kong dollars 
operating expenses of the macau office are paid in either hong kong dollars or macau currency mop the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar has been fixed by the hong kong government since at hk to us and  accordingly  has not represented a currency exchange risk to the us dollar 
the exchange rate of the mop to the us dollar is mop to us 
we cannot assure you that the exchange rate between the united states  macau and hong kong currencies will continue to be fixed or that exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
seasonal and quarterly results historically  our operations have been seasonal  with the highest net sales occurring in the second and third quarters reflecting increased orders for equipment and music merchandise during the christmas selling months and to a lesser extent the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year 
sales in our fiscal second and third quarter  combined  accounted for approximately  and of net sales in fiscal   and our results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the amount and timing of orders placed and shipped to customers  as well as other factors 
the fulfillment of orders can therefore significantly affect results of operations on a quarter to quarter basis 
we are currently developing and considering selling products other than karaoke category during the slow season to fulfill the revenue shortfall 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations 
the company has historically passed any price increases on to its customers since prices charged by the company are generally not fixed by long term contracts 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
critical accounting policies we prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results included accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves on inventory and income tax 
collectibility of accounts receivable 
the singing machine s allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s estimates of the creditworthiness of its customers  current economic conditions and historical information  and  in the opinion of management  is believed to be an amount sufficient to respond to normal business conditions 
management sets reserves for customers in bankruptcy and other reserves based upon historical collection experience 
should business conditions deteriorate or any major customer default on its obligations to the company  this allowance may need to be significantly increased  which would have a negative impact on operations 
reserves on inventories 
the singing machine establishes a reserve on inventory based on the expected net realizable value of inventory on an item by item basis when it is apparent that the expected realizable value of an inventory item falls below its original cost 
a charge to cost of sales results when the estimated net realizable value of specific inventory items declines below cost 
management regularly reviews the company s investment in inventories for such declines in value 
income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of foreign tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
management evaluates its ability to realize its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and adjusts its valuation allowance when it believes that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in those jurisdictions 
because of the complex issues involved  any claims can require an extended period to resolve 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for potential income taxes in the jurisdictions have been made 
other estimates 
we make other estimates in the ordinary course of business relating to sales returns and allowances  warranty reserves  and reserves for promotional incentives 
historically  past changes to these estimates have not had a material impact on our financial condition 
however  circumstances could change which may alter future expectations 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the attached financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states and international borrowing rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we are exposed to market risk in certain geographic areas that have experienced or remain vulnerable to an economic downturn  such as china 
we purchase substantially all our inventory from companies in china  and  therefore  we are subject to the risk that such suppliers will be unable to provide inventory at competitive prices 
while we believe that  if such an event were to occur we would be able to find alternative sources of inventory at competitive prices  we cannot assure you that we would be able to do so 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
historically and as of march   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities to minimize market risk 
interest rate risk as of march   our exposure to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates is immaterial 
foreign currency risk we have a wholly owned subsidiary in macau 
sales by this operation made on a fob china or hong kong basis are dominated in us dollars 
however  purchases of inventory and macau operating expenses are typically denominated in either hong kong dollars or the macau currency mop  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
changes in the hong kong dollar  us dollar or mop exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our gross margins  operating income and retained earnings 
we do not believe that near term changes in the exchange rates  if any  will result in a material effect on our future earnings  fair values or cash flows  and therefore  we have chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging transactions 
we cannot assure you that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden change in the value of the hong kong dollar
