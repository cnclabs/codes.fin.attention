item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview for additional overview information relating to our business  including actimmune  co promotion and our product development programs  please see the discussion in item business overview  which is incorporated herein by reference 
significant license acquisition agreements we are highly dependent on technology we license or acquire from third parties 
actimmune  which is currently our sole marketed product  is subject to a license agreement with genentech  inc the majority of our clinical development pipeline is also based on technology that we have licensed from third parties 
details of these agreements can be found elsewhere in this report under item business license and other agreements  notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and under the heading results of operations below 
we will be required to make contingent milestone payments in accordance with all of our license and acquisition agreements in the aggregate amount of million if all of the milestones defined in each of the agreements are achieved 
these milestones include development  regulatory approval  commercialization and sales milestones 
our need for additional capital we commenced operations in and have incurred significant losses to date 
our revenue has been limited primarily to sales of actimmune derived from physicians prescriptions for the off label use of actimmune in the treatment of ipf 
we expect to continue to incur net losses over the next several years as we continue the development of our advanced stage pulmonology pipeline and our research stage hepatology pipeline  apply for regulatory approvals and grow our operations 
although we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  together with anticipated cash flows from our operations  will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  settlement with the government  debt obligations and capital requirements under our current business plan through at least the end of  we believe that we will continue to require substantial additional funding to complete the research and development activities currently contemplated and to commercialize our product candidates 
as a result  we may require additional funds and may attempt to raise additional funds through 
table of contents equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources 
if additional capital is not available  we may be forced to curtail our development activities or cease operations 
discontinuation of actimmune trial for ipf effective march   we made the decision to discontinue the phase inspire clinical trial evaluating actimmune in patients with ipf based upon the recommendation of the study s independent data monitoring committee 
as a result of the disappointing inspire trial results  we revised our estimates of inventory requirements as of december  accordingly  we recorded a charge of million related to the prepayment of inventory that we were expecting to receive in and while we believe other actimmune related assets are recoverable for at least their million net carrying value  if sales decline below our revised estimates  we may incur additional asset impairment charges  including inventory writedowns and impairment of acquired product rights  as well as product returns 
the following table reflects the asset balances as of december  which may be impacted in thousands finished goods inventory acquired product rights  net total we also expect to incur approximately million in restructuring charges  primarily consisting of severance related expenses to implement our announced plan to reduce the workforce by approximately 
we expect to record these charges during in addition  we may incur termination fees related to our supplier and clinical research organization contracts 
any or all of these remaining charges could be material  individually or collectively 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
these estimates are the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  which in turn may impact our reported revenue and expenses 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially change the financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation beginning january   we account for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
in order to estimate the value of share based awards  we use the black scholes model  which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award 
in addition  judgment is 
table of contents also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from any of these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of the company s fiscal year sfas r supersedes the company s previous accounting under apb the company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  reflect the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  the company s consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the year ended december  was million  which consisted of stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options  restricted stock and the employee stock purchase plan the espp 
stock based compensation expense of million for the year ended december  was related to restricted stock which we had been recognizing under previous accounting standards and option acceleration costs related to our divestiture of infergen and concurrent restructuring 
there was no stock based compensation expense related to the espp recognized during the year ended december  if all of the remaining restricted stock awards that were granted in  and became vested  we would recognize approximately million in compensation expense over a weighted average remaining period of years 
if all of the remaining nonvested and outstanding stock option awards that have been granted became vested  we would recognize approximately million in compensation expense over a weighted average remaining period of years 
however  no compensation expense will be recognized for any stock awards that do not vest 
revenue recognition and revenue reserves revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed  and final delivery has occurred and there is a reasonable assurance of collectibility of the amounts receivable from the customer 
therefore  revenue is generally recognized upon delivery when title passes to a credit worthy customer 
reserves are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for estimated returns  rebates  chargebacks and cash discounts  if applicable 
we sell to a limited number of customers  mainly specialty pharmacies and distributors 
we obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price 
we are obligated to accept returns from customers if the pharmaceuticals they purchased have reached the expiration date 
we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns based on historical experience 
due to the nature of our business model and based on historical experience  these estimates are not highly subjective 
we review all sales transactions for potential rebates  chargebacks and discounts each month and monitor product ordering cycles and actual returns  product expiration dates and wholesale inventory levels to estimate potential product return rates 
we believe that our reserves are adequate 
for each of the periods presented below  we have not made any shipments as a result of incentives and or in excess of our customers ordinary course of business inventory levels 
specialty wholesalers maintain low inventory levels and manage their inventory levels to optimize patient based need demand and do not overstock actimmune 
the tables below present the amounts reported as revenue reserves for the periods indicated in thousands  except percentages years ended december  reductions to revenue cash discounts product returns chargebacks medicaid rebates total 
table of contents years ended december  gross product revenue revenue reserve as a of gross product revenue cash discounts product returns chargebacks medicaid rebates total in  chargebacks were approximately of gross revenue  but could reasonably fall within a range of to in any given year depending on the customer base 
if chargebacks had increased to during  this would have reduced our reported revenue by approximately million 
in  medicaid rebates were approximately of gross revenue  but could reasonably fall within a range of to in any given year 
if medicaid rebates had increased to during  this would have decreased our reported revenue by approximately million 
the ranges selected above are based on a review of historical trends and we believe they are reasonably likely to continue to be relevant in future periods 
as a percentage of gross revenue  chargebacks have declined from in to in and to in the decline for the two most recent years compared to is due to a decline in the number of government customers we sell to through our wholesalers 
the decrease in medicaid rebates from in and in to in is due to the decreasing number of patients  as a percentage of the total patient population treated with actimmune  that are covered through state medicaid programs 
the source of information that we monitor in assisting us with computing chargebacks is from the federal supply schedule  veterans administration and public health system pricing documents 
these documents establish the maximum price allowable for the sale of our product to a government customer 
the chargeback amount per unit is computed as the difference between our sales price to the wholesaler and the selling price from the wholesaler to a government customer 
chargebacks are processed directly by the wholesalers and are deducted from payments to us 
the source of information that we monitor in assisting us with computing medicaid rebates is from each of the states 
medicaid rebates are billed directly to us from each state 
billings from each of the states  which are based on end user reports submitted by pharmacies to the state agencies  are typically received within days after the end of each calendar quarter 
we use historical billing and payment trends made to the states to assist us in determining an estimated medicaid rebate amount each period 
clinical trial accruals we accrue costs for clinical trial activities performed by contract research organizations based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each study 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence with contract research organizations and review of contractual terms 
however  if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
to date  we have not experienced changes in estimates that have led to material research and development expense adjustments being recorded in future periods 
inventory reserves and non cancelable purchase obligations for inventory our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and our inventory costs are determined by the first in first out method 
we enter into non cancelable purchase obligations to purchase our inventory based upon 
table of contents sales forecasts to enable us to mitigate some of the risk associated with the long lead times required to manufacture our products 
at december   our minimum purchase obligations totaled million and are committed through the year of these commitments  we have million and million of outstanding fixed purchase order commitments that become due and payable in and  respectively 
given the fact that the phase iii inspire trial was unsuccessful and discontinued in march  in addition to the mechanism set forth in the agreement which allows us to decrease our minimum yearly purchase obligations on a going forward basis with adjustments to the financial terms to be negotiated by the parties we are currently reviewing other aspects of the contracts that we believe are relevant to our future purchase commitments  including our ability to cancel previously provided forecasts and eliminate our purchase obligations 
we write off the cost of inventory and reserve for future minimum purchase commitments that we consider to be in excess of forecasted future demand 
we define excess inventory as inventory that will expire before it can be sold  based on future sales forecasts 
in making these assessments  we are required to make judgments as to the future demand for current or committed inventory purchase levels 
we are also required to monitor the expiration dates of our products  since our products can no longer be used after their respective expiration dates 
in  in an effort to best manage the procurement and distribution of levels of actimmune  we successfully completed the necessary testing to extend the expiration period of actimmune from months to a total of months 
as part of our excess inventory assessment for all of our products  we also estimate the expiration dates of our products to be manufactured in the future 
projected revenue trends resulted in us recording charges during and for excess inventories and non cancelable purchase obligations 
if actimmune revenue levels experienced in future periods are substantially below our current expectations  we could be required to record additional charges for excess inventories and or non cancelable purchase obligations 
for the year ended december   we recorded a charge of million  or per share  to cost of goods sold for excess inventory 
please refer to the statements under item a 
risk factors in this report to gain a better understanding of the possible reasons why actual results could differ from our estimates 
results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations for each of the comparative periods excludes infergen revenues and related expenses 
these amounts are reflected in discontinued operations as a result of the sale of the infergen product to valeant in december comparison of years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december   we recorded total net revenue of million  compared to million for the same period in  a decrease of 
net sales of actimmune for were million  compared to million for  a decline of 
for the year ended december  actimmune accounted for all of our product revenue and approximately of our total product revenue in substantially all of these sales were derived from physicians prescriptions for the off label use of actimmune in the treatment of ipf 
net revenue in includes approximately million of collaboration revenue  which represents amortization of the million upfront payment received from roche during the fourth quarter of actimmune sales declined during the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in due to a decrease in the underlying demand for actimmune 
we believe that rate of patient referrals by physicians and the average duration of therapy are among the key uncertainties that affect demand for actimmune and our actimmune revenue and total product revenue 
the patient referral rate reflects the number of new patients who are prescribed actimmune and who call the call center that coordinates with all of our specialty distributors  although these patients may elect not to have those prescriptions filled 
we believe that the following factors are among those that may affect the patient referral rate for actimmune physician screening of patients who are likely to pursue treatment with actimmune  physician or patient interest and the publication of the results of our initial phase iii ipf clinical trial  as well as the disappointing results of the inspire trial 

table of contents cost of goods sold cost of goods sold included product manufacturing costs  royalties and distribution costs associated with our revenue and inventory reserves 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million  or approximately of total product revenue  compared to million  or approximately of total product revenue  in the corresponding period of the decrease in cost of goods sold primarily reflects the decline in actimmune revenue and a charge of million in taken for excess inventory from previous years contractual purchases 
included in cost of goods sold is a charge of approximately million recorded in connection with the disappointing phase iii inspire trial results announced in march excluding the million and million charges for excess inventory and purchase commitments in and  respectively  cost of goods sold was approximately of product revenue for each of the years ended december  and exchange rate fluctuations on inventory purchases may affect cost of goods sold on actimmune inventory purchased from bi 
in the past  we have utilized forward exchange contracts to partially offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  but we did not enter into any new contracts in or amortization and impairment of acquired product rights we recorded amortization and impairment of acquired product rights for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively 
the acquired product rights were related to the acquisition of amphotec and interferon gamma b patents 
in march  we recorded an impairment charge of million 
this impairment charge was based on our impairment review of the amphotec product rights  which took into account that sales levels were lower than expected and that amphotec was not aligned with our new strategic focus in pulmonology and hepatology 
in may  we divested the amphotec product line  including all related assets  to three rivers for cash consideration 
research and development expenses research and development r d expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of million or 
the increase in r d expense in was related to increased investment in the company s two phase clinical development programs in ipf  the manufacturing  preclinical and clinical activities for itmn prior to entering into the collaboration agreement with roche and an increased investment in pulmonology and hepatology research 
r d expense also includes million of stock based compensation expense in  reflecting the adoption of sfas r 
the following table lists our current product development programs and the research and development expenses recognized in connection with each program during the indicated periods 
the category titled programs non specific is comprised of facilities and personnel costs that are not allocated to a specific development program or discontinued programs and million of stock based compensation in our management reviews each of these program categories in evaluating our business 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with developing our products  as well as the risks and uncertainties associated with potential commercialization of our product candidates  see the specific sections under item a 
risk factors above 
year ended december  development program in thousands pulmonology hepatology oncology programs non specific total the largest component of our total operating expenses is our ongoing investments in research and development and  in particular  the clinical development of our product pipeline 
the process of conducting the clinical research 
table of contents necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
current fda requirements for a new human drug to be marketed in the united states include the successful conclusion of preclinical laboratory and animal tests  if appropriate  to gain preliminary information on the product s safety  the submission of an ind with the fda to conduct human clinical trials for drugs  the successful completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical investigations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its recommended use  and the submission by a company and acceptance and approval by the fda of an nda or bla for a drug product to allow commercial distribution of the drug 
in light of the factors mentioned above  we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be crucial to our long term success 
the actual probability of success for each candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the candidate  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
due to these factors  it is difficult to give accurate guidance on the anticipated proportion of our research and development investments or the future cash inflows from these programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative sg a expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or 
sg a expense also includes million of stock based compensation expense in  reflecting the adoption of sfas r 
the decreased spending for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was largely the result of the reductions in field based ipf disease awareness activities and a decrease in the number of personnel in the home office  as announced in november acquired research and development and milestone credits payments there were no charges for acquired research and development and milestone payments in the years ended december  and included in our charges prior to was million for a milestone payable to eli lilly for oritavancin 
we initially expensed this amount as acquired research and development as oritavancin at the time was in clinical development  had not reached technical feasibility and had no foreseeable alternative future uses 
in connection with the divestiture of oritavancin to targanta in december  we received a waiver from eli lilly for making this payment and thus reversed the accrued liability for this milestone in provision for government settlement on november   we received a subpoena from the us department of justice requiring us to provide the department of justice with certain information relating to actimmune  including information regarding the promotion and marketing of actimmune 
on october   we reached a comprehensive settlement with the government concerning promotional activities for actimmune by former employees during a period that ended in june a million charge was recorded during to reflect the final terms of the civil settlement agreement 
the settlement resolves without criminal sanctions  all outstanding government investigations of intermune 
we agreed to pay a total of million  plus interest on the then outstanding principal balance  over a period of five years 
as part of the settlement  intermune also entered into corporate integrity and deferred prosecution agreements with the government 
restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan recommended by our chief executive officer and senior management that was designed to help streamline our operations and reduce our operating expenses in the plan  which consisted of a significant reduction in our investment in field based ipf disease awareness activities  was implemented concurrently with the divestiture of infergen in december 
table of contents these combined actions led to a significant headcount reduction of approximately employees and resulting termination costs of approximately million 
restructuring charges comprised approximately million of this amount which were recorded as a separate component of operating expenses in the statement of operations  with the remainder allocated to discontinued operations 
see loss from discontinued operations discussion below 
the majority of the employees left intermune at the end of the fourth quarter of and the remainder during the first quarter of the million restructuring charge was comprised of approximately million for cash severance and related benefits and approximately million for non cash stock compensation  consisting of an allocation of option acceleration costs for approximately  shares of our common stock 
we paid substantially all of the million severance and related benefits during the first quarter of no further restructuring charges were incurred in given our decision to discontinue the inspire trial effective march  we expect to incur approximately million in restructuring charges during the first several quarters of  primarily consisting of severance related expenses to implement our announced plan to reduce the workforce by approximately

the loss in also included employee termination costs of approximately million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
gain on sale of discontinued operations the gain on sale of discontinued operations in was comprised of the million in cash proceeds and a million note received from valeant in connection with the sale of infergen  offset by the net book value of the assets sold and direct transaction costs 
these assets included intellectual property rights  payments to a contract manufacturer  and inventory with a net book value of approximately million at the time of the transaction 
in addition  we incurred approximately million of direct transaction costs related to the sale of infergen 

table of contents provision for income taxes due to our continuing operating losses and the uncertainty of our recognizing the potential future benefits from these losses  we recorded no provision or benefit for income taxes for the years ended december  and as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
we also have federal research and development tax credits of approximately million that will expire in the years through in addition  we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately million that expire in the years through and state research and development tax credits of approximately million that do not expire 
utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization

cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million  or approximately of total net revenue  compared to million  or approximately of total net revenue  in the corresponding period of the increase in cost of goods sold primarily reflects a charge of million taken for excess inventory from previous years contractual purchases compared to a million charge taken in for the same reason 
excluding these charges for excess inventory  cost of goods sold was approximately of total revenue for each of the years ended december  and exchange rate fluctuations on inventory purchases may affect cost of goods sold on actimmune inventory purchased from bi 
we have utilized forward exchange contracts to partially offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations in the past  but we did not enter into any new contracts in amortization and impairment of acquired product rights we recorded amortization and impairment of acquired product rights for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively 
the acquired product rights were related to the acquisition of amphotec and interferon gamma b patents 
in march  we recorded an impairment charge of million 
this impairment charge was based on our impairment review of the amphotec product rights  which took into account that sales levels were lower than expected and that amphotec was not aligned with our new strategic focus in pulmonology and hepatology 
in may  we divested the amphotec product line  including all related assets  to three rivers for cash consideration 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of million or

the increased loss in compared to was the result of a greater level of sales and marketing expenses to support infergen  including the representative sales force hired in the fourth quarter of  and the full year impact of the phase iii trial of once daily treatment with infergen in combination with ribavirin therapy for hepatitis c peg nonresponder patients 
these increased expenses were offset by the gross margin on higher levels of infergen revenue see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

provision for income taxes due to our continuing operating losses and the uncertainty of our recognizing the potential future benefits from these losses  we recorded no provision or benefit for income taxes for the years ended december  and liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of million compared to million at december  the slight decrease was the result of operating losses  partially offset by the million upfront milestone we received from roche under the collaboration agreement and million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under our employee stock plans 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us federal and state governments and their agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure by imposing concentration limits and credit worthiness requirements for all corporate issuers 
operating activities cash used in operating activities was million during the year ended december   comprised primarily of a net loss of million and a significant decrease in accounts payable and accrued compensation of approximately million 
this use of cash is net of the million deferred revenue balance as a result of the upfront milestone received from roche under the collaboration agreement  the provision for government settlement  stock based compensation expense of million and a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued compensation was the result of approximately million in severance payments made in connection with the headcount reduction at the end of as a result of our decision to concurrently sell our infergen assets and reduce our investment in field based ipf disease awareness activities 
in addition  we reduced the days outstanding in our trade payables  thus reducing our accounts payable balance by approximately million 
the decrease in accounts receivable is primarily due to the decline in actimmune 
table of contents sales and the elimination of infergen sales 
details concerning the loss from operations can be found above in this report under the heading results of operations 
investing activities investing activities used million in cash flows during the year ended december   primarily due to investment purchases of million made after the receipt of million from the divestiture of infergen late in december we also had maturities and sales of available for sale securities totaling million  which partially offset the purchases during the year 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  was due to the proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under our employee stock plans 
we do not have any special purpose entities that are unconsolidated in our financial statements 
we have no commercial commitments with related parties 
we have no loans with related parties  except for executive loans to dr 
marianne armstrong  our chief medical affairs and regulatory officer in the amount of million due april  and dr 
lawrence blatt  our chief scientific officer  in the amount of million due may 
both of these loans were in place prior to the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act in we believe that we will continue to require substantial additional funding to complete the research and development activities currently contemplated and to commercialize our product candidates 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  together with anticipated cash flows from our operations  will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  settlement with the government  debt obligations and capital requirements under our current business plan through at least the end of however  this forward looking statement involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed under item a 
risk factors 
this forward looking statement is also based upon our current plans and assumptions  which may change  and our capital requirements  which may increase in future periods 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to sales of actimmune or any of our product candidates in development that receive commercial approval  our ability to partner our programs or products  the progress of our research and development efforts  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  determinations as to the commercial potential of our product candidates in development  the pace of expansion of administrative expenses  the status of competitive products and competitive barriers to entry  the establishment and maintenance of manufacturing capacity through third party manufacturing agreements  the pace of expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities  in preparation for product launches  the establishment of collaborative relationships with other companies  the payments of annual interest on our long term debt  the payments related to the civil settlement agreement with the government  the timing and size of the payments we may receive from roche pursuant to the collaboration agreement  and whether we must repay the principal in connection with our convertible debt obligations

we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a change in market rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio
