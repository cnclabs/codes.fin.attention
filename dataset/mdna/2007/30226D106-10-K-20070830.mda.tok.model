value added resellers  or vars 
we have entered into agreements to sell our products through more than resellers in approximately countries 
our value added resellers include regional networking system resellers  resellers who focus on specific vertical markets  network integrators and wholesale distributors 
we provide training and support to our resellers and our resellers generally provide the first level of support to end users of our products 
our relationships with resellers are generally on a non exclusive basis 
our resellers are not given privileges to return inventory and do not automatically participate in any cooperative marketing programs 
we generally recognize product revenue from our reseller and end user customers at the time of shipment  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price of the product is fixed or determinable and collection of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured 
when significant obligations or contingencies remain after products are delivered  such as installation or customer acceptance  revenue and related costs are deferred until such obligations or contingencies are satisfied

field sales 
we have trained our field sales organization to support and develop leads for our value added resellers and to establish and maintain a limited number of key accounts and strategic end user customers 
to support these objectives  our field sales force assists end user customers in finding solutions to complex network system and architecture problems  
table of contents differentiates the features and capabilities of our products from competitive offerings  continually monitors and understands the evolving networking needs of enterprise and service provider customers  promotes our products and ensures direct contact with current and potential customers  partners with our key resellers to drive closure of business opportunities  and monitors the changing requirements of our customers 
as of july   our worldwide sales and marketing organization consisted of individuals  including directors  managers  sales representatives  and technical and administrative support personnel 
we have domestic sales offices located in states and international sales offices located in countries 
international sales international sales are an important portion of our business 
in fiscal  sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for of our consolidated net revenues  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal these sales are conducted primarily through foreign based distributors and resellers managed by our worldwide sales organization  in addition to direct sales to end user customers  including large global accounts 
the primary markets for sales outside of the united states include the countries in western europe  the asia pacific region and japan 
although not a significant component of total revenues to date  we also sell our products in south america  canada and mexico 
marketing we have a number of marketing programs to support the sale and distribution of our products and to inform existing and potential customers and our distributors and resellers about the features and performance of our products 
our marketing efforts include participation in industry tradeshows  technical conferences and technology seminars  preparation of competitive analyses  sales training  and publication of technical and educational articles in industry journals  a publicly available website  web based training courses  advertising and public relations 
in addition  we are developing e commerce processes and systems for our resellers  distributors and end user customers 
we also submit our products for independent product testing and evaluation 
backlog our products are often sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancelable prior to shipment without significant penalties 
in addition  purchase orders are subject to changes in quantities of products and delivery schedules in order to reflect changes in customer requirements and manufacturing capacity 
our business is characterized by seasonal variability in demand and short lead time orders and delivery schedules 
actual shipments depend on the then current capacity of our contract manufacturer and the availability of materials and components from our vendors 
we believe that only a small portion of our order backlog is non cancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the non cancelable portion is not material 
accordingly  we do not believe that backlog at any given time is a meaningful indicator of future revenue

manufacturing we outsource the majority of our manufacturing and supply chain management operations as part of our strategy to maintain global manufacturing capabilities and to reduce our costs 
we conduct quality assurance  manufacturing engineering  document control and test development at our main campus in santa clara  california 
this approach enables us to reduce fixed costs and to flexibly respond to changes in market demand 
we have a strategic partnership with flextronics international  ltd 
for the manufacture of our oem products in san jose  california and guadalajara  mexico 
flextronics manufacturing processes and procedures are iso certified 
our commitment with flextronics is formalized through a one year contract 
we design and develop the key components of our products  including asics and printed circuit boards 
we determine the components that are incorporated in our products and select the appropriate suppliers of such components 
flextronics utilizes automated testing equipment to perform product testing and burn in with specified tests 
together we rely upon comprehensive inspection testing and statistical process controls to assure the quality and reliability of our products 
we also maintain a strategic relationship with alpha networks  inc headquartered in hsinchu  taiwan

extreme networks is one of alpha s top five strategic partners as measured by revenue 
we intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements that will require us to rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating our efforts with those of our suppliers and contract manufacturer 
although we use standard parts and components for our products where it is appropriate  we currently purchase several key components used in the manufacture of our products from single or limited sources 
our principal single source components include asics  merchant silicon  microprocessors  programmable integrated circuits  selected other integrated circuits  
table of contents custom power supplies  and custom tooled sheet metal 
our principal limited source components include flash memory  dynamic and static random access memories  or drams and srams respectively  printed circuit boards  and content addressable memories cams 
purchase commitments with our single or limited source suppliers are generally on a purchase order basis 
a number of vendors supply standard product integrated circuits and microprocessors for our products 
any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these components  or the inability to procure these components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable time  may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
qualifying additional suppliers can be time consuming and expensive and may increase the likelihood of errors 
we use our forecast of expected demand to determine our material requirements 
lead times for materials and components vary significantly  and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
we order most of our materials and components on an indirect basis through our contract manufacturer 
research and development the success of our products to date is due in large part to our focus on research and development 
we believe that continued success in the marketplace will depend on our ability to develop new and enhanced products employing leading edge technology

in fiscal  we opened a research and development center in chennai  india focusing on the development and verification of our operating systems 
our research and development expenses in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were million  million  and million  respectively 
competition the market for switches is part of the broader market for networking equipment  which is dominated by a few large companies  particularly cisco systems 
in addition  there are a number of large telecommunications 
table of contents equipment providers  including alcatel and nortel networks  which have entered the market for network equipment  particularly through acquisitions of public and privately held companies 
we expect to face increased competition  particularly price competition  from these and other telecommunications equipment providers 
we also compete with other public and private companies that offer switching solutions  including enterasys networks  inc  foundry networks  inc  huawei technologies corporation  com corporation  hewlett packard company and dell computer corporation 
these vendors offer products with functionality similar to our products or provide alternative network solutions 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to develop and offer competitive products 
furthermore  we compete with numerous companies that offer routers and other technologies and devices that traditionally have managed the flow of traffic on the enterprise or metro networks 
some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger installed customer base  than we do 
as a result  these competitors are able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products 
in addition  competitors with a large installed customer base may have a significant competitive advantage over us 
we have encountered  and expect to continue to encounter  many potential customers who are confident in and committed to the product offerings of our principal competitors  including cisco systems 
accordingly  these potential customers may not consider or evaluate our products 
when such potential customers have considered or evaluated our products  we have in the past lost  and expect in the future to lose  sales to some of these customers as large competitors have offered significant price discounts to secure these sales 
we believe the principal competitive factors in the network switching market are expertise and familiarity with network protocols  network switching and network management  product performance  features  functionality and reliability  price performance characteristics  timeliness of new product introductions  adoption of emerging industry standards  customer service and support  size and scope of distribution network  brand name  access to customers  and size of installed customer base 
we believe that we compete favorably with our competitors with respect to each of the foregoing factors 
however  because many of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases  broader product lines and substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  they may have larger distribution channels  stronger brand names  access to more customers and a larger installed customer base than we do 
such competitors may  among other things  be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to distribution partners than we can 
to remain competitive  we believe that we must  among other things  invest significant resources in developing new products and enhancing our current products and maintain customer satisfaction worldwide 
if we fail to do so  our products will not compete favorably with those of our competitors and that may have a material adverse effect on our business 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
based on our commitment to build a patent portfolio  we 
table of contents have in process a number of patent applications relating to our proprietary technology 
we have filed patent applications in selected countries abroad as deemed appropriate 
there can be no assurance that these applications will be approved  that any issued patents will protect our intellectual property  or that third parties will not challenge these patents or applications 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar or competing technology or design around any patents that we may obtain 
with respect to trademarks  we have a number of pending and registered trademarks in the united states and abroad 
we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and control access to  and distribution of  our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
in addition  we provide our software products to end user customers primarily under shrink wrap license agreements included within the packaged software 
these agreements are not negotiated with or signed by the licensee  and thus these agreements may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
there can be no assurance that these precautions will prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
as detailed below under legal proceedings  we are currently engaged in litigation with enterasys networks  inc enterasys 
enterasys is asserting claims that allege infringement of certain patent rights  against which we are defending vigorously  but we cannot assure you that we will prevail in this litigation 
in addition to the litigation with enterasys  in the normal course of our business from time to time  we are in discussions with companies that assert certain of our products require a license under a number of patents 
due to the number of companies with extensive patent portfolios in our industry who are or may be actively involved in licensing programs  we believe that even if we do not infringe any patents  we may incur significant expenses in the future due to disputes or licensing negotiations  though the amounts and timing of such expenses cannot be determined with any reasonable certainty 
as the functionality and features of our products expand  these disputes and discussions could increase or become harder to resolve 
employees as of july   we employed people  including in sales and marketing  in engineering  in operations  in customer support and service  and in finance and administration 
we have never had a work stoppage and no personnel are represented under collective bargaining agreements 
we consider our employee relations to be good 
we believe that our future success depends on our continued ability to attract  integrate  retain  train and motivate highly qualified personnel  and upon the continued service of our senior management and key personnel 
none of our personnel is bound by an employment agreement 
the market for qualified personnel is competitive  particularly in the san francisco bay area  where our headquarters is located 
at times  we have experienced difficulties in attracting new personnel and we have experienced attrition that has affected our operating results

table of contents item a 
risk factors we are subject to a number of risks 
some of these risks are endemic to the networking industry and are the same or similar to those disclosed in our previous sec filings 
the following is a list of risks and uncertainties which may have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the risks and uncertainties set out below are not the only risks and uncertainties we face 
we were not in compliance with sec reporting requirements during fiscal year  and nasdaq listing requirements during portions of fiscal years and  and we may continue to face compliance issues with both 
if we are unable to remain in compliance with sec reporting requirements and nasdaq listing requirements  there may be a material adverse effect on the company and our stockholders 
on september   based on information developed by company management and at the audit committee s recommendation  the board of directors appointed a special committee of the board the special committee to conduct an independent investigation of our historical practices for granting and accounting for stock options and to present findings and recommendations to the board 
pending completion of our special committee investigation  we were delinquent in filing certain of our periodic reports with the sec during fiscal year  and we were unable to hold our annual meeting of stockholders within the time required under nasdaq marketplace rules 
although such delinquent reports were filed with the sec on june   and our annual meeting of stockholders occurred on july   we were not in compliance with nasdaq s marketplace rules during portions of fiscal years and as a result  we underwent a review and hearing process with nasdaq to determine our listing status 
nasdaq ultimately permitted our securities to remain listed on the nasdaq global select market  but our securities could be delisted in the future if we do not maintain compliance with applicable listing requirements in the future 
if this happens  the price of our stock  the ability of our stockholders to trade in our stock  and our ability to raise capital could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to remain in compliance with the sec reporting requirements  we would be subject to a number of restrictions regarding the registration of our stock under federal securities laws  and we may not be able to issue stock options or other equity awards to our employees or allow them to exercise their outstanding options  which would adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we have been named as a party to shareholder derivative lawsuits relating to our historical stock option practices  and we may be named in additional lawsuits in the future 
this litigation could become time consuming and expensive and could result in the payment of significant judgments and settlements  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in connection with our historical stock option practices and resulting restatement of our financial statements for the fiscal years through  derivative actions were filed against certain of our current and former directors and officers purporting to assert claims on the company s behalf 
there may be additional lawsuits filed in the future 
we cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits  nor can we predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve these lawsuits 
if these lawsuits become time consuming and expensive  or if there are unfavorable outcomes in any of these cases  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our insurance coverage will not cover all of our liabilities and expenses in these lawsuits  in part because we have a significant deductible on certain aspects of the coverage 
in addition  subject to certain limitations  we may be obligated to indemnify our current and former directors  officers and employees 
we currently hold insurance policies for the benefit of our directors and officers  however our insurance coverage may not be sufficient in some or all of these matters to cover all of the costs the company may need to incur 
furthermore  the insurers may seek to deny or limit coverage in some or all of these matters  in which case we may have to self fund all or a substantial portion of our indemnification obligations 
if we need to self fund  there is no assurance that we will prevail in our efforts to recover payment from our insurers 

table of contents the special committee investigation of our historical stock option practices and resulting restatements has been time consuming and expensive  and may have a material adverse effect on us 
the special committee investigation and the activities related to the restatement of our fiscal through fiscal financial statements have required us to expend significant management time and to incur significant accounting  legal  and other expenses 
although the special committee has concluded its investigation  the special committee may continue to assist the company with follow up activities arising from the restatement or otherwise related to its investigation 
the issues surrounding the historical stock option grant practices were complex and required substantial resources to resolve 
the cost and time associated with concluding any follow up activities by the special committee may have a material adverse effect on our operating results or our common stock price 
the period of time necessary to resolve any such follow up matters is uncertain  and these matters could require significant additional attention and resources 
the discovery that we had not accounted correctly for historical stock option grants has had  and may continue to have  a material adverse effect on our financial results 
we cannot predict the outcome of any government inquiry or the pending shareholder derivative lawsuits  and we may face future government actions  shareholder lawsuits and other legal proceedings related to our historical stock option practices 
all of these events have required us  and will continue to require us  to expend significant management time and to incur significant accounting  legal  and other expenses 
this has and could continue to divert attention and resources from the operation of our business and adversely affects our financial condition and results of operations 
any government inquiry relating to our historical stock option practices may be time consuming and expensive and could result in injunctions  fines and penalties that may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the sec issued an informal request to us for information relating to our historical stock option grant practices 
we have responded to the sec s inquiry and will respond to inquiries from other government authorities if made 
the sec and or other government authorities may conduct a formal investigation into our historical stock option grant practices 
the period of time necessary to resolve any such inquiry is uncertain  and we cannot predict the outcome of any such inquiry or whether we will face additional government inquiries  investigations or other actions related to our historical stock option practices  or otherwise 
these matters will likely require us to continue to expend significant management time and incur significant legal and other expenses  and could result in civil and criminal actions seeking  among other things  injunctions against the company and the payment of significant fines and penalties by the company  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
a formal investigation by the sec and or other government authorities could adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
it may be difficult or costly to obtain director and officer insurance coverage as a result of our stock option related issues 
we expect that the issues arising from our previous historical stock option grant practices and related accounting may make it more difficult to obtain director and officer insurance coverage in the future 
if we are able to obtain this coverage  it could be significantly more costly than in the past  which would have an adverse effect on our financial results and cash flow 
as a result of this and related factors  our directors and officers could face increased risks of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  we may have difficultly attracting and retaining qualified directors and officers  which could adversely affect our business 
we cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future 
we reported losses for fiscal    and and our revenue declined in fiscal in addition  while we have reported profits in both fiscal and  we were not profitable in each quarter 
table of contents during those years 
we anticipate continuing to incur significant sales and marketing  product development and general and administrative expenses and  as a result  we will continue to need to rationalize expense levels and increase revenue levels to achieve profitability in future fiscal periods 
failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may cause us to delay filing our periodic reports with the sec  affect our nasdaq listing  and adversely affect our stock price 
the securities and exchange commission  as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on form k 
in addition  our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on our internal control over financial reporting 
although we review our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the section requirements  if our independent registered public accounting firm is not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or the level at which these controls are documented  designed  operated or reviewed  or if the independent registered public accounting firm interprets the requirements  rules and or regulations differently from our interpretation  then they may decline to attest to management s assessment or may issue a report that is qualified 
this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which ultimately could negatively impact our stock price 
federal securities laws  rules and regulations  as well as nasdaq rules and regulations  require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures  impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements  set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers  chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations 
these laws  rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase the scope  complexity and cost of our corporate governance  reporting and disclosure practices  which could harm our results of operations and divert management s attention from business operations 
a number of factors could cause our quarterly financial results to be worse than expected  resulting in a decline in our stock price 
our ability to control our operating expenses at a level that is consistent with anticipated revenue is significant to our financial results 
a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term  so any delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause our quarterly operating results to fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the price of our stock to fall 
orders in our backlog at the beginning of each quarter do not equal expected revenues for that quarter and are generally cancelable at any time 
accordingly  we are dependent upon obtaining orders during a quarter and shipping those orders in the same quarter to achieve our revenue objectives 
in addition  the timing of product releases and purchase orders  and product availability  often results in a majority of our product shipments being scheduled near the end of a quarter 
failure to ship these products by the end of a quarter may adversely affect our operating results 
our customer agreements generally allow customers to delay scheduled delivery dates or to cancel orders within specified timeframes without significant charges to the customers 
furthermore  some of our customers require that we provide installation or inspection services that may delay the recognition of revenue for both products and services  and some of our customer agreements include acceptance provisions that prevent our ability to recognize revenue upon shipment 
we may experience a delay in generating or recognizing revenue for a number of reasons and our quarterly revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the following changes in general and or specific economic conditions in the networking industry  seasonal fluctuations in demand for our products and services  particularly in asia pacific and europe  
table of contents the level of attrition of our employees  and of our sales force in particular  a disproportionate percentage of our sales occurring in the last month of the quarter  reduced visibility into the implementation cycles for our products and our customers spending plans  our ability to forecast demand for our products  which in the case of lower than expected sales  may result in excess or obsolete inventory in addition to non cancelable purchase commitments for component parts  product returns or the cancellation or rescheduling of orders  our ability to develop  introduce  ship and support new products and product enhancements and manage product transitions  announcements and new product introductions by our competitors  our ability to develop and support relationships with enterprise customers  service providers and other potential large customers  our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions  fluctuations in warranty or other service expenses actually incurred  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components for our products on a timely basis  increases in the prices of the components that we purchase  decreases in the prices of the products that we sell  our ability to achieve and maintain desired production volumes and quality levels for our products  the mix of products sold and the mix of distribution channels through which products are sold  impairment charges associated with long lived assets  restructuring costs associated with adjustments to the size of our operations  costs relating to possible acquisitions and the integration of technologies or businesses  the effect of amortization of purchased intangibles resulting from new transactions  and costs relating to the recognition of share based payments 
in fiscal and fiscal  we reported revenues below our expectations 
our results were particularly impacted by lower sales in most regions in fiscal we believe that revenues will increase in coming quarters  however  our future results could be adversely affected if longer term economic or industry trends are unfavorable 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
intense competition in the market for networking equipment could prevent us from increasing revenue and achieving profitability 
the market for networking equipment is intensely competitive 
the market for switches is part of the broader market for networking equipment  which is dominated by a few large companies  particularly cisco systems 
in addition  there are a number of large telecommunications equipment providers  including alcatel and nortel networks  which have entered the market for network equipment  particularly through acquisitions of 
table of contents public and privately held companies 
we expect to face increased competition  particularly price competition  from these and other telecommunications equipment providers 
we also compete with other public and private companies that offer switching solutions  including enterasys networks  inc  foundry networks  inc  huawei technologies corporation  com corporation  hewlett packard company and dell computer corporation 
these vendors offer products with functionality similar to our products or provide alternative network solutions 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to develop and offer competitive products 
furthermore  we compete with numerous companies that offer routers and other technologies and devices that traditionally have managed the flow of traffic on the enterprise or metro networks 
some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger installed customer base  than we do 
as a result  these competitors are able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products 
in addition  competitors with a large installed customer base may have a significant competitive advantage over us 
we have encountered  and expect to continue to encounter  many potential customers who are confident in and committed to the product offerings of our principal competitors  including cisco systems 
accordingly  these potential customers may not consider or evaluate our products 
when such potential customers have considered or evaluated our products  we have in the past lost  and expect in the future to lose  sales to some of these customers as large competitors have offered significant price discounts to secure these sales 
the pricing policies of our competitors impact the overall demand for our products and services 
some of our competitors are capable of operating at significant losses for extended periods of time  increasing pricing pressure on our products and services 
if we do not maintain competitive pricing  the demand for our products and services  as well as our market share  may decline 
from time to time  we may lower the prices of our products and services 
when this happens  if we are unable to reduce our component costs or improve operating efficiencies  our revenues and margins will be adversely affected 
to remain competitive  we believe that we must  among other things  invest significant resources in developing new products  improve our current products and maintain customer satisfaction 
such investment will increase our expenses and affect our profitability 
if we fail to make this investment  we may not be able to compete successfully with our competitors  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and future profitability 
when our products contain undetected errors  we may incur significant unexpected expenses and could lose sales 
network products frequently contain undetected errors when new products or new versions or updates of existing products are released to the marketplace 
in the past  we have experienced such errors in connection with new products and product upgrades 
we have experienced component problems in prior years that caused us to incur higher than expected warranty  service costs and expenses  and other related operating expenses 
in the future  we expect that  from time to time  such errors or component failures will be found in new or existing products after the commencement of commercial shipments 
these problems may have a material adverse effect on our business by causing us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  diverting the attention of our engineering personnel from new product development efforts  delaying the recognition of revenue and causing significant customer relations problems 
further  if products are not accepted by customers due to such defects  and such returns exceed the amount we accrued for defect returns based on our historical experience  our operating results would be adversely affected 
our products must successfully interoperate with products from other vendors 
as a result  when problems occur in a network  it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems 
the occurrence of system errors  whether or not caused by our products  could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and 
table of contents any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses 
the occurrence of any such problems would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our future success will depend in part upon increasing our revenue in the us market 
revenues in the us declined in fiscal from fiscal and declined in fiscal from fiscal we believe a number of factors have contributed to the decline in our revenues in the us  including turnover in our sales and marketing personnel  intense competition  as well as the timing of customer purchase decisions 
our success will depend upon increasing our revenue in the united states and we may need to identify new strategies or markets to increase revenue 
we are initiating a number of programs to improve retention of our sales personnel and to compete more effectively in the us market 
if these efforts are not successful  our ability to sustain and grow our revenue and to achieve increased profitability would be adversely affected 
we depend upon international sales for a significant portion of our revenue and our ability to grow our international sales depends on successfully expanding our international operations 
international sales constitute a significant portion of our net revenues 
our ability to grow will depend in part on the expansion of international sales 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of our net revenues for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our international sales primarily depend on the success of our resellers and distributors 
the failure of these resellers and distributors to sell our products internationally would limit our ability to sustain and grow our revenue 
there are a number of risks arising from our international business  including longer accounts receivable collection cycles  difficulties in managing operations across disparate geographic areas  difficulties associated with enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems  the payment of operating expenses in local currencies  which exposes us to risks of currency fluctuations  higher credit risks requiring cash in advance or letters of credit  difficulty in safeguarding intellectual property  political and economic turbulence  potential adverse tax consequences  and unexpected changes in existing regulatory requirements and the addition of new regulatory requirements 
our international sales currently are us dollar denominated 
future increases in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
in the future  we may elect to invoice some of our international customers in local currency  which will expose us to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the particular local currency 
if we do so  we may decide to engage in hedging transactions to minimize the risk of such fluctuations 
we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the impact of payment of operating expenses in local currencies to some of our operating foreign subsidiaries 
however  if we are not successful in managing these hedging transactions  we could incur losses from hedging activities 
conducting our business on a global basis requires us to comply with various foreign and domestic regulatory requirements 
conducting our business on a global basis subjects us to a number of frequently changing and complex regulatory requirements  and as we expand our operations into new territories  we may become subject to an 
table of contents increasing number of such regulatory requirements 
these regulatory requirements vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  and may be inconsistent with one another 
our efforts to comply with the new and differing requirements increases our costs of goods and other expenses and may delay the production and shipment of our products  which could adversely impact revenue recognition and harm our financial results 
in addition  failure to comply with the requirements of a single jurisdiction may adversely impact our ability to do business in that jurisdiction as well as other jurisdictions  which would harm our financial results 
trade measures  environmental and import and export requirements are among the regulations with which we must comply 
failure to comply with such requirements may result in the imposition of financial penalties and restrictions on our ability to conduct business in and with certain countries  which may harm our business and damage our reputation 
in the past  we were subject to an investigation by the us department of commerce in connection with the possible violation of certain export regulations 
the department of commerce has completed an investigation and we were required to pay a fine of  while this matter was resolved and we have also implemented procedures to reduce the risk of violations in the future  there can be no assurances that we will not become subject to such investigations in the future 
in connection with compliance with regulatory requirements  from time to time  we have been and may in the future become subject to audit by various governmental agencies seeking to review the compliance of our products or business practices with their regulations 
when such audits occur and whether or not we are in compliance with the particular regulation  we may be required to cease shipment or production of our product in that particular jurisdiction while we seek to show our compliance with such regulations and our business may be adversely affected as a result 
we expect the average selling prices of our products to decrease  which may reduce gross margin and or revenue 
the network equipment industry has traditionally experienced a rapid erosion of average selling prices due to a number of factors  including competitive pricing pressures  promotional pricing and technological progress 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures  excess inventories  increased sales discounts and new product introductions by us or our competitors  including  for example  competitive products manufactured with low cost merchant silicon 
we may experience substantial decreases in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 
to maintain our gross margin  we must develop and introduce on a timely basis new products and product enhancements and continually reduce our product costs 
our failure to do so would likely cause our revenue and gross margins to decline  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
some of our customers may not have the resources to pay for our products as a result of the current economic environment 
as of july   no customers accounted for more than of our accounts receivable balance 
some of our customers are likely to experience serious cash flow problems and  as a result  may find it difficult to obtain financing  if financing is available at all 
if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or securing alternate financing arrangements  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  the amounts that they owe us 
in addition  sales to the service provider market are especially volatile and continued declines or delays in sale orders from this market may harm our financial condition 
furthermore  they may not order as many products from us as originally forecast  or cancel orders with us entirely 
the inability of some of our potential customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our cash flow  the timing of our revenue recognition and the amount of revenue  which may cause our stock price to decline 

table of contents if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel as necessary  we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our goals 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing  service and operations personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
we do not have employment contracts with these individuals nor do we carry life insurance on any of our key personnel and we have experienced significant turn over in our executive personnel 
we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales and marketing  service  finance and operations personnel 
the market for these personnel is competitive  especially in the san francisco bay area  and we have had difficulty in hiring employees  particularly engineers  in the timeframe we desire 
in addition  retention has become more difficult for us and other public technology companies as a result of the stock market decline  which caused the price of many of our employees stock options to be above the current market price of our stock and we are experiencing a high level of attrition 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining our key personnel 
a number of our key executives have left the company in the last year  including our founder and chief executive officer  our chief financial officer  our senior vice president of worldwide sales  and our founder and chief technology officer 
these departures may cause other employees to leave the company 
we have and are initiating a number of employee retention programs  but we cannot assure you that these will be successful 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring desired personnel  particularly engineers and sales personnel  could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives  such as new product introductions 
in addition  companies in the networking industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
we have from time to time been involved in claims like this with other companies and  although to date they have not resulted in material litigation  we do not know whether we will be involved in additional claims in the future as we seek to hire and retain qualified personnel or that such claims will not result in material litigation 
we could incur substantial costs in litigating any such claims  regardless of the merits 
the market in which we compete is subject to rapid technological progress and to compete we must continually introduce new products that achieve broad market acceptance 
the network equipment market is characterized by rapid technological progress  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
if we do not regularly introduce new products in this dynamic environment  our product lines will become obsolete 
developments in routers and routing software could also significantly reduce demand for our products 
alternative technologies could achieve widespread market acceptance and displace the ethernet technology on which we have based our product architecture 
we cannot assure you that our technological approach will achieve broad market acceptance or that other technologies or devices will not supplant our own products and technology 
when we announce new products or product enhancements that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing products  customers may defer or cancel orders for our existing products 
these actions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results by unexpectedly decreasing sales  increasing inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence 
the market for switching products is evolving and we believe our ability to compete successfully in this market is dependent upon the continued compatibility and interoperability of our products with products and architectures offered by other vendors 
we have experienced delays in releasing new products and product enhancements in the past that resulted in lower quarterly revenue than anticipated 
we may experience similar delays in product development and releases in the future  and any delay in product introduction could adversely affect our ability to compete  causing our operating results to be below our expectations or the expectations of public market analysts or investors 

table of contents our limited ability to protect our intellectual property may adversely affect our ability to compete 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
however  we cannot ensure that the actions we have taken will adequately protect our intellectual property rights or that other parties will not independently develop similar or competing products that do not infringe on our patents 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and control access to and distribution of our intellectual property and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise misappropriate or use our products or technology  which would adversely affect our ability to compete 
claims of infringement by others may increase and the resolution of such claims may adversely affect our ability to compete and our operating results 
our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patents  copyrights  including rights to open source software  and other intellectual property rights 
because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field  the secrecy of some pending patents and the issuance of new patents at a rapid pace  it is not possible to determine in advance if a product or component might infringe the patent rights of others 
because of the potential for courts awarding substantial damages and the lack of predictability of such awards  it is not uncommon for companies in our and similar industries to settle even potentially unmeritorious claims for very substantial amounts 
we expect to increasingly be subject to infringement claims asserted by third parties as the numbers of products and competitors in the market for network switches grow and product functionality overlaps 
in addition  products or technologies acquired by us may include so called open source software 
open source software is typically licensed for use at no initial charge  but imposes on the user of the open source software certain requirements to license to others both the open source software as well as the software that relates to  or interacts with  the open source software 
our use of open source software subjects us to certain additional risks for the following reasons open source license terms may be ambiguous and may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our products  open source software cannot be protected under trade secret law  and it may be difficult for us to accurately determine the developers of the open source code and whether the acquired software infringes third party intellectual property rights 
we are actively involved in disputes and licensing discussions with  and have received notices from  third parties regarding their claimed proprietary rights 
as the functionality and features of our products expands these disputes and discussions could increase or become harder to resolve 
the corporations with whom we have or could have disputes or discussions include corporations with extensive patent portfolios and substantial financial assets who are actively engaged in programs to generate substantial revenues from their patent portfolios  and who are seeking or may seek significant payments or royalties from us and others in our industry 
we cannot ensure that we will always be able successfully to defend ourselves against such claims or conclude licensing discussions on favorable terms 
if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others  or if we otherwise settle such claims or enter into licensing arrangement to resolve potential disputes  we could be compelled to pay damages  royalties or other payments and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights 
any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all 
similarly  changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical 
litigation resulting from claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others has resulted and could in the future result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
due to the number of companies with extensive patent portfolios in our industry who are or may be actively involved in 
table of contents licensing programs  as well as the increasing number of trade secret and open source disputes  we believe that even if we do not infringe the rights of others  we will incur significant expenses in the future due to disputes or licensing negotiations  though the amounts can not be determined 
we cannot assure you that any such expenses will not be material or otherwise adversely affect our operating results 
we are engaged in litigation regarding intellectual property rights  and an adverse outcome could harm our business and require us to incur significant costs 
we have received notice from some companies alleging that we may be infringing their patents 
one company  enterasys networks  inc  recently filed a claim against us alleging patent infringement 
we are evaluating the merits of the claim and have filed counter claims in the matter 
without regard to the merits of this or any other claim  if judgments by a court of law on this or any other claim received in the future were to be upheld  or if we were otherwise to agree to the settlement of such claims  the consequences to us may be severe and could require us  among other actions to stop selling our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain a royalty bearing license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or available at all  pay damages  or redesign those products that use the disputed technology 
if we are compelled to take any of the foregoing actions  our business could be severely harmed 
we must continue to develop and increase the productivity of our indirect distribution channels to increase net revenues and improve our operating results 
our distribution strategy focuses primarily on developing and increasing the productivity of our indirect distribution channels 
if we fail to develop and cultivate relationships with significant resellers  or if these resellers are not successful in their sales efforts  sales of our products may decrease and our operating results could suffer 
many of our resellers also sell products from other vendors that compete with our products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into additional reseller and or distribution agreements or that we will be able to successfully manage our product sales channels 
our failure to do any of these could limit our ability to grow or sustain revenue 
in addition  our operating results will likely fluctuate significantly depending on the timing and amount of orders from our resellers 
we cannot assure you that our resellers and or distributors will continue to market or sell our products effectively or continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales  marketing and technical support 
most of our revenue is derived from sales of three product families  so we are dependent on widespread market acceptance of these products 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from sales of our summit  blackdiamond and alpine products and related services 
we expect that revenue from these product families will account for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  widespread market acceptance of our product families is vital to our future success 
factors that may affect the sales of our products  some of which are beyond our control  include the demand for switching products gigabit ethernet and layer switching technologies in particular in the enterprise and service provider markets  the performance  price and total cost of ownership of our products  the availability and price of competing products and technologies  
table of contents our ability to match supply with demand for certain products  and the success and development of our resellers  distributors and field sales channels 
we may not be able to achieve widespread market acceptance of our product families  which could reduce our revenue 
our reliance on industry standards  technological change in the marketplace and new product initiatives may cause our sales to fluctuate or decline 
the network equipment industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid changes in technology and customers requirements and evolving industry standards 
as a result  our success depends on the timely adoption and market acceptance of industry standards  and timely resolution of conflicting us and international industry standards  and our ability to influence the development of emerging industry standards and to introduce new and enhanced products that are compatible with such standards 
slow market acceptance of new technologies  products or industry standards could adversely affect our sales or overall results of operations 
in addition  if our technology is not included in an industry standard on a timely basis or if we fail to achieve timely certification of compliance to industry standards for our products  our sales of such products or our results of operations could be adversely affected 
if a key reseller  distributor  or other significant customer cancels or delays a large purchase  our net revenues may decline and the price of our stock may fall 
to date  a limited number of resellers  distributors and other customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue 
one distributor  tech data  accounted for greater than of our net revenue in fiscal  and in addition  while no other distributor or customer has accounted for or more of revenue in the recent fiscal years  sales to several distributors represent a high percentage of our sales 
if any of our large customers stop or delay purchases  our revenue and profitability would be adversely affected 
our expense levels are based on our expectations as to future revenue and to a large extent are fixed in the short term  so a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to a significant reseller  distributor or other customer could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
although our largest customers may differ from period to period  we anticipate that our operating results for any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent on large orders from a relatively small number of customers 
while our financial performance depends on large orders from a limited number of key resellers  distributors and other significant customers  we do not have binding purchase commitments from any of them 
for example our service providers and enterprise customers can stop purchasing  and our resellers and distributors can stop marketing  our products at any time  our reseller agreements are non exclusive and are for one year terms  with no obligation upon the resellers to renew the agreements  and our reseller  distributor and end user customer agreements generally do not require minimum purchases 
under specified conditions  some third party distributors are allowed to return products to us 
we do not recognize revenue on sales to distributors until the distributors sell the product to their customers 

table of contents the sales cycle for our products is long and we may incur substantial non recoverable expenses or devote significant resources to sales that do not occur when anticipated 
the use of indirect sales channels may contribute to the length and variability of our sales cycle 
our products represent a significant strategic decision by a customer regarding its communications infrastructure 
the decision by customers to purchase our products is often based on the results of a variety of internal procedures associated with the evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance of new technologies 
accordingly  the product evaluation process frequently results in a lengthy sales cycle  typically ranging from three months to longer than a year  and as a result  our ability to sell products is subject to a number of significant risks  including the risk that budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews by customers will result in the loss of potential sales  the risk of substantial variation in the length of the sales cycle from customer to customer  making decisions on the expenditure of resources difficult to assess  the risk that we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management time in an attempt to initiate or increase the sale of products to customers  but not succeed  the risk that  if a sales forecast from a specific customer for a particular quarter is not achieved in that quarter  we may be unable to compensate for the shortfall  which could harm our operating results  and the risk that downward pricing pressures could occur during this lengthy sales cycle 
we purchase several key components for products from single or limited sources and could lose sales if these suppliers fail to meet our needs 
we currently purchase several key components used in the manufacture of our products from single or limited sources and are dependent upon supply from these sources to meet our needs 
certain components such as tantalum capacitors  static random access memory  or sram  dynamic random access memory  or dram  and printed circuit boards  have been in the past  and may in the future be  in short supply 
we have encountered  and are likely in the future to encounter  shortages and delays in obtaining these or other components  and this could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer orders 
our principal sole source components include asics  microprocessors  programmable integrated circuits  selected other integrated circuits  custom power supplies  and custom tooled sheet metal 
our principal limited source components include flash memories  drams  srams and cams  and printed circuit boards 
we use our forecast of expected demand to determine our material requirements 
lead times for materials and components we order vary significantly  and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
if forecasts exceed orders  we may have excess and or obsolete 
table of contents inventory on hand or under non cancelable purchase commitments that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
if orders exceed forecasts  we may have inadequate supplies of certain materials and components  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we do not have agreements fixing long term prices or minimum volume requirements from suppliers 
from time to time we have experienced shortages and allocations of certain components  resulting in delays in filling orders 
qualifying new suppliers to compensate for such shortages may be time consuming and costly  and may increase the likelihood of errors in design or production 
in addition  during the development of our products  we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our chipsets  which in turn has led to delays in product introductions 
we cannot ensure that similar delays will not occur in the future 
furthermore  we cannot ensure that the performance of the components as incorporated in our products will meet the quality requirements of our customers 
our dependence on two contract manufacturers for all of our manufacturing requirements could harm our operating results 
if the demand for our products grows  we will need to increase our material purchases  contract manufacturing capacity  and internal test and quality functions 
any disruptions in product flow could limit our revenue  adversely affect our competitive position and reputation  and result in additional costs or cancellation of orders under agreements with our customers 
we rely on two independent contractors to manufacture all of our products 
flextronics international  ltd 
manufactures products for one of our product lines 
this company s facilities are located in san jose  california and guadalajara  mexico 
our commitment with flextronics is formalized through a one year contract 
alpha networks  located in hsinchu  taiwan  manufactures products for our second product line 
we have experienced delays in product shipments from contract manufacturers in the past  which in turn delayed product shipments to our customers 
these or similar problems may arise in the future  such as products of inferior quality  insufficient quantity of products  or the interruption or discontinuance of operations of a manufacturer  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we do not know whether we will effectively manage our contract manufacturers or that these manufacturers will meet our future requirements for timely delivery of products of sufficient quality and quantity 
we intend to introduce new products and product enhancements  which will require that we rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating our efforts with those of our suppliers and contract manufacturers 
the inability of our contract manufacturer to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders and may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
moreover  our current dependence on two manufacturers makes us particularly vulnerable to these risks 
as part of our cost reduction efforts  we will need to realize lower per unit product costs from our contract manufacturers by means of volume efficiencies and the utilization of manufacturing sites in lower cost geographies 
however  we cannot be certain when or if such price reductions will occur 
the failure to obtain such price reductions would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
if we do not adequately manage and evolve our financial reporting and managerial systems and processes  our ability to manage and grow our business may be harmed 
our ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with regulations requires an effective planning and management process 
we need to continue improving our existing  and implement new  operational and financial systems  procedures and controls 
any delay in the implementation of  or disruption in the transition to  new or enhanced systems  procedures or controls  could harm our ability to record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis  or to forecast future results 

table of contents we may be unable to reasonably anticipate whether a change in our process will have a material affect on our internal control over financial reporting 
as we improve our controls and procedures in our ongoing effort to improve our business systems  we may be required to make changes to our internal control over financial reporting 
we may be unable to reasonably anticipate  both during the period in which such changes are made and at the time we file the periodic reports covering such period  that such changes will have a material affect on our internal control over financial reporting 
if we are unable to reasonably anticipate such material affect  it will have an adverse effect on our ability to accurately report our changes in internal control over financial reporting 
changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 
a change in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
new pronouncements and varying interpretations of existing pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules  or changes to the interpretations of existing rules could lead to the questioning of our accounting practices  which may cause us to reevaluate or change such practices  and such changes could adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
in particular  in december the financial accounting standards board issued a statement requiring companies to record stock option grants as compensation expense in their income statements 
this statement was effective beginning with the first quarter of our fiscal the methodology for expensing such stock options is based on  among other things  the historical volatility of the underlying stock and the expected life of our stock options 
our stock price has been historically volatile 
therefore  the adoption of this accounting standard has  and will continue to  negatively impact our profitability and may adversely impact our stock price 
in addition  our adoption of this standard could limit our ability to continue to use stock options as an incentive and retention tool  which could  in turn  hurt our ability to recruit employees and retain existing employees 
in addition  various accounting rules and regulations have been established over the recent past relating to revenue recognition 
these regulations frequently require judgments in their application  and are subject to numerous subsequent clarifications and interpretations  some of which may require changes in the way we recognize revenue and may require restatement of prior period revenue and results  either of which could adversely affect our reported results 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq stock market rules  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we are investing all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards and changing interpretations of existing standards and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities and efforts to evaluate current practices and achieve compliance 
we have been named as a defendant in a shareholder class action lawsuit arising out of our public offerings of securities in and may be involved in additional litigation in the future 
beginning on july   purported securities fraud class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the cases were consolidated and the litigation is now captioned as in re extreme networks  inc initial public offering securities litigation  civ 
no 
sas sdny  related to in re initial public offering securities litigation  mc sas sdny the 
table of contents operative amended complaint is brought purportedly on behalf of all persons who purchased extreme networks common stock from april  through december  it names as defendants extreme networks  six of our present and former officers and or directors  including our ceo the extreme networks defendants  and several investment banking firms that served as underwriters of our initial public offering and october secondary offering 
see other matters in item legal proceedings we cannot assure you that we will prevail in the lawsuit 
failure to prevail could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in the future 
in addition  in the past  we have  and may in the future  become subject to other types of litigation  and may in the future become subject to other types of litigation 
litigation is often expensive and diverts management s attention and resources  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
our headquarters and some significant supporting businesses are located in northern california and other areas subject to natural disasters that could disrupt our operations and harm our business 
our corporate headquarters are located in silicon valley in northern california 
historically  this region has been vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks  such as earthquakes  fires and floods  which at times have disrupted the local economy and posed physical risks to our property 
we have contract manufacturers located in northern california  mexico and taiwan where similar natural disasters and other risks may disrupt the local economy and pose physical risks to our property and the property of our contract manufacturer 
in addition  the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat  or any future acts of terrorism  may cause further disruptions to the economies of the us and other countries 
if such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders for our products  our business and operating results will suffer 
we currently do not have redundant  multiple site capacity in the event of a natural disaster  terrorist act or other catastrophic event 
in the event of such an occurrence  our business would suffer 
failure of our products to comply with evolving industry standards and complex government regulations may cause our products to not be widely accepted  which may prevent us from growing our net revenues or achieving profitability on a fiscal year basis 
the market for network equipment products is characterized by the need to support industry standards as different standards emerge  evolve and achieve acceptance 
we will not be competitive unless we continually introduce new products and product enhancements that meet these emerging standards 
in the past  we have introduced new products that were not compatible with certain technological standards  and in the future we may not be able to effectively address the compatibility and interoperability issues that arise as a result of technological changes and evolving industry standards 
our products must comply with various united states federal government regulations and standards defined by agencies such as the federal communications commission  in addition to standards established by governmental authorities in various foreign countries and recommendations of the international telecommunication union 
if we do not comply with existing or evolving industry standards or if we fail to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates we will not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply  which may prevent us from sustaining our net revenue or achieving profitability on a fiscal year basis 
production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject us to environmental and other regulations including  in some instances  the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life  and place the responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with us 
additionally  certain states and countries may pass regulations requiring our products to meet certain requirements to use environmentally friendly components 
such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate  including the european union which issued a directive ec 
table of contents waste electrical and electronic equipment weee to mandate funding  collection  treatment  recycling and recovery of weee by producers of electrical or electronic equipment into europe 
china is in the final approval stage of compliance programs which will harmonize with the european union weee 
in the future  japan and other countries are expected to adopt environmental compliance programs 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  we may not be able to sell our products in jurisdictions where these regulations apply  which would have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
in addition  the eu also adopted directive ec on restriction on the certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the rohs directive 
the rohs directive bans in the eu the use of certain hazardous materials in electrical and electronic equipment 
the rohs directive went into effect on july   the date by which each eu member country was required to adopt legislation implementing the rohs directive in that country 
certain eu member countries where we import products have adopted such implementing legislation effective july   while other eu member countries have either not yet adopted implementing legislation or have not yet adopted rules under their implementing legislation 
the manner of implementation of the rohs directive in each eu country will likely vary  and we will face challenges complying with the differing implementation of the rohs directive in each country 
failure to comply with the regulatory requirements in one jurisdiction may adversely impact our ability to do business in that jurisdiction as well as others 
we have incurred higher manufacturing costs and increased our european service spare parts inventory by approximately million as of july  as a result of complying with the rohs directive 
during fiscal  we did not increase our european service spare parts inventory further as a result of complying with the rohs directive 
as of july   we were fully compliant with the rohs directive 
similar legislation has been or could be enacted in other countries outside the eu  the cumulative impact of which could similarly impact our financial condition or results of operations 
failure to successfully expand our sales and support teams or educate them in regard to technologies and our product families may harm our operating results 
the sale of our products and services requires a concerted effort that is frequently targeted at several levels within a prospective customer s organization 
we may not be able to increase net revenues unless we expand our sales and support teams in order to address all of the customer requirements necessary to sell our products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate employees into our company or to educate current and future employees in regard to rapidly evolving technologies and our product families 
a failure to do so may hurt our revenue growth and operating results 
we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders  cause us to incur debt and assume contingent liabilities 
as part of our business strategy  we review acquisition and strategic investment prospects that we believe would complement our current product offerings  augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities  or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
from time to time we review investments in new businesses and we expect to make investments in  and to acquire  businesses  products  or technologies in the future 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we could issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership  incur substantial debt  assume contingent liabilities  or expend significant cash 
these actions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or the price of our common stock 
moreover  even if we do obtain benefits in the form of increased sales and earnings  there may be a lag 
table of contents between the time when the expenses associated with an acquisition are incurred and the time when we recognize such benefits 
this is particularly relevant in cases where it is necessary to integrate new types of technology into our existing portfolio and new types of products may be targeted for potential customers with which we do not have pre existing relationships 
acquisitions and investment activities also entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies and or products  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition or investment transaction  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  the potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations  and substantial charges for the amortization of certain purchased intangible assets  deferred stock compensation or similar items 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies  or personnel that we might acquire in the future  and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may need additional capital to fund our future operations and  if it is not available when needed  we may need to reduce our planned development and marketing efforts  which may reduce our net revenues and prevent us from achieving profitability on a fiscal year basis 
we believe that our existing working capital and cash available from credit facilities and future operations will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  if cash from future operations is insufficient  or if cash is used for acquisitions or other currently unanticipated uses  we may need additional capital 
the development and marketing of new products and the expansion of reseller and distribution channels and associated support personnel requires a significant commitment of resources 
in addition  if the markets for our products develop more slowly than anticipated  or if we fail to establish significant market share and achieve sufficient net revenues  we may continue to consume significant amounts of capital 
as a result  we could be required to raise additional capital 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of the shares held by existing stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  such securities may provide the holders certain rights  preferences  and privileges senior to those of common stockholders  and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
we cannot assure you that additional capital  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
we have entered into long term lease agreements for several facilities that are currently vacant and may be difficult to sublease due to current real estate market conditions 
we have certain long term real estate lease commitments carrying future obligations for non cancelable lease payments 
reductions in our workforce and the restructuring of operations since fiscal have resulted in the need to consolidate certain of these leased facilities  located primarily in northern california  for which we recorded excess facilities charges of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal for more information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we may incur additional charges for excess facilities as a result of additional reductions in our workforce or future restructuring of operations 
we will continue to be responsible for all carrying costs of these facilities until such time as we can sublease these facilities or terminate the applicable 
table of contents leases based on the contractual terms of the lease agreements  and these costs may have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our stock price has been volatile in the past and our stock price may significantly fluctuate in the future 
in the past  our common stock price has fluctuated significantly 
this could continue as we or our competitors announce new products  our results or those of our customers or competition fluctuate  conditions in the networking or semiconductor industry change  or when investors  change their sentiment toward stocks in the networking technology sector 
in addition  fluctuations in our stock price and our price to earnings multiple may make our stock attractive to momentum  hedge or day trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stock rapidly  exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction  particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law and our adoption of a stockholder rights plan may delay or prevent an acquisition of extreme  which could decrease the value of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer 
although we believe these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law and our stockholder rights plan  which is described below  will provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some of our stockholders 
our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan  pursuant to which we declared and paid a dividend of one right for each share of common stock held by stockholders of record as of may  under the plan  each right will entitle stockholders to purchase a fractional share of our preferred stock for 
each such fractional share of the new preferred stock has terms designed to make it substantially the economic equivalent of one share of common stock 
initially the rights will not be exercisable and will trade with our common stock 
generally  the rights may become exercisable if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer upon consummation of which such person or group would beneficially own or more of our common stock 
when the rights become exercisable  our board of directors has the right to authorize the issuance of one share of our common stock in exchange for each right that is then exercisable

unresolved staff comments not applicable 
item properties our principal administrative  sales  marketing and research and development facilities are located in santa clara  california 
we also lease office space and executive suites in various other geographic locations domestically and internationally for sales and service personnel and engineering operations 
our aggregate lease expense for fiscal was approximately million  net of sublease income of approximately million 
we believe our current facilities will adequately meet our growth needs for the foreseeable future  and we are actively engaged in efforts to sublease excess space we acquired in prior years to meet the anticipated growth at that time 

table of contents item legal proceedings government inquiries relating to historical stock option practices on june   the company received an informal inquiry letter from the staff of the sec enforcement division requesting that the company voluntarily provide documents related to its policies  practices and procedures for granting stock options for the period since its initial public offering on april  ipo 
the company responded to the request  is cooperating fully with the sec inquiry  and intends to continue to do so 
this inquiry likely will require the company to expend significant management time and incur significant legal and other expenses  and could result in civil actions seeking  among other things  injunctions against the company and the payment of significant fines and penalties by the company  which may adversely affect the company s results of operations and cash flow 
the company cannot predict how long it will take to or how much more time and resources the company will have to expend to resolve this government inquiry  nor can we predict the outcome of this inquiry 
also  there can be no assurance that other inquiries  investigations or actions will not be started by other united states federal or state regulatory agencies or by foreign governmental agencies

those filings were made on june  on july   the company received a written notice from the nasdaq stock market stating that the nasdaq listing and hearing review council the listing council had determined that as of that date the company had demonstrated compliance with all nasdaq marketplace rules 
on july   the company received a further staff determination notice from the nasdaq stock market stating that the company was not in compliance with nasdaq s marketplace rule e due to a failure by the company to hold its annual meeting of shareholders within the time required by rule e 
on july   the company had held an annual meeting of shareholders and subsequently received a written notice from the panel confirming that the company had demonstrated compliance with all nasdaq marketplace rules  and that the panel determined to continue the listing of the company s securities on the nasdaq stock market 
accordingly  the company believes that the nasdaq delisting proceedings have concluded 
we cannot predict  however  whether the sec will review these reports and  if so  whether the sec will have comments on these reports or other reports that we previously filed that may require us to file amended reports with the sec 
in addition  we cannot predict whether the nasdaq listing qualifications panel or listing council will concur that we are in compliance with all relevant listing requirements 
if either of those events occurs  we might be unable to remain in compliance with sec reporting requirements and nasdaq listing requirements  and  therefore  we might be unable to maintain an effective listing of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market or any other national securities exchange

in addition  our gross margin may fluctuate due to the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold  including the effects of our two tier distribution model 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and sales functions  as well as trade shows and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing an increase of in fiscal from fiscal  and an increase of in fiscal from fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in salaries  benefits and commission expenses of million due to a higher average headcount and employee retention program expenses and an increase in contract labor of million  offset by decreases in professional fees of million and share based compensation expense of million 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to share based compensation expense of million  increased information technology costs of million  increased outsourcing of the service contract renewal process expenses of million  increased expenses of million from the inclusion of an additional department to better align costs with current functional activities  which in fiscal were included under general administrative expenses  offset by million lower compensation costs due to lower average headcount in our sales force 
as a percentage of net revenues  sales and marketing expenses were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the level of our sales and marketing spending in the future  in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues will depend on many factors  including the rate at which we expand our sales force and the rate at which our net revenues change 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and related personnel expenses  consultant fees and prototype expenses related to the design  development  and testing of our products 
research and development expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to million increase in employee related expenses as a result of increased headcount  offset by a decrease of million in the avaya warrant amortization cost 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to share based compensation expense of million and increased engineering project expenses of million  offset by million lower warrant amortization expense and million related to all other research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include 
table of contents million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  in amortization expense related to the fair value of the warrant issued to avaya as part of the joint development agreement 
the fair value of the warrant allocated to the joint development agreement with avaya is million and is being amortized over the term of the agreement see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in the warrant amortization in fiscal compared to fiscal and is due to an extension of the development agreement with avaya signed in fiscal as a percentage of total net revenues  research and development expenses were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal we expense all research and development expenses as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives and as a result  we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  legal fees  professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing an increase of in fiscal from fiscal  and a decrease of in fiscal from fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to million related to the costs of the special investigation into our historical stock option granting practices  million in legal fees related to defending claims related to our intellectual property and a shareholder derivative lawsuit related to our historical stock option granting practices  offset by a decrease of million in bad debt expense recognized in the decrease in fiscal from fiscal of million was primarily due to a million decrease in legal expenses as fiscal included litigation to defend our intellectual property rights 
as a percentage of net revenues  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal future general and administrative expense levels will depend significantly on the level of legal expenses related to intellectual property litigation and shareholder derivative lawsuit 
technology agreement on march   we entered into a patent and cross license agreement technology agreement with ibm 
the agreement provides for a release of prior claims and a cross license of patents extending into the future from the effective date of the agreement 
we charged the estimated value of the release of prior claims of million to operating expenses in the year ended july  under the caption technology agreement 
the remaining costs payable under the technology agreement will be charged to cost of product revenue over the license term 
we expect these costs to have a small impact on the total product cost of revenue 
amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of deferred stock compensation in accordance with apb was zero in fiscal and fiscal and million in fiscal  representing no change in fiscal from fiscal  and a decrease of million in fiscal from fiscal amortization of deferred stock compensation is attributable to unvested stock options subject to forfeiture issued to employees that we assumed in conjunction with acquisitions during fiscal deferred stock compensation was amortized as charges to operations  using the graded method  over the vesting periods of the individual stock options  generally four years 
upon termination of an employee  the amount of expense recognized under the graded vesting method that is in excess of the amount actually earned is reversed 
for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal there was no reversal of excess compensation expense related to terminated employees 
the deferred stock compensation was fully amortized at the end of fiscal restructuring charge during fiscal and  we recorded restructuring charges of million  and million  respectively 
the charges in fiscal included million in the first through third quarters to rationalize our 
table of contents sales force in japan  and million in the fourth quarter to reduce headcount across several functional areas  terminate certain redundant contracts  and to exit an excess facility 
we expect to reduce annual operating costs by million to million in fiscal as a result of the june restructuring charge 
the charge in fiscal was for an excess facilities charge and represented an increase to the charge initially recognized during the third quarter of fiscal the commercial real estate market continued to deteriorate in fiscal and we were not able to find suitable tenants to sublease these facilities necessitating an additional charge due to lower projected sublease receipts 
interest income interest income was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing a decrease of million in fiscal from fiscal  and an increase of million in fiscal from fiscal the decrease in interest income in fiscal from fiscal was due primarily to a decrease in funds available for investment as a result of our retiring million in convertible subordinated notes 
the increase in interest income in fiscal from fiscal was due primarily to an increase in average interest rates 
interest expense interest expense was million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively

other income in fiscal includes income of million from the relief of a foreign consumption tax obligation  expense of million for amortization of the costs associated with the convertible subordinated notes  and million of foreign exchange losses due primarily to the decline in the us dollar relative to the yen and the euro 
the tax holiday that generated the foreign consumption tax relief expired in fiscal  and no further benefits are expected 
provision benefit for income taxes the provisions for income taxes of million for fiscal were recorded for taxes due on income generated in certain states and foreign tax jurisdictions

critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period reported 
by their nature  these estimates  assumptions and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience  market trends and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe the critical accounting policies stated below  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the year ended july  compared to the prior years 
share based payments on july   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  fas r 
prior to july   we accounted for share based payments under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations  as permitted by fasb statement no 
 accounting for share based compensation fas 
in accordance with apb no compensation cost was required to be recognized for options granted that had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
we adopted fas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation cost recognized in the year ended july  includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of fas  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r 
the results for the prior periods have not been restated 

table of contents share based compensation recognized in the financial statements by line item caption is as follows dollars in thousands year ended july  july  july  cost of product revenue cost of service revenue sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of deferred stock compensation total share based compensation expense share based compensation cost capitalized in inventory total share based compensation cost in accordance with fas r  the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option valuation model with the weighted average assumptions noted in the table in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
expected volatility is based on both the implied volatilities from traded options on our stock and historical volatility on our stock 
for options granted prior to july   and valued on a pro forma basis in accordance with fas  the expected volatility used to estimate the fair value of the options was based solely on the historical volatility on our stock  we used the graded vesting method for expense attribution  and we recognized option forfeitures as they occurred as allowed by fas for options granted after july   and valued in accordance with fas r  the expected volatility used to estimate the fair value of the options was based on a combination of the historical volatility on our stock and the implied volatility  we used the straight line method for expense attribution and we estimate forfeitures and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
our estimated forfeiture rate in fiscal  based on our historical forfeiture experience  is approximately 
we modified our estimated forfeiture rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal and recognized the cumulative effect of the change  as an increase in compensation expense  in that quarter of approximately million 
the black scholes merton option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based award and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based compensation represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  our share based compensation expense could have been materially different 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be materially different 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the compensation committee of the board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting of certain unvested stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share previously awarded to employees  including executive officers  and directors 
options to purchase approximately  shares of common stock were subject to acceleration 
in accordance with apb  no compensation expense was required to be recorded in our consolidated statement of operations in fiscal in 
table of contents connection with the acceleration of the vesting of these options  as the exercise price of the employee stock options was higher than the market price of our stock on the date of the modification of the options 
we believe that such options had limited economic value and were not offering sufficient incentive to the employees when compared to the potential future expense of approximately million that would have been required to be recorded in future periods under fas r had the options not been accelerated 
revenue recognition we derive the majority of our revenue from sales of our modular and stackable networking equipment  with the remaining revenue generated from service fees relating to the service contracts and training on our products 
we generally recognize product revenue from our value added resellers and end user customers at the time of shipment  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price of the product is fixed or determinable and collection of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured 
in instances where the criteria for revenue recognition are not met  revenue is deferred until all criteria have been met 
our total deferred product revenue was million and million as of july  and july   respectively 
revenue from service obligations under service contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual service period 
our total deferred revenue for services  primarily from service contracts  was million and million as of july  and july   respectively 
service contracts typically range from one to five years 
when sales arrangements contain multiple deliverables  such as hardware  service contracts and other services  we determine whether the deliverables represent separate units of accounting and then allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on their relative fair values 
we recognize revenue for each unit of accounting when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met 
the amount of product revenue recognized is impacted by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple units of accounting and if so  whether fair value exists for those units of accounting 
the ability to establish fair value for any unit of accounting could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 
we make certain sales to partners in two distribution channels  or tiers 
the first tier consists of a limited number of independent distributors that sell primarily to resellers and  on occasion  to end user customers 
we defer recognition of revenue on all sales to these distributors until the distributors sell the product  as evidenced by monthly sales out reports that the distributors provide to us 
we grant these distributors the right to return a portion of unsold inventory to us for the purpose of stock rotation 
we also grant these distributors certain price protection rights 
the distributor related deferred revenue and receivables are adjusted at the time of the stock rotation return or price reduction 
we also provide distributors with credits for changes in selling prices  and allow them to participate in cooperative marketing programs 
we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these exposures based upon our historical experience 
if actual credits to distributors for changes in selling prices and cooperative marketing programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates  which are based on contractual arrangements and historical experience  our future revenue could be adversely affected 
the second tier of the distribution channel consists of a large number of third party value added resellers that sell directly to end users and are generally not granted return privileges  except for defective products during the warranty period 
we reduce product revenue for certain price protection rights that may occur under contractual arrangements we have with our resellers 
we provide an allowance for sales returns based on our historical returns  analysis of credit memo data and our return policies 
the allowance for sales returns was million and million as of july  and july   respectively  for estimated future returns that were recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable 
the provision for returns is charged to net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  and was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal if the historical data we use to calculate the estimated sales returns and allowances does not properly reflect future levels of product returns  these estimates will be revised  thus resulting in an impact on future net revenues 
we estimate and adjust this allowance at each balance sheet date 

table of contents inventory valuation our inventory balance was million as of july   compared with million as of july  we value our inventory at lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or replacement cost 
the networking industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
we perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes a review of  among other factors  demand requirements  product lifecycle and product development plans and quality issues 
based on this analysis  we record adjustments  when appropriate  to reflect inventory at net realizable value 
inventory write downs charged to cost of product revenue were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments would significantly impact the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
in the future  if we find that our estimates are too optimistic and we determine that our inventory needs to be written down  we will be required to recognize such costs in our cost of product revenue at the time of such determination 
conversely  if we find our estimates are too pessimistic and we subsequently sell product that has previously been written down  our operating margin in that period will be favorably impacted 
accrued warranty networking products may contain undetected hardware or software errors when new products or new versions or updates of existing products are released to the marketplace 
we have experienced such errors in connection with products and product updates 
our standard hardware warranty period is typically months from the date of shipment to end users and days for software 
upon shipment of products to our customers  including both end users and channel partners  we estimate expenses for the cost to repair or replace products that may be returned under warranty and accrue a liability through charges to cost of product revenue for this amount 
our accrued warranty balance was million as of july   compared with million as of july  the determination of our warranty requirements is based on our actual historical experience with the product or product family  estimates of repair and replacement costs and any product warranty problems that are identified after shipment 
we estimate and adjust this accrual at each balance sheet date in accordance with changes in these factors 
the cost of new warranties issued that was charged to cost of product revenue was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal while we believe that our warranty accrual is adequate and that the judgments applied in calculating this accrual are appropriate  the assumptions used are based on estimates and these estimated amounts could differ materially from our actual warranty expenses in the future 
in fiscal  we recognized million in additional warranty expense due to a change in the method we use to accumulate the warranty return rates 
if actual expenses exceed those we have estimated  our future cost of product revenue would be adversely affected 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was million and million as of july  and july   respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts for trade accounts receivable as of july  was million  compared with million as of july  the distributor accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets  was million and million as of july  and july   respectively 
the allowance for doubtful distributor accounts  also recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets  as of july  was million  compared with million as of july  we continually monitor and evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors 
we record specific allowances for bad debts in general and administrative expense when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration of financial position 
estimates are used in determining our allowances for all other customers based on factors such 
table of contents as current trends in the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
we mitigate some collection risk by requiring most of our customers in the asia pacific region  excluding japan and australia  to pay cash in advance or secure letters of credit when placing an order with us 
our provision for doubtful accounts was an expense of million in fiscal  expense of million in fiscal and an expense of million in fiscal if a major customer s creditworthiness deteriorates  or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  or if other circumstances arise  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  and additional allowances could be required 
we write off receivables to the allowance after all collection efforts are exhausted 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  one large distributor in europe became delinquent in its payments to us due to cash flow problems and difficulty in obtaining financing 
we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts to cover a higher percentage of this customer s outstanding balance in fiscal and ultimately wrote off million in receivables in fiscal deferred tax asset valuation allowance we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required in determining our valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we make an assessment of the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that recovery is not believed to be likely  a valuation allowance is established 
we provided a full valuation allowance against all of our us federal and state net deferred tax assets in fiscal in the amount of million in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in fiscal  the valuation allowance increased by million to million  and in fiscal  the valuation allowance decreased by million to million 
the valuation allowance is determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas  which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
in accordance with sfas  evidence  such as operating results during the most recent three year period at the time the charge was incurred  was given more weight than our expectations of future profitability  which is inherently uncertain 
our losses during those periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets under sfas this valuation allowance will be evaluated periodically and can be reversed partially or totally if business results have sufficiently improved to support realization of our deferred tax assets 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings  including negotiations regarding potential licenses from third parties who have notified us that they believe our products may infringe certain patents 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter  whether litigation or licensing negotiation  and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals  if any  are based only on the most current and dependable information available at any given time 
as additional information becomes available  we may reassess the potential liability from pending claims and litigation and the probability of claims being successfully asserted against us 
as a result  we may revise our estimates related to these pending claims and litigation 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows in the future

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities were million and million at july  and july   respectively  representing a decrease of million

cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal  a decline of million compared to cash from operations of million in fiscal the decline in cash from operating activities was primarily due to net loss in fiscal of million  which included significant non cash charges  including depreciation and amortization of million  share based compensation expense of million  and amortization expense related to the warrant issued to avaya of million 
accounts receivable  net  decreased to million at july  from million at july  days sales outstanding in receivables decreased to days at july  from days at july  the decrease in accounts receivable and decrease in days sales outstanding were primarily due to improved collection efforts 
inventories increased to million at july  from million at july  inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times and avoid stock outs with the risk of inventory excess or obsolescence because of declining demand  rapidly changing technology  environmental regulations and customer requirements 
deferred revenue decreased to million at july  from million at july  this decrease was due primarily to lower service contracts booked as a result of lower product sales 
we have a revolving line of credit for million with a major lending institution 
as of july   there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility 
the line of credit contains a provision for the issuance of letters of credit not to exceed the unused balance of the line 
at july   we had letters of credit totaling million 
these letters of credit were primarily issued to satisfy requirements of certain of our customers for performance bonds 
the line of credit requires us to maintain specified financial covenants related to tangible net worth and liquidity with which we were in compliance as of july  the line of credit was renewed on january  and expires on january  it is our intention to renew this line of credit when it expires 
in december  we completed a private placement of million of convertible subordinated notes 
the notes matured on december  interest was payable semi annually at per annum 
the notes were paid off on their maturity date of december  on october   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
in fiscal  we repurchased approximately million shares for approximately million bringing the cumulative total to million repurchased shares for approximately million 
in fiscal  we repurchased approximately million shares for approximately million 
the repurchases were made in compliance with the securities and exchange commission s rule b  and were subject to market conditions as well as applicable legal and other considerations 
in october  the board of directors terminated the share repurchase program 
we own our corporate headquarters in santa clara  california 
the campus is located on approximately acres of property in an area that may ultimately be suitable for residential development 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations including interest payments at july   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations non cancelable inventory purchase commitments non cancelable operating lease obligations other non cancelable purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of july  other non cancelable purchase commitments represent oem and technology agreements 
we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of july  we require substantial capital to fund our business  particularly to finance inventories and accounts receivable and for capital expenditures 
as a result  we could be required to raise substantial additional capital at any time 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to existing stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
if we are unable to obtain such additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts  which would have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable securities and cash available from credit facilities and future operations will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  other non government debt securities and money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable securities and long term debt that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of july  and july  this table does not include money market funds because those funds are generally not subject to market risk

while we conduct some sales transactions and incur certain operating expenses in foreign currencies and expect to continue to do so  we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be significant  in part because of our foreign exchange risk management process discussed below
