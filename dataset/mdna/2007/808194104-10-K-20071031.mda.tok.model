the foregoing descriptions of certain of the terms of the agreement and the agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the agreements  each of which are attached as exhibit to the forms k filed by the company on october  and october  critical accounting policies the company has identified critical accounting policies that  as a result of the judgments  uncertainties  and the operations involved  could result in material changes to its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the company s most critical accounting policies relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserve  restructuring charges  purchase accounting and goodwill  long lived assets  income taxes  pension and other postretirement benefits and stock based compensation 
allowance for doubtful accounts management records an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on the current and projected credit quality of the company s customers  historical experience  customer payment history  expected trends and other factors that affect collectibility 
changes in these factors or changes in economic circumstances could result in changes to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory reserve management establishes an inventory reserve based on historical experience and amounts expected to be realized for slow moving and obsolete inventory 
the company monitors its slow moving and obsolete inventory on a quarterly basis and makes adjustments as considered necessary 
the proceeds from the sale or dispositions of these inventories may differ from the net recorded amount 

table of contents restructuring charges restructuring charges are recorded in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
liabilities for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are recognized when the liability is incurred 
fair value is the basis for the measurement of any asset write downs that are recorded in accordance with sfas  accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
estimated remaining useful lives are the basis for the measurement of any adjustments that are reflected as accelerated depreciation in cost of sales in accordance with sfas purchase accounting and goodwill business acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
this method requires the company to record assets and liabilities of the business acquired at their estimated fair market values as of the acquisition date 
any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the company uses valuation specialists to perform appraisals and assist in the determination of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
these valuations require management to make estimates and assumptions that are critical in determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities 
goodwill is not amortized 
the company conducts a formal impairment test of goodwill at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
long lived assets long lived assets  except goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable  or at least annually 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future net cash flows estimated by the company to be generated by such assets 
income taxes the company s provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of judgment by management 
this provision is impacted by the income and tax rates of the countries where the company operates 
a change in the geographical source of the company s income can have a significant effect on the tax rate 
no taxes are provided on earnings which are permanently reinvested 
various taxing authorities periodically audit the company s tax returns 
these audits may include questions regarding the company s tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions the company records tax liabilities for probable exposures 
a significant period of time may elapse before a particular matter  for which the company has recorded a tax liability  is audited and fully resolved 
the establishment of the company s tax liabilities relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with its various filing positions 
although management believes those estimates and judgments are reasonable  actual results could differ  resulting in gains or losses that may be material to the company s consolidated statement of income 
to the extent that the company prevails in matters for which tax liabilities have been recorded  or are required to pay amounts in excess of these tax liabilities  the company s effective tax rate in any given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement could result in an increase in the company s effective tax rate in the financial statement period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in the company s effective tax rate in the financial statement period of resolution 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for income taxes  all available evidence  both positive and negative  is considered to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed 
evidence  such as the results of operations for the current and preceding years  is given more weight than projections of future income  which is inherently uncertain 
the company s losses in the us in recent periods provide sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets in the us the company intends to maintain a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets in the us until sufficient positive evidence exists to support realization of such assets 

table of contents pension and other postretirement benefits defined pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business that represents obligations that will be ultimately settled far into the future and therefore subject to estimation 
pension and postretirement benefit accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate period of employment based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by the company 
while management believes the company s assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in the company s actual experience or significant changes in the company s assumptions  including the discount rate used and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  may materially affect the company s pension and postretirement obligations and future expenses 
the company has several postretirement benefit plans worldwide 
these plans consist primarily of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
for financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  many assumptions are required to be made in order to value the plans liabilities on a projected and accumulated basis  as well as to determine the annual expense for the plans 
the assumptions chosen take into account historical experience  the current economic environment and management s best judgment regarding future experience 
assumptions include the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on assets  future salary increases  health care escalation rates  cost of living increases  turnover  retirement ages and mortality 
the cumulative difference between actual experience and assumed experience is included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
these gains or losses are recognized in expense over the average future working lifetime of employees to the extent that the cumulative experience exceeds of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and assets 
additionally  the current accounting principles defer the amount of any plan changes 
these amounts are included in accumulated other comprehensive income and then recognized in expense over the average future working lifetime of the affected group 
with the adoption at august  of sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans  the full unfunded liability of all the company s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans were included on the company s consolidated balance sheet at august  for the majority of the company s pension plans  the company consults with various actuaries annually when reviewing and selecting the discount rates to be used 
the discount rates used by the company are based on yields of various corporate and governmental bond indices with varying maturity dates 
the discount rates are also reviewed in comparison with current benchmark indices  economic market conditions and the movement in the benchmark yield since the previous fiscal year 
the liability weighted average discount rate for the defined benefit pension plans is for fiscal for the other postretirement benefit plan  the rate is and is obtained from the citigroup pension liability index and discount curve 
this rate represents the higher interest rates generally available in the united states  which is the company s only country with other postretirement benefit liabilities 
another assumption that affects the company s pension expense is the expected long term rate of return on assets 
some of the company s plans are funded 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on assets assumption is for fiscal the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the assumed discount rate and expected long term rate of return on assets for the company s pension plans and other postretirement plans as of august  impact on impact on august  august  impact on projected benefit projected benefit obligation for obligation for change in assumption benefits expense pension plans postretirement plans in thousands basis point decrease in discount rate basis point increase in discount rate basis point decrease in expected long term rate of return on assets basis point increase in expected long term rate of return on assets stock based compensation stock based compensation requires the use of a valuation model 
the company currently uses a black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of its stock options 
the black scholes model requires assumptions based on 
table of contents management s judgment regarding  among others  the volatility of the company s stock  the expected forfeiture rate  the expected life of the stock award and the company s dividend yield 
the company primarily uses historical data to determine the assumptions to be used in the black scholes model and has no reason to believe that future data is likely to differ from historical data 
however  changes in the assumptions to reflect future stock price volatility  future dividend payments and future stock award exercise experience may result in a material change to the fair value calculation of share based awards 
while management believes the company s assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in the company s actual experience or significant changes in the company s assumptions  including the volatility of the company s stock  the expected forfeiture rate  the expected life of the stock award and the dividend yield  may materially affect the company s future stock based compensation expense 
the company grants certain types of restricted stock grants which involved market conditions for determining vesting 
these awards vest based on total shareholder return over a certain period compared to the shareholder return of other peer companies 
the concept of modeling is used with such awards because observable market prices for these types of awards are not available 
the modeling technique that is generally considered to most appropriately value this type of award is the monte carlo simulation 
these models are considered to be a more refined estimate of fair value for awards with market conditions than the black scholes model 
the monte carlo simulation requires assumptions based on management s judgment regarding  among others  the volatility of the company s stock  the expected forfeiture rate  the correlation rate of the company s stock price compared to peer companies and the company s dividend yield 
the company uses historical data to determine the assumptions to be used in the monte carlo simulation and has no reason to believe that future data is likely to differ from historical data 
however  changes in the assumptions to reflect future stock price volatility  future dividend payments  future forfeitures and future correlation experience may result in a material change to the fair value calculation of share based awards 
while management believes the company s assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in the company s actual experience or significant changes in the company s assumptions  including the volatility of the company s stock  the expected forfeiture rate  the expected life of the stock award  the correlation rate and the dividend yield  may materially affect the company s future stock based compensation expense
