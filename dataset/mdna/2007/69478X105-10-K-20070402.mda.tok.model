item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary our principal business is attracting deposits from small businesses and consumers and investing those deposits together with funds generated from operations and borrowings  primarily in commercial business loans and various types of commercial real estate loans 
in  the bank expects to fund substantially all of the loans that it originates or purchases through deposits  fhlb advances and internally generated funds 
deposit flows and cost of funds are influenced by prevailing market rates of interest primarily on competing investments  account maturities and the levels of savings in the bank s market area 
the bank s ability to originate and purchase loans is influenced by the general level of product available 
the bank s results of operations are also affected by the bank s provision for loan losses and the level of operating expenses 
the bank s operating expenses primarily consist of employee compensation and benefits  premises and occupancy expenses  and other general expenses 
the company s results of operations are also affected by prevailing economic conditions  competition  government policies and other actions of regulatory agencies 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers these to be critical accounting policies 
the estimates and assumptions management uses are based on historical experience and other factors  which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions  which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at balance sheet dates and the company s results of operations for future reporting periods 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses and the valuation allowance on deferred taxes are the critical accounting policies that require estimates and assumptions in the preparation of the company s financial statements that are most susceptible to significant change

average balance sheet 
the following tables set forth certain information relating to the company for the years ended december    and the yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown 
average balances are measured on a daily basis

net interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
rate volume analysis 
the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume  and iii the net change 
the changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate

interest income interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  is primarily due to interest income on loans receivable increasing million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income on loans was primarily the result of an increase in the average loan balance of million from million in to million in combined with a basis points increase in the average yield on said loans from for to for the increase in loan yield is primarily due to the re pricing of our short term adjustable rate income property loans and the origination of higher yielding loans during interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase  or  primarily reflects an increase in the average balance of deposits and fhlb advances and other borrowings of million and million  respectively  during the year  combined with a basis points increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities that was due to a higher interest rate environment 
net interest income our primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income and net interest margin are affected by several factors including the level of  and the relationship between  the dollar amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the relationship between repricing or maturity of our variable rate and fixed rate loans and securities  and our deposits and borrowings  and the magnitude of our non interest earning assets  including non accrual loans and foreclosed real estate 
net interest income before provision for loan losses was million for each of the years ended december  and provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in the current year provision for loan losses was primarily due to the overall shift in our loan portfolio mix toward more commercial real estate  business and sba loans  which was partially offset by a decrease in our nonperforming loans by from million in to  in  net charge offs increased  in from a net recoveries of  in to  in net charge off in total net loans receivable in increased million  or  over noninterest income noninterest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase  or  was primarily due to an increase in gains from loan sales of million in compared to partially offsetting the increase from the gains on loan sales was a decrease in other income from the sale and collection of charged off loans related to the participation contract 
during and  the company collected  and million  respectively  in recoveries on the collection of charged off loans associated with the participation contract 
noninterest expense noninterest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase  or  in noninterest expense was principally due to increases in compensation and benefits of million and premises and occupancy of  these increases are reflective of the bank s investments in its strategic expansion through de novo branching and the addition of experienced business bankers to staff its new locations 
the number of employees at the bank grew from at december  to at december  a large portion of the increases in compensation and benefits   and premises and occupancy expense   for the year ended december  compared to the prior year  is associated with the bank s depository branches in the cities of costa mesa and los alamitos that opened in and newport beach scheduled to open in the first quarter of  and the sba loan production office in pasadena  which opened in january income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased to  for the year ended december  compared to a provision of million for the year ended december  the company had income before income taxes of million for the year ended december  compared to income before income taxes of million for the year ended december  in  the company eliminated its remaining valuation allowance for deferred taxes which reduced its provision by million 
in  the company reduced its valuation allowance for deferred taxes by million 
the elimination of the deferred tax valuation allowance is due to management s forecast of taxable earnings  based on assumptions regarding the company s growth in the near future 
comparison of operating results for the year ended december  and december  general for the year ended december   the company reported net income of million or per diluted share  compared with net income of million or per diluted share for the same period in the  increase in net income was primarily the result of increases in net interest income of million which was partially offset by increases in noninterest expense and provision for income tax of million and  respectively 
interest income interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  is primarily due to an increase of million in the average balance of our loans receivable  which was partially offset by no interest income from the participation contract in compared to million in the three residuals that made up the participation contract were either sold or terminated during interest income on loans receivable increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income on loans was primarily the result of an increase in the average loan balance from million in to million in combined with a basis points increase in the average yield on loans 
the increase in loan yield is primarily due to the re pricing of our short term adjustable rate income property loans 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase  or  primarily reflects an increase in the average balance of deposits and fhlb advances and other borrowings of million and million  respectively  during the year  combined with an basis points increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities that was due to a higher interest rate environment 
net interest income net interest income before provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase  or  in net interest income before provision for loan losses is primarily due to the million increase in the company s interest income which is predominately attributable to a increase in average loans outstanding of million  over the prior year period  which was partially offset by a decline in net interest margin of

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the current year provision for loan losses was primarily due to the growth in our loan portfolio 
nonperforming loans decreased by from million in to million in  with a corresponding decrease in net charge offs from  in to recoveries of  in total loans receivable in increased million  or  over noninterest income noninterest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the  decrease  or  was primarily due to a reduction of income associated with the participation contract of million partially offset by an increase in prepayment penalties of  and gains on loan sales of  in  the participation contract generated million gain from the sale or termination of the three residual interest components and  from recoveries on the collection of charged off loans associated with the participation contract 
during  the company collected million in recoveries on the collection of charged off loans associated with the participation contract 
noninterest expense noninterest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase  or  in noninterest expense was principally due to increases in compensation and benefits of  and premises and occupancy of  the increase in compensation and benefits was primarily due to an increase in the number of employees from full time employees at december  to full time employees at december  income taxes the provision for income taxes increased to a tax provision of million for the year ended december  compared to a provision of  for the year ended december  the company had income before income taxes of million for the year ended december  compared to income before income taxes of million for the year ended december  the company increased the deferred tax asset by reducing its deferred tax valuation allowance by million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in the deferred tax valuation allowance is due to management s forecast of taxable earnings  based on assumptions regarding the company s growth in the near future 
as the company achieves continuous taxable income and if the earning projections show that the company will have the ability to use its net operating loss carry forwards  then all or part of the remaining valuation allowance for deferred taxes of million will be eliminated 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  total assets of the company were million as of december   compared to million as of december  the million  or  increase in total assets is primarily due to the purchase of million of bank owned life insurance boli at the end of march  and an increase in securities available for sale of million  partially offset by a decrease in federal funds sold of million 
total liabilities of the company were million at december  compared to million at december  the million increase  or  was primarily due to increases of million in other borrowings and million in deposits 
total deposits at december  were million compared to million at december  in addition  fhlb advances and other borrowings increased by million and million  respectively  as of december  compared to the prior year end 
at december  and  our stockholders equity amounted to million and million  respectively 
the increase in stockholders equity was due primarily to million of net income for the year ended december  liquidity our primary sources of funds are principal and interest payments on loans  deposits and fhlb advances 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we seek to maintain a level of liquid assets to ensure a safe and sound operation 
our average liquidity ratios were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the liquidity ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of cash balances plus unpledged securities by the sum of deposits that mature in one year or less plus transaction accounts and fhlb advances 
our liquidity is monitored daily 
we believe the level of liquid assets is sufficient to meet current and anticipated funding needs 
liquid assets of the bank which are comprised of cash and unpledged investments represent approximately of total assets at december   of total assets at december  and of total assets at december  at december   the bank had four unsecured lines of credit with other correspondent banks totaling million to purchase federal funds as business needs dictate 
the bank had million on these lines at year end 
also  in march  the bank established a million credit facility which is secured by investments pledged to salomon brothers 
we also have a line of credit with fhlb allowing us to borrow up to of the bank s total assets as of september  or million  million of which was outstanding as of such date 
the fhlb advance line is collateralized by eligible loan collateral 
at december   we had approximately million of loans pledged to secure fhlb borrowings 
we had commitments for capital expenditures of  at december  related to the construction of our branch located in newport beach  california  that opened in the first quarter of at december   we had  in outstanding commitments to originate or purchase loans compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the bank s loan to deposit and borrowing ratio was  and as of december   and  respectively 
certificates of deposit  which are scheduled to mature in one year or less from december   totaled million 
we expect to retain a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit at maturity 
capital resources the bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the bank s assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
at december  and  the bank s leverage capital amounted to million and million  respectively  and its risk based capital amounted to million and million  respectively 
as a result  the bank exceeded the capital levels required to be considered well capitalized at that date 
pursuant to regulatory guidelines under prompt corrective action rules  a bank must have total risk based capital of or greater  tier risk based capital of or greater and a leverage ratio of or greater to be considered well capitalized 
at december   the bank s total risk based capital  tier risk based capital and leverage ratios were   and  respectively 
contractual obligations and commitments the company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business as a source of funds for its asset growth and to meet required capital needs 
the following schedule summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payment due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands contractual obligations fhlb borrowings other borrowings certificates of deposit operating leases total contractual cash obligations the following table summarizes our contractual commitments with off balance sheet risk as of december  in thousands other unused commitments loans to originate home equity lines of credit commercial lines of credit commercial letters of credit standby letters of credit impact of inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this annual report on form k have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts except with respect to securities classified as available for sale which are carried at market value without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same magnitude as the price of goods and services 
impact of new accounting standards in december  the fasb sfas no 
r which is a revision to sfas no 
 and which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
this statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using accounting principles board opinion apb no 
apb no 
 and generally requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
the statement does not change the accounting in sfas no 
 for transactions in which an enterprise exchanges its equity instruments for services of parties other than employees or the accounting for employee stock ownership plans  which are subject to sop the phase in period for this statement  as amended april  by the sec  began in the first quarter of based on the sec s phase in period  we adopted sfas no 
r on january  and account for share based compensation based on this new pronouncement 
we compute compensation expense for stock options using the black scholes valuation model and utilize the modified prospective method under sfas no 
r 
in march  the sec issued sab no 
 which provided interpretative guidance on sfas no 
r valuation method assumptions used in valuation models and the interaction of sfas no 
r with existing guidance 
in may  fasb issued sfas no 
sfas no 
provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes  unless impracticable  retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas no 
 effective january   did not have a material impact on our financial condition or operating results 
in february  fasb issued sfas no 
 an amendment of sfas no 
and sfas no 
the provisions of this statement allow financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis  and establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation 
the new statement also amends sfas no 
to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument 
the provisions of this standard are effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial condition or operating results 
in march  fasb issued sfas no 
the provisions of this statement require mortgage servicing rights to be initially valued at fair value 
sfas no 
also allows servicers to choose one of the following measurement methods subsequent to the initial fair value measurement the fair value measurement method  which measures servicing rights at fair value at each reporting date  with changes in fair value reported in earnings or the amortization method  which allows continued amortization of servicing rights over the period of estimated net servicing income or loss  consistent with the existing requirements of sfas no 
the provisions of this standard are effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year we currently use the amortization method to account for our servicing rights  and we expect to continue this practice after implementing sfas no 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial condition or operating results 
in june  the fasb issued fin no 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in an entity s financial statements  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position must meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin no 
also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
we do not expect fin no 
 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   to have a material impact on our financial condition or operating results 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 a standard that provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
the standard applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
under the standard  fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
the standard clarifies that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
in support of this principle  the standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data  for example  the reporting entity s own data 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
it is required that we adopt sfas no 
on january   however management is evaluating the financial impact and may choose to adopt sfas no 
effective january  in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which will require employers to fully recognize the obligations associated with single employer defined benefit pension  retiree healthcare and other postretirement plans in their financial statements 
the standard will make it easier for investors  employees  retirees and others to understand and assess an employer s financial position and its ability to fulfill the obligations under its benefit plans 
specifically  sfas no 
requires an employer to a recognize in its balance sheet an asset for a plan s overfunded status or a liability for a plan s underfunded status  b measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year with limited exceptions  and c recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur 
those changes will be reported in comprehensive income of a business entity 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial condition or operating results 
the requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure requirements are effective as of december  in september  the sec staff issued sab no 
 which expresses the sec staff s views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements 
sab no 
was issued primarily to address diversity in the practice of quantifying financial statement misstatements and the potential under current practice to build up improper amounts on the balance sheet 
this new guidance applies when uncorrected misstatements affect the current year 
to eliminate diversity in practice  sab no 
requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both the rollover and iron curtain methods  and then determine if either method results in a material error  as quantified in the existing guidance of staff accounting bulletin no 
materiality 
sab no 
is effective for errors identified during the year ended december  the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material impact on our financial condition or operating results 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
this statement requires companies to display on the face of the balance sheet the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which they have chosen to use fair value 
this standard also requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to easily understand the effect on earnings of a company s choice to use fair value 
sfas no 
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
this statement is effective as of our fiscal year beginning january  it is required that we adopt sfas no 
on january   however management is evaluating the financial impact and may choose to adopt sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk interest rate risk management 
the principal objective of the company s interest rate risk management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of appropriate risk given the company s business focus  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives and manage the risk consistent with board approved guidelines through the establishment of prudent asset and liability concentration guidelines 
through such activities  management seeks to reduce the vulnerability of the company s operations to changes in interest rates 
management monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operational strategies 
the bank s board of directors reviews on a quarterly basis the bank s asset liability position  including simulations of the effect on the bank s capital in various interest rate scenarios 
the extent of the movement of interest rates  higher or lower  is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of the company 
net portfolio value 
the bank s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a model that estimates the change in net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
a npv ratio  in any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the sensitivity measure is the decline in the npv ratio  in basis points  caused by a increase or decrease in rates  whichever produces a larger decline the sensitivity measure 
the higher an institution s sensitivity measure is  the greater its exposure to interest rate risk is considered to be 
the bank utilizes a market value model prepared by the ots the ots npv model  which is prepared quarterly  based on the bank s quarterly thrift financial reports filed with the ots 
the ots npv model measures the bank s interest rate risk by estimating the bank s npv  which is the net present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and any off balance sheet contracts  under various market interest rate scenarios  which range from a basis point increase to a basis point decrease in market interest rates 
as of december  and  the bank s sensitivity measure  as measured by the ots  was and basis points  respectively  as a result of a hypothetical basis point instantaneous increase in interest rates 
this would correspondingly result in a  increase for and a  increase for  respectively  in the npv of the bank 
interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value npv the following table show the npv and projected change in the npv of the bank at december   assuming an instantaneous and sustained change in market interest rates of   and basis points bp as of december  dollars in thousands npv as of portfolio net portfolio value value of assets change in rates amount change change npv ratio change bp bp bp bp bp bp bp static bp bp bp bp bp the model was not able to calculate meaningful results due to the low interest rate environment 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv requires the making of certain assumptions that may tend to oversimplify the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
first  the models assume that the composition of the bank s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured 
second  the models assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
third  the model does not take into account the impact of the bank s business or strategic plans on the structure of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
although the npv measurement provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to  does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income  and will differ from actual results 
selected assets and liabilities which are interest rate sensitive 
the following table provides information regarding the bank s primary categories of assets and liabilities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates for the year ended december  the information presented reflects the expected cash flows of the primary categories by year including the related weighted average interest rate 
the cash flows for loans are based on maturity and re pricing date 
the loans and mortgage backed securities that have adjustable rate features are presented in accordance with their next interest repricing date 
cash flow information on interest bearing liabilities  such as passbooks  now accounts and money market accounts also is adjusted for expected decay rates  which are based on historical information 
in addition  for purposes of cash flow presentation  premiums or discounts on purchased assets  and mark to market adjustments are excluded from the amounts presented
