item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview tractor supply company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the united states and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and of those who enjoy the rural lifestyle  as well as tradesmen and small businesses 
our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities and offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise o equine  pet and animal products  including items necessary for their health  care  growth and containment o maintenance products for agricultural and rural use o hardware and tool products o seasonal products  including lawn and garden power equipment o truck  trailer and towing products  and o work recreational clothing and footwear for the entire family 
our stores currently range in size from approximately  to  square feet of inside selling space and also utilize outside selling space 
we are developing stores using one of five standard prototypes as well as existing building structures 
our stores typically range in size from  square feet to  square feet of inside selling space and additional outside selling space 
our wholly owned subsidiary  del s farm supply  llc del s  operates stores  primarily in the pacific northwest  that offer a wide selection of products primarily in the equine  pet and animal category tailored to those who enjoy the rural lifestyle 
del s stores currently range in size from approximately  to  square feet of inside selling space with additional outside selling space 
our current and long term growth strategy is to expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores  enhance financial performance through same store sales increases  achieved through aggressive merchandising and marketing programs with an everyday low prices philosophy and supported by strong customer service  enhance product margin through selective assortment  vendor price negotiation  sourcing and optimization of transportation costs  leverage operating costs  especially occupancy  advertising and distribution  and expand through selective acquisition  as such opportunities arise  to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complimentary strategy to organic growth 
we have experienced considerable sales growth over the last five years  with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 
we plan to continue this growth strategy with an annual projected increase in our unit count of approximately 
this growth has expanded our market presence into states and one canadian province 
we believe the projected unit count increase  along with strategic relocations of stores into areas of greater retail opportunity  will contribute substantially to our future growth 
the acquisition of del s enabled us to establish an initial presence in the pacific northwest  primarily in washington  with one store in british columbia  canada 
we operated retail farm and ranch stores as of december  and have plans to open to stores in fiscal  and approximately store relocations 
we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over potential additional markets for new tractor supply stores excluding del s in the united states 
in addition  we continue to identify opportunities to relocate existing stores 
we plan to relocate additional stores over the next several years 
our store relocations are typically undertaken to move small  older stores to full size formats in improved retail areas 
we have relocated stores since we have placed significant emphasis on our merchandising programs  evaluating the sales and profitability of our products through detailed line reviews  review of vendor performance measures and modification of the overall product offerings 
these efforts  coupled with a strong marketing program and in depth product knowledge training of our store employees  have enhanced our sales and financial performance 
seasonality and weather our business is highly seasonal 
historically  our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of each year due to the sale of seasonal products 
unseasonable weather  excessive rain  drought  and early or late frosts may also affect our sales 
we believe  however  that the impact of adverse weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores 
we experience our highest inventory and accounts payable levels during our first fiscal quarter each year for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the winter selling season 
inflation although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation on our operations  we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by inflation 
we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services  which include  among other items  steel  grain  petroleum  corn  soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services 
moreover  in the last few years  energy prices have risen dramatically  which has resulted in increased fuel costs for our business and utility costs for our stores 
we have been successful in reducing or mitigating the effects of inflation  principally through selective buying from the most competitive vendors and by increasing retail prices 
however  there is no assurance that we will be successful in reducing or mitigating the effect of inflation in the future 
significant accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our financial position and or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 
revenue recognition and sales returns we recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services 
if we receive payment before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise as per our layaway program  the revenue is deferred until the sale is complete 
revenues from the sale of gift cards are deferred and recognized upon redemption 
we estimate a liability for sales returns based on a one year rolling average of historical return trends and we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns associated with past sales 
our estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year  however  as with any estimates  refunds activity may vary from estimated amounts 
inventory valuation impairment risk we identify potentially excess and slow moving inventory by evaluating turn rates  sales trends  age of merchandise  overall inventory levels and other benchmarks 
the estimated inventory valuation reserve to recognize any impairment in value ie  an inability to realize the full carrying value is based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies 
we do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term 
however  changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves 
shrinkage our stores perform physical inventories once a year and we have established reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts 
this is done by assessing the chain wide average shrinkage experience rate  applied to the related periods sales volumes 
such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences 
vendor support we receive funding from our vendors for the promotion of our brand as well as the sale of their products 
vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold  which is in compliance with emerging issues task force no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf 
the amount of expected funding is estimated based upon initial guaranteed commitments  as well as anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors 
the estimated purchase volume and related vendor funding is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels  sales trends and expected customer demand  as well as planned new store openings and relocations 
although we believe we have the ability to reasonably estimate purchase volume and related vendor funding  it is possible that actual results could significantly differ from the estimated amounts 
freight we incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases 
such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories on an aggregate basis and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold 
share based payments we have share based compensation plans covering certain members of management and non employee directors 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
accordingly  no compensation expense was recognized for fixed option plans because the exercise prices of employee stock options equaled or exceeded the market prices of the underlying stock on the dates of grant 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payments using the modified prospective transition method 
among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
as we adopted sfas r under the modified prospective transition method  results from prior periods have not been restated 
however  prior to adoption of sfas r  share based compensation had been included in pro forma disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to fiscal we estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant utilizing a modified black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
however  key assumptions used in the black scholes model are adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of our stock option awards 
option valuation models require the input of somewhat subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and expected life 
we rely on historical volatility trends to estimate future volatility assumptions 
other assumptions required for estimating fair value with the black scholes model are the expected risk free interest rate and expected life of the option 
the risk free interest rates used were actual us treasury zero coupon rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant 
the expected life of the option on the date of grant was estimated based on our historical experience for similar options 
in addition to the key assumptions used in the black scholes model  the estimated forfeiture rate at the time of valuation which is based on historical experience for similar options is a critical assumption  as it reduces expense ratably over the vesting period 
we adjust this estimate annually  based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from the previous estimate 
we believe our estimates are reasonable in the context of actual historical experience 
the impact of adopting sfas r on future results will depend on  among other matters  levels of share based payments granted in the future  actual forfeiture rates and the timing of option exercises 
sales tax reserve a portion of our sales are to tax exempt customers 
we obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each tax exempt transaction 
many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws 
the business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex environment of compliance 
these circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance 
while we believe we reasonably enforce sales tax compliance with our customers and endeavor to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations  there can be no assurance that we  upon final completion of such audits  would not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions 
we review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to determine if we have potential exposure for non compliance 
any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and our to date experience with each audit 
as each audit progresses  we quantify the exposure based on preliminary assessments made by the state auditors  adjusted for additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment 
the reserve for these tax audits can fluctuate depending on numerous factors  including the complexity of agricultural based exemptions  ambiguity in state tax regulations  the number of ongoing audits and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities 
insurance reserves we self insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance  workers compensation and general liability insurance plans 
we have stop loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values  for employee health insurance claims   for workers compensation and  for general liability 
the full extent of certain claims  especially workers compensation and general liability claims  may not become fully determined for several years 
therefore  we estimate potential obligations for liabilities that have been incurred but not yet reported based upon historical data  experience  and use of outside actuarial consultants 
although we believe the reserves established for these obligations are reasonably estimated  any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under these plans could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 
net sales cost of merchandise sold gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization income from operations interest expense  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased to  million in fiscal from  million in fiscal fiscal included an additional week of sales which impacted the current year sales increase by 
this increase resulted from the opening of new stores as well as a same store sales improvement of 
our average transaction value increased to and same store transaction value increased for fiscal average daily transaction count per store decreased to  while same store transaction count increased 
same store sales improvements of compared to in the prior year were strongest in the clothing footwear and equine pet animal categories  but were partially offset by lower than expected performance in seasonal power equipment  generators and cold weather related products  including insulated outerwear  snow removal and heating 
in fiscal  we opened new stores compared to new stores and the acquisition of del s stores in fiscal  relocated stores compared to in fiscal and closed one store compared to one closure in fiscal 
as a percent of sales  gross margin increased basis points to for fiscal from for fiscal gross margin was primarily impacted by a more favorable product mix  increased importing and improved inventory shrinkage 
during the year  we refined our method of estimating the freight cost component of inventory based on changes in our business and operating environment which included a change in mix of goods  an increased level of importing and rapidly increasing fuel costs 
this refinement provides a more appropriate matching of freight cost incurred with inventory and cost of merchandise sold 
this change in estimate increased the inventory value and reduced the freight component of cost of merchandise sold by approximately million for fiscal as a percent of sales  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to increased occupancy costs and a charge of million or of sales related to stock compensation expense 
during the year  we refined our method of estimating the amount of gift cards sold that will ultimately go unredeemed 
our estimate was based on an analysis of gift card sale and redemption patterns across an extended historical timeline 
we accordingly recognized a benefit of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
of the million recognized in fiscal  million or of sales was due to a modification of the redemption assumptions based on an analysis of historical redemption patterns 
this benefit has been included as a reduction in selling  general  and administrative expenses and is reflected as a reduction of other accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r share based payment sfas r using the modified prospective method and began recognizing compensation expense for share based payments based on the fair value of the awards 
share based payments include stock option grants and certain transactions under our other stock plans 
sfas r requires share based compensation expense recognized since the beginning of fiscal to be based on the following a grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas for unvested options granted prior to the adoption date  b grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r for all share based payments granted subsequent to the adoption date  and c the discount on shares sold to employees post adoption  which represents the difference between the grant date fair value and the employee purchase price 
for fiscal  the adoption of the sfas r fair value method resulted in additional compensation expense a component of selling  general and administrative expenses related to our stock plans that we would not have recognized had we continued to account for share based compensation under apb for fiscal  this share based compensation expense lowered pre tax income by million and net income by million 
depreciation and amortization expense increased in fiscal over fiscal due mainly to costs associated with new and relocated stores and remodeled existing stores 
net interest expense increased in fiscal from fiscal this increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates in fiscal and interest incurred as the result of federal and sales tax audits  partially offset by a reduction in average long term borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to in fiscal  resulting primarily from a higher effective income tax rate due to the non deductibility of certain stock compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas r 
as a result of the foregoing factors  net income for fiscal increased to million  or per diluted share  which includes a million charge  or per diluted share  in stock compensation expense 
this compares to net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased to  million in fiscal from  million in fiscal this increase resulted from the opening of new stores including additional stores from the acquisition of del s as well as a same store sales improvement of 
fiscal included an additional week compared to fiscal  which accounted for approximately of the sales increase 
our average transaction value increased to and same store average transaction value increased for fiscal average daily transactions per store decreased to  while same store transaction count increased 
the same store sales increase includes an approximate gain for fiscal which is attributed to increases in selling prices resulting from rising steel and petroleum related product costs 
same store transaction count increases were generally experienced across all product lines  with seasonal products representing the strongest category 
in fiscal  we opened new stores compared to in fiscal  acquired an additional del s stores  relocated stores compared to in fiscal and closed one store compared to one in fiscal 
as a percent of sales  gross margin increased basis points to for fiscal from for fiscal gross margin was primarily impacted by overall lower product costs partially offset by higher than anticipated transportation costs caused primarily by increased diesel fuel costs and overall capacity demands on the transportation industry 
as a percent of sales  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were comparable at and for fiscal and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization expense increased in fiscal over fiscal year due mainly to costs associated with new and relocated stores  remodeled existing stores and new distribution facilities 
net interest expense increased in fiscal from fiscal this increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates in fiscal partially offset by a reduction in average long term borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to in fiscal  resulting primarily from a higher effective state income tax rate due to the mix of business by state 
as a result of the foregoing factors  net income for fiscal increased to million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources in addition to normal operating expenses  our primary ongoing cash requirements are for expansion  remodeling and relocation programs  including inventory purchases and capital expenditures 
our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are funds provided from operations  commitments available under our revolving credit agreement  capital and operating leases and normal trade credit 
our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and winter selling seasons  respectively 
working capital at december   we had working capital of million  a million increase from december  this increase was primarily attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities in millions caption variance 
del current assets cash and cash equivalents inventories prepaid expenses and other current assets other  net current liabilities accounts payable accrued expenses income taxes payable other  net working capital del 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to increased cash generated from results of operations in fiscal the increase in inventories and related increase in accounts payable resulted primarily from the purchase of inventory for new stores  new merchandising initiatives and the addition of inventory due to a new larger distribution center in waverly  nebraska 
we also experienced increased inventory levels in many stores as the result of softer than anticipated sales for the fourth quarter  and planned improvements in our overall in stock position at the store level 
we experienced a basis point decrease in inventory turns approximately times per year  which contributed to a decrease in our financed inventory from approximately to 
the calculated financed inventory assumes average inventory  excludes in transit inventories and includes unopened stores 
trade credit arises from our vendors granting extended payment terms for inventory purchases 
payment terms generally vary from days to days depending on the inventory product 
the increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to increases in the scale of our business volume  the timing of the accruals and the related payment of those accruals 
the increase in income taxes payable resulted from increased income and the timing of estimated tax payments 
borrowings and credit facilities in august  we entered into a credit agreement with bank of america  na  as agent for a lender group the credit agreement  allowing us to borrow up to million 
the credit agreement was subsequently amended on january  and september  and replaced on february  see below 
both amendments included changes to certain financial covenants  primarily to provide flexibility for capital expenditures  and extended the maturity to february  there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement at december  and million was outstanding at december  the balance of funds available under the credit agreement may be utilized for borrowings and up to million for letters of credit  of which million and million were outstanding at december  and december   respectively 
these letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory 
the credit agreement bears interest at either the bank s base rate at december  or the london inter bank offer rate libor at december  plus an additional amount ranging from to per annum  adjusted quarterly based on our performance at december  
we are also required to pay  quarterly in arrears  a commitment fee ranging from to per annum at december  and adjusted quarterly based on our performance  on the average daily unused portion of the credit line 
there are no compensating balance requirements associated with the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains certain restrictions regarding additional indebtedness  capital expenditures  business operations  guarantees  investments  mergers  consolidations and sales of assets  transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates  and liens 
in addition  we must comply with certain quarterly restrictions based on a rolling four quarters basis regarding net worth  leverage ratio  fixed charge coverage  current ratio requirements and spending limits on capital expenditures 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  in february  we entered into a new senior credit facility with largely the same lender group as under the credit agreement 
the new senior credit facility provides for borrowings up to million with sublimits of million and million for letters of credit and swingline loans  respectively 
this agreement is unsecured and has a five year term  with proceeds expected to be used for working capital  capital expenditures and share repurchases 
borrowings will bear interest at either the bank s base rate or libor plus an additional amount ranging from to per annum  adjusted quarterly based on our performance at february  
we will also be required to pay a commitment fee ranging from to per annum for unused capacity 
this new agreement eliminates the capital expenditures  net worth and current ratio requirements from the previous credit agreement and requires quarterly compliance with respect to fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios 
sources and uses of cash our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations 
principal uses of cash for investing and financing activities are capital expenditures and payments on debt  respectively 
the following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years in millions caption

del 
the decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal compared with fiscal is primarily due to the net increase in inventory and accounts payable as discussed in the working capital section  partially offset by an increase in net income adjusted for non cash items

del net income depreciation and amortization deferred income taxes inventories and accounts payable prepaid expenses and other current assets accrued expenses other  net net cash provided by operations del 
the increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to the increase in net income exclusive of depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes  and a net decrease in inventory and accounts payable 
increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a relative decrease in accrued expenses was primarily due to the growth in cash provided by operations 
these increases were primarily due to the growth in our business during fiscal and the timing of payments 
investing activities investing activities used million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the majority of this cash requirement relates to our capital expenditures and  in fiscal  the acquisition of the assets of del s 
our significant store expansion  coupled with required investment in infrastructure  required the following capital expenditures  including capital leases in thousands caption 
del new and relocated stores and stores not yet opened    existing stores    distribution center capacity and improvements    information technology    corporate and other  del 
our long term growth strategy anticipates continued geographic market expansion and further concentration within existing markets 
this growth will also require continuing investment in information technology and people 
the costs reflected below are typically building improvements  as we lease the majority of our facilities 
we currently estimate that capital expenditures will approximate million in fiscal financing activities financing activities provided million  used million  and provided million in fiscal  and  respectively 
excluding the tax benefit recognized in as a result of the adoption of sfas r  financing activities in fiscal would have been million 
the cash provided by financing activities is largely net cash provided as a result of borrowings required by operations  partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of stock under stock incentive programs 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  borrowings available under the new senior credit facility  and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs  including store openings  relocations and renovations  over the next several years

the balances for these arrangements are discussed above 
we typically lease buildings for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these assets which allow us to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets 
letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory  primarily sourced overseas  and support certain risk management programs in a timely manner 
known trends  events  demands  commitments and uncertainties litigation we are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business 
after consultation with legal counsel  we expect these matters will be resolved without material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
any estimated loss related to such matters has been adequately provided in accrued liabilities to the extent probable and reasonably estimable 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in circumstances relating to these proceedings 
in july  a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the chancery court for davidson county  tennessee by the hawaii laborers pension plan against each of our directors  certain of our officers and one former director 
we were named as a nominal defendant 
on december   the court granted our motion to dismiss and ordered that all claims in the amended complaint be dismissed without prejudice 
although the plaintiff filed subsequent appellate motions  all were dismissed 
all applicable statutes of limitations have run  concluding the matter in our favor 
recent accounting pronouncements share based payments in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r is a revision of sfas and supersedes apb among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of the intrinsic value method of accounting and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard 
we adopted sfas r in fiscal  as required see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation  which allows companies to adopt a policy of presenting taxes in the income statement on either a gross or net basis 
taxes within the scope of this eitf would include taxes that are imposed on a revenue transaction between a seller and a customer  for example  sales taxes  use taxes  value added taxes  and some types of excise taxes 
eitf is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning in fiscal eitf will not impact the method for recording and reporting these sales taxes in our consolidated financial statements as our policy is to exclude all such taxes from revenue 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in june  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
tax positions that meet a more likely than not recognition threshold should be measured in order to determine the tax benefit to be recognized 
we will adopt fin in fiscal  as required 
we currently estimate a charge to retained earnings of approximately million to be recognized as the cumulative effect of adoption 
additionally  we anticipate the adoption of this pronouncement will increase our effective income tax rate in fiscal by approximately basis points 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from the credit agreement 
the credit agreement bears interest at either the bank s base rate and december  and december   respectively or libor and at december  and december   respectively plus an additional amount ranging from to per annum  adjusted quarterly  based on our performance at both december  and december  
we are also required to pay quarterly in arrears a commitment fee ranging from to based on the daily average unused portion of the credit line 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would result in approximately  of additional annual interest expense and would not impact the fair market value of the long term debt
