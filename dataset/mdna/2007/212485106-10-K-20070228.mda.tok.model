business outlook beginning in  we will provide only annual earnings guidance on a quarterly basis 
we believe the shift from quarterly to annual earnings guidance is in the best interests of our shareholders 
for  we expect record high revenues and diluted earnings per share performance 
we expect that earnings per diluted share will exceed 
while we expect some variability of results in the three business segments  overall  anticipated improvements in customer care and employee care will offset anticipated declines in information management 
this annual guidance encompasses a range of potential outcomes across our three businesses  balancing anticipated execution risks with significant opportunities for revenue growth and operating improvement 
execution risks include the continuing impact of the cingular and sprint migration  canadian currency exchange  increases in wages and benefits  and execution risks in each business 
potentially offsetting these challenges are the opportunities for further margin improvement and for revenue growth in all three businesses 
we will continue to pursue initiatives to drive further profitability improvement by rationalizing facilities  increasing productivity and managing our costs in in customer care  we expect continuation of the broad revenue growth trends experienced last year 
continued increases with existing and new clients will drive revenue growth approximately similar to our growth in customer care results in the second half of the year are typically stronger than results in the first half of the year  and we expect this seasonality in our clients customer demand to be true in as well 
in information management  we expect lower revenue  lower operating income and lower operating margins in  largely due to a decline in data processing revenue at cingular and sprint 
declines in revenue will be partially offset by further progress in the license and professional services business  with strong growth in international operations 
declines in operating income will be partially offset by tight cost control 
for employee care  our expectations include improvements in revenue and operating income 
we expect double digit revenue growth for the year  although it is likely to be somewhat less than the growth experienced in we continue to anticipate employee care reaching profitability in changes and delays to employee care hr outsourcing implementations are to be expected given their size  scope and complexity 
we are experiencing schedule delays and anticipate additional costs in the implementation of one of our large hr outsourcing contracts 
due to the size of the contract  these additional costs could have a significant impact on the operating income of employee care in and or over the life of the contract 
the potential impact of execution risk in employee care has been included as one of a range of potential outcomes taken into account in our guidance 
for the cellular partnership  we expect equity earnings to be about the same as earnings 
we expect our capital expenditures to be in the range of to of revenue for  as we plan to continue building contact center capacity to meet our customer care outsourcing demand 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources liquidity and cash flows cash flows from operating activities provided us with a significant source of funding for our investing and financing activities

free cash flows  defined as cash flows from operating activities excluding the impact of the accounts receivable securitization less capital expenditures net of proceeds related to disposal  were  and for  and  respectively 
we use free cash flow to assess the financial performance of the company 
we believe that free cash flow is useful to investors because it relates the operating cash flow of the company to the capital that is spent to continue and improve business operations  such as investment in the company s existing businesses 
further  free cash flow facilitates management s ability to strengthen the company s balance sheet  to repurchase the company s stock and to repay the company s debt obligations 
limitations associated with the use of free cash flow include that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it does not incorporate certain cash payments including payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions 
management compensates for these limitations by utilizing both the non gaap measure  free cash flow  and the gaap measure  cash from operating activities  in its evaluation of performance 
there are no material purposes for which we use this non gaap measure beyond the purposes described above

this includes our office complex in orlando  florida  which is leased from wachovia development corporation lessor  a wholly owned subsidiary of wachovia corporation  under an agreement that expires in june upon termination or expiration of the lease  we must either purchase the property from the lessor for  or arrange to have the office complex sold to a third party 
if the office complex is sold to a third party for an amount less than the  the amount paid by the lessor for the purchase of the complex from an unrelated third party  we have agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor up to if the office complex is sold to a third party for an amount in excess of  we are entitled to collect the excess 
at the inception of the lease  we recognized a liability of approximately for the related residual value guarantee 
the value of the guarantee was determined by computing the estimated present value of probability weighted cash flows that might be expended under the guarantee 
we have recorded a liability for the fair value of the obligation with a corresponding asset recorded as prepaid rent  which is being amortized to rental expense over the lease term 
the liability will remain on the balance sheet until the end of the lease term 
under the terms of the lease  we also provide certain indemnities to the lessor  including environmental indemnities 
due to the nature of such potential obligations  it is not possible to estimate the maximum amount of such exposure or the fair value 
we do not expect such amounts  if any  to be material

we believe that our present ability to borrow is greater than our established credit facilities in place 
if market conditions change and we experience a significant decline in revenues  our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced 
this could cause rating agencies to lower our credit ratings  thereby increasing our borrowing costs  or even causing a reduction in or elimination of our access to debt and ability to raise additional equity 
our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of a total of up to million of our common shares 
through december   we repurchased million shares of convergys stock for pursuant to these authorizations 
we may continue to execute share repurchases from time to time in order to take advantage of attractive share price levels  as determined by management 
the timing and terms of the transactions depend on a number of considerations including market conditions and our liquidity

market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our risk management strategy includes the use of derivative instruments to reduce the effects on our operating results and cash flows from fluctuations caused by volatility in currency exchange and interest rates 
in using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and interest rates  we expose ourselves to counterparty credit risk 
we manage exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with highly rated institutions that can be expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements and by diversifying the number of financial institutions with which we enter into such agreements 
interest rate risk at december   we had in outstanding variable rate borrowings 
the carrying amount of our borrowings reflects fair value due to their short term and variable interest rate features 
convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents we sometimes use interest rate swaps to hedge our interest rate exposure 
these instruments are hedges of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability 
these contracts are entered into to protect against the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from such transactions will be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
there were no outstanding interest rate swaps covering interest rate exposure at december  based upon our exposure to variable rate borrowings  a one percentage point change in the weighted average interest rate would change our annual interest expense by approximately foreign currency exchange rate risk our customer care segment serves a number of our us based clients using contact center capacity in canada  india and the philippines 
although the contracts with these clients are typically priced in us dollars  a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in canadian dollars cad  indian rupees inr or philippine pesos php  which represents a foreign exchange exposure 
in order to hedge the exposure related to the anticipated cash flow requirements denominated into these foreign currencies  we have entered into forward contracts with several financial institutions to acquire a total of cad  inr  and php  at a fixed price of  and  respectively  through september additionally  we have entered into option contracts to purchase approximately cad for a fixed price of through may the fair value of these derivative instruments as of december  is presented in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the potential loss in fair value at december  for such contracts resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in all foreign currency exchange rates is approximately this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures 
other foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars 
we periodically enter into forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges 
the purpose of these derivative instruments is to protect the company against foreign currency exposure pertaining to receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies different from the functional currencies of the company or the respective subsidiaries 
as of december   the fair value of these derivatives was foreign currency denominated revenue has been less than of our consolidated revenues during the last three years 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments in these areas based on historical experience and other relevant factors 
our estimates as of the date of the financial statements reflect our best judgment giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future  as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 
we have identified below the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most critical in compiling our statements of financial condition and operating results 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
goodwill at december   we had goodwill with a net carrying value of as disclosed in note of notes convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued to consolidated financial statements  we are required to test goodwill for impairment annually and at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 
the impairment test for goodwill involves a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the fair value  the second step requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss 
fair value of the reporting unit was determined using a combination of the market approach and the income approach 
under the market approach  fair value is based on actual stock price or transaction prices of comparable companies 
the market approach requires significant judgment regarding the selection of comparable companies 
under the income approach  value is dependent on the present value of net cash flows to be derived from the ownership 
the income approach requires significant judgment including estimates about future cash flows and discount rates 
as required  during the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual impairment tests for our reporting units information management international  information management north america  customer care and employee care 
based on the results of the first step  we had no goodwill impairment related to our four reporting units 
we believe we make every reasonable effort to ensure that we accurately estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
however  future changes in the assumptions used to make these estimates could result in the recording of an impairment loss 
deferred charges in connection with our information management data processing and employee care outsourcing arrangements  we often must perform a significant amount of set up activities or implementations  which include the installation and customization of our proprietary software in our centers 
under these arrangements  clients do not take possession of the software nor have the right to take possession of the software without incurring a significant penalty 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  the implementations are not treated as separate elements for revenue recognition purposes 
any proceeds collected for the implementations are deferred and recognized over the service period 
additionally  with respect to certain multiple element arrangements  we defer all revenue related to the contracts until the final element is delivered 
we capitalize all direct and incremental implementation and multiple element costs  to the extent recovery is probable  and amortize them ratably over the life of the arrangements as costs of providing service 
at inception and throughout the term of the contract  we evaluate recoverability by considering profits to be earned during the term of the contract  the creditworthiness of the client and  if applicable  contract termination penalties payable by the client in the event that the client terminates the contract early 
our estimate of profitability is dependent in large part on our estimate of costs 
although we make every reasonable effort to accurately estimate costs  revisions may be made based on actual costs incurred that could result in the recording of an impairment loss 
additionally  if the financial condition of a client were to deteriorate  resulting in a reduced ability to make payments  we may be unable to recover the costs  which would result in an impairment loss 
finally  our entitlement to termination fees may be subject to challenge if a client were to allege that we were in breach of contract 
however  based on our evaluation of the related contracts  we believe that the of deferred charges is recoverable

table of contents revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are discussed in detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
a portion of our revenues is derived from transactions that require a significant level of judgment 
this includes percentage of completion we recognize some software license and related professional and consulting revenues using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs at completion 
during  approximately of our consolidated revenues was recognized using the percentage of completion method 
this method of accounting relies on estimates of total expected contract revenues and costs 
this method is used because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
because the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of the contracts  recognized revenues are subject to revisions as the contracts progress to completion 
revisions in estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
accordingly  favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenue recognition  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in the reversal of previously recognized revenues 
when estimates indicate a loss under a contract  a provision for such loss is recorded as a component of costs of providing services 
as work progresses under a loss contract  revenues continue to be recognized  and a portion of the contract loss incurred in each period is charged to the contract loss reserve 
license arrangements approximately of our revenue was derived from license and support and maintenance arrangements 
the accounting for these arrangements can be complex and requires a significant amount of judgment 
some of the factors that we must assess include the separate elements of the arrangement  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the various undelivered elements of the arrangement  whether the software fees are fixed or determinable  whether the fees are considered collectible and whether services included in the arrangement represent significant production  customization or modification of the software 
multiple element outsourcing arrangements employee care  which accounted for of our consolidated revenues in  often delivers multiple services under our client arrangements eg  benefits administration  staffing  payroll and learning 
in connection with these arrangements  we must assess these multiple element arrangements to determine whether they can be separated into more than one unit of accounting 
emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  establishes the following criteria  all of which must be met  in order for a deliverable to qualify as a separate unit of accounting the delivered items have value to the client on a stand alone basis 
there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the company 
if these criteria are met  each of the contractual services included in the contract is treated as a separate unit of accounting 
if these criteria are not met  which has been the case for the majority of employee care contracts entered into to date  all of the services included are accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
revenue is then recognized either using a proportional performance method such as recognizing revenue based on transactional services delivered or on a straight line basis once employee care begins to deliver the final service 
the assessments of these areas require us to make a significant amount of judgments 
the judgments made in convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued these areas could have a significant effect on revenues recognized in any period by changing the amount and or the timing of the revenue recognized 
we believe that we make a reasonable effort to ensure accuracy in our judgment and estimates 
contingencies the company is from time to time subject to claims and administrative proceedings that are filed in the ordinary course of business 
the company believes that the results of any such claims or administrative proceedings  either individually or in the aggregate  will not have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial condition

each of the reseller cases seeks damages ranging from to plus treble damages under ohio law 
the consumer case seeks damages in excess of plus treble damages under ohio law 
all five of the reseller cases were dismissed 
however  during the fourth quarter of  two of these dismissals were reversed and reinstated by the ohio th district court of appeals 
cincinnati smsa limited partnership sought review of these two reversals in the ohio supreme court 
oral argument was held before the ohio supreme court on january  and the court has not yet rendered a decision in these matters 
four claims were also filed at the public utilities commission of ohio puco 
three of the four were filed by plaintiffs who had also initiated actions in court of common pleas  cuyahoga county  and that were either dismissed by the trial court or voluntarily dismissed 
the puco dismissed the complaints and the cases were appealed to the ohio supreme court 
the ohio supreme court affirmed the dismissals of these four cases 
a motion by cincinnati smsa limited partnership to dismiss the consumer case was granted  in part  and overruled  in part  by the trial court 
cincinnati smsa limited partnership sought review by the ohio supreme court of the part of the trial court s decision that overruled the motion to dismiss 
the ohio supreme court denied review of the consumer class action  and the consumer case will proceed into the discovery phase of litigation 
pursuant to the partnership agreement  convergys  as a limited partner  has no right to direct or participate in the defense of these actions and  therefore  has no current ability to assess the merit of any claims made in these actions or identify any possible loss  which could result from these claims against the partnership

the state of florida s attorney general s office exercised its right to intervene in this action 
the company has been served with the complaint  but has not yet been required to respond 
because the claim relates to the company s contract with dms  the attorney general has invoked the pre suit dispute resolution procedures set forth in such contract  which require various discussions and then mediation between the parties to determine whether the claims can be resolved without resorting to further litigation 
discussions are continuing 
while we have made progress in the discussions  this matter was not resolved at december   but the company does not believe this matter will have a materially adverse impact on the company s financial condition 
the company is currently attempting to resolve tax audits relating to prior years in various jurisdictions 
the company believes that it is appropriately reserved with regard to these audits as of december  however  to the extent that the ultimate resolutions vary from the amounts reserved  such impact would be recorded to the tax provision in the period in which such resolution is reached 
restructuring accrual during the last five years  we have recorded significant restructuring charges related to reductions in headcount and facility closures 
as of december   we had a restructuring accrual of  of which relates to facility closure costs  which will be paid over several years until the leases expire 
the accrual is equal to the future costs associated with those abandoned facilities  net of the proceeds from any probable future sublease agreements

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination as to convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence 
this evidence includes historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned 
the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences is based on current tax law and the company s tax methods of accounting 
the company also reviews its tax activities and records an accrual for estimated losses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining the company s provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there can be events or circumstances for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
the company establishes reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
the reserves are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the resolution of outstanding tax audits or contingencies in various jurisdictions 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions  changes to the reserves  as well as the related net interest

such consolidations may result in the termination of an existing client contract  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
in october  cingular completed its acquisition of at t wireless 
prior to the acquisition  at t wireless was our largest client in terms of revenue and a significant client of both information management and customer care 
with respect to information management  we are assisting cingular with its strategy to migrate subscribers off of the at t wireless billing systems which we support onto cingular s two systems one of which we support by the end of the first quarter of if the migration continues as planned  it will negatively impact information management s revenues and earnings 
however  as evidenced by a contract extension signed in december  we expect to continue to support one of cingular s systems 
our customer care segment also had a long standing relationship with at t wireless 
we expect cingular to remain an important client to customer care 
in september  sprint pcs  a large information management data processing outsourcing client  completed its acquisition of nextel communications 
the client informed us that it intended to consolidate its billing systems onto a competitor s system and they have announced plans to migrate subscribers from our billing system during and the migration began in we will support sprint nextel with their migration efforts 
if the migration proceeds as planned  it will negatively impact information management s revenues and operating results 
in december  at t inc and bell south corporation merged 
while the impact of this merger on the company is unknown  the company has long standing relationships with both at t and bell south 
prior to the merger  cingular a joint venture between at t inc and bell south corporation was our largest client in terms of revenue 
a large portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of clients  and the loss of one or more of our clients could cause a reduction in our revenues and earnings 
we rely on several clients for a large percentage of our revenues 
our three largest clients  at t  sprint nextel and directv  collectively represented of our revenues 
our relationship with at t is represented by separate contracts work orders with both information management and customer care 
our relationship with sprint nextel is represented by separate contracts with information management and customer care

as a result  we do not believe that it is likely that our entire relationship with at t  sprint nextel or directv would terminate at one time  and  therefore  we are not substantially dependent on any particular contract work order with these clients 
however  the loss of all of the contracts work orders within a particular client at the same time or the loss of one or more of the larger contracts work orders with a client would adversely affect our total revenues if the revenues from such client were not replaced with revenues from that client or other clients 
a large portion of our accounts receivable are payable by a limited number of clients and the inability of any of these clients to pay its accounts receivable could cause a reduction in our revenues and earnings 
several significant clients account for a large percentage of our accounts receivable 
as of december   our three largest clients  at t  sprint nextel and directv  collectively accounted for of our accounts receivable 
during the past three years  each of these clients has generally paid its accounts receivable on a timely basis  and write downs that we have incurred in connection with such accounts receivable were consistent with write downs that we incurred with other clients 
we anticipate that several clients will continue to account for a large percentage of our accounts receivable 
although we currently do not expect payment issues with any of these clients  if any of them were unable or unwilling  for any reason  to pay its accounts receivable  our income would decrease 
we also carry significant receivable balances with other clients whose declaration of bankruptcy could decrease our income 
if our clients are not successful  the amount of business that they outsource and the prices that they are willing to pay for such services may diminish and could result in a reduction of our revenues and earnings 
our revenues depend on the success of our clients 
if our clients are not successful  the amount of business that they outsource may be diminished 
thus  although we have signed contracts  many of which contain minimum revenue commitments  to provide services to our clients  there can be no assurance that the level of revenues generated by such contracts will meet expectations 
in addition  several clients  particularly in the communications and technology industries  have experienced substantial price competition 
as a result  we may continue to face increasing price pressure from such clients  which could negatively affect our operating performance 
we process  transmit and store personally identifiable information  and unauthorized access to or the unintended release of this information could result in a claim for damages  loss of business and create unfavorable publicity 
we process  transmit and store personally identifiable information  both in our role as a service provider and as an employer 
this information may include social security numbers  financial and health information  as well as other personal information 
as a result  we are subject to certain federal and state laws  as well as foreign laws and regulations designed to protect personally identifiable information 
we take measures to protect against unauthorized access and to comply with these laws and regulations 
unauthorized access or failure to comply with these laws and regulations may subject us to contractual liability and damages  loss of business  damages from individual claimants  fines  penalties  criminal prosecution and unfavorable publicity  any of which could negatively affect our operating results 
the global scope  size and complexity of implementations in our employee care business could cause delays and cost overruns in those projects  which could adversely affect revenues and profits 
we have won several long term  human resource outsourcing contracts with global clients 
these contracts are complex as they involve providing multiple services such as payroll  recruiting  benefits administration  learning  compensation and human resources administration across many countries 
implementations of the contracts can take more than months to complete 
due to the complexity of the implementations and changes in customer requirements ie  an acquisition by a customer during the implementation  implementation cost overruns and delays are possible 
cost overruns can result in additional expense during the implementation period and over the life of the contract  which would likely affect the profitability of the contract 
given the size of some of these contracts  the impact from these cost overruns or schedule delays can have a significant impact on our convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents revenues and profits 
delays in completing the implementations can cause us to recognize revenue and profit from the contracts later than we anticipated when the initial contract was signed 
our ability to deliver our services is at risk if the technology and network equipment that we rely upon is not maintained or upgraded in a timely manner 
technology is a critical foundation in our service delivery 
we utilize and deploy internally developed and third party software solutions across various hardware environments 
we operate an extensive internal communications network that links our global sites together in a multi hub model that enables the rerouting of data and voice traffic 
also  we rely on multiple public communication channels for connectivity to our clients 
maintenance of and investment in these foundational components are critical to our success 
if the reliability of technology or network operations fall below required service levels  or a systemic fault affects the organization broadly  business from our existing and potential clients may be jeopardized and cause our revenue to decrease 
emergency interruption of data centers and customer care and employee care contact centers could have a material  adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in the event that we experience a temporary or permanent interruption at one or more of our data or contact centers  through casualty  operating malfunction or other causes  we may be unable to provide the data processing  customer care and employee care services we are contractually obligated to deliver 
this could result in us being required to pay contractual damages to some clients or to allow some clients to terminate or renegotiate their contracts 
notwithstanding contingency plans and precautions instituted to protect our clients and us from events that could interrupt delivery of services including property and business interruption insurance that we maintain  there is no guarantee that such interruptions would not result in a prolonged interruption in our ability to provide support services to our clients or that such precautions would adequately compensate us for any losses we may incur as a result of such interruptions 
defects or errors within our software could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
design defects or software errors may delay software introductions or reduce the satisfaction level of clients and may have a materially adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our billing software is highly complex and may  from time to time  contain design defects or software errors that may be difficult to detect and or correct 
since both our clients and we use our billing software to perform critical business functions  design defects  software errors or other potential problems within or outside of our control may arise from the use of our software 
it may also result in financial or other damages to our clients  for which we may be held responsible 
although our license agreements with our clients may often contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential claims and liabilities arising from client problems  these provisions may not effectively protect us against such claims in all cases and in all jurisdictions 
claims and liabilities arising from client problems could result in monetary damages to us and could cause damage to our reputation  adversely affecting our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if the global trend toward outsourcing does not continue  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
revenue growth depends  in large part  on the trend toward outsourcing  particularly as it relates to our customer care and employee care outsourcing operations 
outsourcing involves companies contracting with a third party  such as convergys  to provide customer care and employee care services rather than performing such services in house 
there can be no assurance that this trend will continue  as organizations may elect to perform such services in house 
a significant change in this trend could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
a longer sales cycle could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
during the past few years  we have focused on transforming the employee care segment into a leading convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued provider in the growing human resource outsourcing market 
although we won long term global human resource outsourcing arrangements with several clients  the sales cycles for large global human resource outsourcing arrangements have ranged from to months 
the sales cycle is long due to complexities associated with outsourcing human resource functions  including decisions regarding what functions to outsource  locations and timing of outsourcing 
this longer sales cycle can result in delays in the execution of the contracts  increase selling costs and negatively impact our revenues and operating results 
if we are unable to identify and complete appropriate acquisitions  we may not be able to achieve historical growth rates 
our growth has been enhanced through acquisitions of other businesses including their service offerings and licenses 
we continue to pursue strategic acquisitions 
if we are unable to make appropriate acquisitions on reasonable terms  whether for cash  convergys securities or both  it may be difficult for us to achieve the same level of growth as achieved historically 
we are susceptible to business and political risks from domestic and international operations that could result in reduced revenues or earnings 
we operate businesses in many countries outside the united states  which are located throughout north and south america  europe  the middle east and the asian pacific region 
as part of our strategy  we plan to capture more of the international billing and employee care markets 
additionally  north american companies have created a demand for offshore customer care outsourcing capacity 
as a result  we expect to continue expansion through start up operations and acquisitions in foreign countries 
expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional countries will require management attention and financial resources 
in addition  there are certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally including exposure to currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles  greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in complying with a variety of foreign laws  changes in legal or regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  political instability  civil disturbances  terrorist attacks and potentially adverse tax consequences 
to the extent that we are adversely affected by these risks  our business could be adversely affected and our revenues and or earnings could be reduced 
in addition  there has been political discussion and debate related to worldwide competitive sourcing  particularly from the united states to offshore locations 
federal and state legislation has been proposed that relates to this issue 
future legislation in this area  if enacted  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
if the us dollar weakens  our earnings will continue to be negatively impacted 
customer care serves an increasing number of its us based customer care clients using contact center capacity in canada  india and the philippines 
although the contracts with these clients are typically priced in us dollars  a substantial portion of the costs incurred by customer care to render services under these contracts is denominated in canadian dollars  indian rupees or philippine pesos  which represents a foreign exchange exposure to the company 
we enter into forward exchange contracts and options to limit potential foreign currency exposure 
as the us dollar weakened during and  the operating expenses of these contact centers  once translated into us dollars  increased in comparison to prior years 
the increase in operating expenses was partially offset by gains realized through the settlement of the hedged instruments 
however  if the us dollar weakens  our earnings will continue to be negatively impacted 
if we do not effectively manage our capacity  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our ability to profit from the global trend toward outsourcing depends largely on how effectively we manage our customer care and employee care contact center capacity 
there are several factors and trends that have intensified the challenge of contact center management 
convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents items continued  a 
and in order to create the additional capacity necessary to accommodate new or expanded outsourcing projects  we must open new contact centers 
the opening or expansion of a contact center may result  at least in the short term  in idle capacity until we fully implement the new or expanded program 
we periodically assess the expected long term capacity utilization of our contact centers 
as a result  we may  if deemed necessary  consolidate  close or partially close under performing contact centers to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins 
there can be no guarantee that we will be able to achieve or maintain optimal utilization of our contact center capacity 
as part of our effort to consolidate our facilities  we seek to sublease a portion of our surplus space  if any  and recover certain costs associated with it 
to the extent that we fail to sublease such surplus space  our expenses will increase 
if we are unable to hire or retain qualified personnel in certain areas of our business  our ability to execute our business plans in those areas could be impaired and revenues could decrease 
we employ approximately  employees worldwide 
at times  we have experienced difficulties in hiring personnel with the desired levels of training or experience 
additionally  particularly in regard to the labor intensive business of customer care and employee care  quality service depends on our ability to control personnel turnover 
any increase in the employee turnover rate could increase recruiting and training costs and decrease operating effectiveness and productivity 
we may not be able to continue to hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel to adequately staff new client projects 
this is particularly critical in connection with the recent contracts signed by employee care 
because a significant portion of our operating costs relates to labor costs  an increase in wages  costs of employee benefits or employment taxes could have a materially adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
continued war and terrorist attacks or other civil disturbances could lead to economic weakness and could disrupt our operations resulting in a decrease of our revenues and earnings 
in march  the united states went to war against iraq and  in recent years  the united states  the united kingdom  india and spain were targets of terrorist attacks 
these attacks have caused uncertainty in the global financial markets and in the united states economy 
the war in iraq and any additional terrorist attacks may lead to continued armed hostilities or further acts of terrorism and civil disturbances in the united states or elsewhere  which may contribute to economic instability in the united states and disrupt our operations 
such disruptions could cause service interruptions or reduce the quality level of the services that we provide  resulting in a reduction of our revenues 
these activities may also cause our clients to delay or defer decisions regarding their use of our services and  thus  delay receipt of additional revenues 
in addition  war and terrorist attacks in other regions  including the middle east  could disrupt our operations and or create economic uncertainty with our clients  which could cause a reduction in revenues and earnings
