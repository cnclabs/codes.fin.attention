item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations  which should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following are factors that regularly affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  our business is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in item a of this annual report 
product costs and supply the level of profitability in the retail propane  fuel oil  natural gas and electricity businesses is largely dependent on the difference between retail sales price and product cost 
the unit cost of our products  particularly propane  fuel oil and natural gas  is subject to volatility as a result of product supply or other market conditions  including  but not limited to  economic and political factors impacting crude oil and natural gas supply or pricing 
we enter into product supply contracts that are generally one year agreements subject to annual renewal  and also purchase product on the open market 
we attempt to reduce price risk by pricing product on a short term basis 
our propane supply contracts typically provide for pricing based upon index formulas using the posted prices established at major supply points such as mont belvieu  texas  or conway  kansas plus transportation costs at the time of delivery 
in certain instances  and when market conditi ons are favorable as was the case in the fuel oil market during the first half of fiscal  we are able to purchase product under our supply arrangements at a discount to the market 
in addition  to supplement our annual purchase requirements  we may utilize forward fixed price purchase contracts to acquire a portion of the propane that we resell to our customers  which allows us to manage our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity prices and to assure adequate physical supply 
the percentage of contract purchases  and the amount of supply contracted for under forward contracts at fixed prices  will vary from year to year based on market conditions 
product cost changes can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact profitability 
there is no assurance that we will be able to pass on product cost increases fully or immediately  particularly when product costs increase rapidly 
therefore  average retail sales prices can vary significantly from year to year as product costs fluctuate with propane  fuel oil  crude oil and natural gas commodity market conditions 
in addition  in periods of sustained higher commodity prices  as has been experienced over the past several fiscal years  retail sales volumes may be negatively impacted by customer conservation efforts 
seasonality the retail propane and fuel oil distribution businesses  as well as the natural gas marketing business  are seasonal because of the primary use for heating in residential and commercial buildings 
historically  approximately two thirds of our retail propane volume is sold during the six month peak heating season from october through march 
the fuel oil business tends to experience greater seasonality given its more limited use for space heating and approximately three fourths of our fuel oil volumes are sold between october and march 
consequently  sales and operating profits are concentrated in our first and second fiscal quarters 
cash flows from operations  therefore  are greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for product purchased during the winter heating season 
we expect lower operating profits and either net losses or lower net income during the period from april through september our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
t o the extent necessary  we will reserve cash from the second and third quarters for distribution to holders of our common units in the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
weather weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for our products  in particular propane  fuel oil and natural gas  for both heating and agricultural purposes 
many of our customers rely heavily on propane  fuel oil or natural gas as a heating source 
accordingly  the volume sold is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in our service areas  which can vary substantially from year to year 
in any given area  sustained warmer than normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane  fuel oil and natural gas consumption  while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater use 
hedging and risk management activities we engage in hedging and risk management activities to reduce the effect of price volatility on our product costs and to ensure the availability of product during periods of short supply 
we enter into propane forward and option agreements with third parties  and use fuel oil futures and option contracts traded on the nymex  to purchase and sell propane and fuel oil at fixed prices in the future 
the majority of the futures  forward and option agreements are used to hedge forecasted purchases of propane or fuel oil and are generally settled at expiration of the contract 
although we use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of price volatility associated with forecasted transactions  we do not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes 
risk management activities are monitored by an internal commodity risk management committee  made up of five members of management  through enforcement of our hedging and risk management policy and reported to our audit committee 
as a result of various market factors during the first half of fiscal  particularly commodity price volatility during the first four months of the fiscal year  we experienced additional margin opportunities due to favorable pricing under certain supply arrangements and from our supply and risk management activities 
these market conditions generated additional operating profit of approximately million during the year ended september  however  supply and risk management transactions may not always result in increased product margins and there can be no assurance that these favorable market conditions will be present in the future in order to provide the additional margin opportunities realized during fiscal see item a of this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note  summary of significant accounting policies  included within the notes to consolidated financial statements section elsewhere in this annual report 
certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring management to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated results 
estimates are used when accounting for depreciation and amortization of long lived assets  employee benefit plans  self insurance and litigation reserves  environmental reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  asset val uation assessments and valuation of derivative instruments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known to us 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of supervisors 
we believe that the following are our critical accounting estimates revenue recognition 
sales of propane  fuel oil and refined fuels are recognized at the time product is delivered to the customer 
revenue from the sale of appliances and equipment is recognized at the time of sale or when installation is complete  as applicable 
revenue from repairs  maintenance and other service activities is recognized upon completion of the service 
revenue from hvac service contracts is recognized ratably over the service period 
revenue from the natural gas and electricity business is recognized based on customer usage as determined by meter readings  plus an amount for natural gas and electricity delivered but unbilled at the end of each accounting period 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate our allowances for doubtful accounts using a specific reserve for known or anticipated uncollectible accounts  as well as an estimated reserve for potential future uncollectible accounts taking into consideration our historical write offs 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
we estimate the rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate to estimate the present value of future benefit obligations and the cost of future health care benefits in determining our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in market conditions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and our future expense 
see liquidity and capital resources pension plan assets and obligations below for additional disclosure regarding pension benefits 
self insurance reserves 
our accrued insurance reserves represent the estimated costs of known and anticipated or unasserted claims under our general and product  workers compensation and automobile insurance policies 
accrued insurance provisions for unasserted claims arising from unreported incidents are based on an analysis of historical claims data 
for each claim  we record a self insurance provision up to the estimated amount of the probable claim utilizing actuarially determined loss development factors applied to actual claims data 
our self insurance provisions are susceptible to change to the extent that actual claims development differs from historical claims development 
we maintain insurance coverage wherein our net exposure for insured claims is limited to the insurance deductible  claims above which ar e paid by our insurance carriers 
for the portion of our estimated self insurance liability that exceeds our deductibles  we record an asset related to the amount of the liability expected to be paid by the insurance companies 
environmental reserves 
we establish reserves for environmental exposures when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based upon our evaluation of costs associated with environmental remediation and ongoing monitoring activities 
inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations due to unknown conditions and changing laws and regulations 
these liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 
accrued environmental reserves are exclusive of claims against third parties  and an asset is established where contribution or reimbursement from such third parties  such as governmental agencies  has been agreed and we are reasonably assured of receiving such contribution or rei mbursement 
environmental reserves are not discounted 
goodwill impairment assessment 
we assess the carrying value of goodwill at a reporting unit level  at least annually  based on an estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit 
fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses taking into consideration estimated cash flows in a ten year projection period and a terminal value calculation at the end of the projection period 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
see item a of this annual report for information about accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
executive overview of results of operations and financial condition during fiscal  we took several steps to deliver increasing value to our unitholders  streamline our cost structure and further strengthen our balance sheet 
through our efforts over the past two fiscal years to drive operating efficiencies  reduce costs and improve our customer mix  during fiscal we reported our second consecutive year of record earnings 
net income for fiscal of million  or per common unit  increased million compared to net income of million  or per common unit  in the prior year 
ebitda as defined and reconciled below increased million  or  to million in fiscal  compared to ebitda of million in fiscal fiscal included weeks of operations compared to weeks in fiscal from a cash flow perspective  despite the sustained period of high commodity prices  we continue to fund working capital requirements from cash on hand and have not borrowed under our working capital facility since april additionally  during fiscal we made a voluntary contribution of million to our pension plan from cash on hand in order to fully fund our accumulated benefit obligation which we believe will reduce  if not eliminate  future funding requirements 
even after this voluntary contribution  we ended fiscal in a strong cash position with approximately million in cash on hand  an increase of million  or  compared to the end of fiscal on the strength of these earnings and improved cash flows  our board of supervisors increased the annualized distribution rate by per common unit during fiscal to per common unit  an increase of compared to the annualized distribution rate at the end of fiscal subsequent to the end of fiscal  we also closed on the sale of our tirzah  south carolina underground propane storage facility and related mile pipeline the tirzah sale for net proceeds of million  thus further increasing the cash on hand 
the most significant factor contributing to the growth in earnings was a million  or  decline in combined operating and general and administrative expenses excluding certain items of a non recurring nature in both fiscal years as described below for fiscal compared to the prior year  despite a million increase in variable compensation costs in line with higher earnings 
since our field and hvac realignment process began at the end of fiscal  we have eliminated nearly  positions and retired nearly  vehicles from our fleet  generating significant savings in our fixed cost structure for the foreseeable future 
in addition  our efforts to improve our customer mix through the strategic exit from certain lower margin business in both the propane and refined fuels segments contributed to the improved year over year operating results 
specifically  in the propane segment  we focused on higher margin residential customers and  in several instances  exited certain lower margin commercial  industrial and agricultural customers which accounted for a decrease in volumes sold of approximately million gallons compared to the prior year 
in the fuel oil and refined fuels segment  our decision to exit certain lower margin diesel and gasoline business resulted in a decrease in volumes sold of approximately million gallons in fiscal compared to the prior year 
overall  retail propane volumes sold during fiscal decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons compared to million gallons in fiscal sales of fuel o il and refined fuels decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons in fiscal compared to million gallons in fiscal ongoing customer conservation in the sustained high energy price environment  combined with the impact of exiting lower margin business  has had the most significant negative impact on volumes  despite colder average temperatures compared to the prior year 
average temperatures in our service territories were of normal for fiscal compared to of normal temperatures in the prior year 
in the commodities market  average posted prices for both propane and fuel oil remained high relative to historical trends and  in particular  increased sharply towards the end of fiscal average posted prices for propane increased and average fuel oil prices decreased during fiscal compared to the prior year 
by the end of september the average posted prices for propane and fuel oil were and higher  respectively  compared to the average posted prices at the end of september the impact of lower volumes was offset to an extent by higher average margins from an improved customer mix  as well as from additional margin opportunities due to favorable pricing under certain supply arrangements and from hedging and risk management activities  particularly during the first half of fiscal we attribute approximately million of the fiscal profitability to the favorable supply and market factors 
however  supply and risk management activities may not always result in increased product margins and there can be no assurance that the favorable market conditions will be present in the future in order to provide the additional margin contribution realized in fiscal net income and ebitda for fiscal included i a non cash pension settlement charge of million to accelerate the recognition of actuarial losses in our defined benefit pension plan as a result of the level of lump sum retirement benefit payments made during fiscal  ii severance charges of million related to positions eliminated in fiscal  iii a million gain from the recovery of a substantial portion of legal fees associated with our successful defense of a matter following the acquisition of certain propane assets in north and south carolina  iv gains reported within discontinued operations of million from the sale and exchange of customer service centers considered to be non strategic  and v a non cash adjustment to the provision for income taxes deferred taxes of million 
ebitda and net income for fiscal were unfavorably impacted by million as a result of certain significant items relating mainly to i million of restructuring charges primarily related to severance benefits associated with our field realignment and the restructuring of our hvac business  ii incremental professional services fees of million associated with the gp exchange transaction consummated on october   iii a non cash pension settlement charge of million  and iv a million charge included within cost of products sold to reduce the carrying value of service inventory that will no longer be marketed by our customer service centers as a result of our reorganization 
as we look ahead to fiscal  our anticipated cash requirements include i maintenance and growth capital expenditures of approximately million  ii approximately million of interest and income tax payments  and  iii assuming distributions remain at the current level  approximately million of distributions to common unitholders 
based on our current estimate of our cash position  availability under the revolving credit agreement unused borrowing capacity under the working capital facility of million at september  and expected cash flow from operating activities  we expect to have sufficient funds to meet our current and future obligations 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year fiscal included weeks of operations compared to weeks in the prior year  which has affected operating results for all categories discussed below

total revenues decreased million  or  to  million for the year ended september  compared to  million for the year ended september   driven primarily by lower volumes in each of our operating segments  offset to an extent by the higher average selling prices 
as reported by noaa  average temperatures in our service territories were warmer than normal for fiscal compared to warmer than normal temperatures in fiscal lower volumes  despite the colder average temperatures compared to the prior year  were attributed to ongoing customer conservation driven by high energy costs  our ongoing efforts to improve our customer mix by exiting certain lower margin accounts  as well as the impact of the additional week of operations in the prior year 
revenues from the distribution of propane and related activities of  million for the year ended september  decreased million  or  compared to  million in the prior year  primarily due to lower volumes  offset to an extent by higher average selling prices 
retail propane gallons sold in fiscal decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons from million gallons in the prior year 
propane volumes sold were negatively affected by customer conservation efforts  and our effort to focus on higher margin residential customers 
average propane selling prices increased year over year as a result of higher commodity prices for propane and a more favorable customer mix 
the average posted price of propane during fiscal increased compared to the average posted prices in the prior year 
additionally  included within the propane segment are revenues from whol esale and risk management activities of million for the year ended september   which decreased million  or  compared to the prior year primarily due to lower risk management activity in the continued high price environment 
revenues from the distribution of fuel oil and refined fuels of million for the year ended september  decreased million  or  from million in the prior year 
fuel oil and refined fuels gallons sold in fiscal decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons compared to million gallons in the prior year 
lower volumes in our fuel oil and refined fuels segment were attributable primarily to our continued efforts to exit certain lower margin gasoline and low sulfur diesel businesses which resulted in an approximate decrease of million gallons  or of the total volume decline compared to the prior year 
average selling prices in our fuel oil and refined fuels segment increased as a result of the decreased emphasis on lower priced gasoline and diesel businesses 
the average posted price of fuel oil during fiscal decreased compared to the av erage posted prices in the prior year  yet increased sharply during september compared to the prior year 
revenues in our natural gas and electricity marketing segment decreased million  or  to million in fiscal primarily from lower volumes and lower average selling prices for both natural gas and electricity 
revenues in our hvac segment declined  to million during fiscal compared to million in the prior year  primarily as a result of the decision during the third quarter of fiscal to reorganize the hvac segment and to reduce the level of stand alone hvac installation activities 
the focus of our ongoing service offerings will be in support of our existing propane  refined fuels and natural gas and electricity segments  thus reducing overall hvac segment revenues

the cost of products sold reported in the consolidated statements of operations represents the weighted average unit cost of propane and fuel oil sold  as well as the cost of natural gas and electricity  including transportation costs to deliver product from our supply points to storage or to our customer service centers 
cost of products sold also includes the cost of appliances and related parts sold or installed by our customer service centers computed on a basis that approximates the average cost of the products 
unrealized non cash gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in each quarterly reporting period within cost of products sold 
cost of products sold is reported exclusive of any depreciation and amortization  these amounts are reported separately within the consolidated statements of operations 
cost of products sold decreased million  or  to million for the year ended september   compared to  million in the prior year 
the decrease results primarily from the lower sales volumes described above  as well as the impact of various favorable market factors impacting our supply and risk management activities which provided incremental margin opportunities in fiscal we attribute approximately million of the fiscal margins to these favorable market conditions that may not be present in the future 
additionally  cost of products sold for fiscal included a million unrealized non cash loss representing the net change in fair values of derivative instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas  compared to a million unrealized non c ash gain in the prior year see item a of this annual report for information on our policies regarding the accounting for derivative instruments 
cost of products sold associated with the distribution of propane and related activities of million decreased million  or  compared to the prior year 
lower sales volumes resulted in a million decrease in cost of products sold during fiscal compared to the prior year  partially offset by higher commodity prices which had an unfavorable impact of million compared to the prior year 
in addition  the impact of mark to market adjustments for derivative instruments under sfas resulted in a million increase in cost of products sold as fiscal included a million unrealized non cash loss  compared to a million unrealized non cash gain in the prior year 
wholesale and risk management activities resulted in a million decrease in cost of products sold compared to the prior year due to lower risk management activities 
cost of products sold associated with our fuel oil and refined fuels segment of million decreased million  or  compared to the prior year 
lower sales volumes and lower commodity prices resulted in a decrease in cost of products sold of million and million  respectively  during fiscal compared to the prior year 
these declines were partially offset by the impact of mark to market adjustments for derivative instruments under sfas  which resulted in a million increase in cost of products sold as fiscal included a million unrealized non cash loss  compared to a million unrealized non cash gain in the prior year 
cost of products sold in our natural gas and electricity segment of million decreased million  or  compared to prior year primarily due to lower revenues 
cost of products sold in our hvac segment of million decreased million  or  compared to prior year primarily due to lower revenues and a charge of million in fiscal to reduce the carrying value of service inventory that is no longer actively marketed by our customer service centers 
for the year ended september   total cost of products sold represented of revenues compared to in the prior year  primarily as a result of an improved customer mix from our decision to exit certain lower margin customers in both the propane and fuel oil and refined fuels segments  as well as the impact of various favorable market factors impacting our supply and risk management activities and the lower hvac activities

all costs of operating our retail distribution and appliance sales and service operations are reported within operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
these operating expenses include the compensation and benefits of field and direct operating support personnel  costs of operating and maintaining our vehicle fleet  overhead and other costs of our purchasing  training and safety departments and other direct and indirect costs of operating our customer service centers 
operating expenses of million for the year ended september  decreased million  or  compared to million in the prior year  which included an additional week of operations 
in fiscal  we realized the full year effect of the operating efficiencies  lower headcount and lower vehicle count resulting from our field and hvac reorganizations that began at the end of the third quarter of fiscal and continued into the beginning of fiscal the most significant cost savings were experienced in payroll and benefit related expenses which declined million  as well as a decrease of million in vehicle expenditures and savings in other costs of million to operate our customer service centers 
these cost savings were offset to an extent by a million increase in variable compensation resulting from the improved earnings in fiscal compared to the prior year 
in ad dition  fiscal operating expenses include a non cash pension settlement charge of million  which was million lower than the prior year charge of million  in order to accelerate the recognition of a portion of unrecognized actuarial losses in our defined benefit pension plan as a result of the level of lump sum retirement benefit payments made during each of the respective fiscal years

all costs of our back office support functions  including compensation and benefits for executives and other support functions  as well as other costs and expenses to maintain finance and accounting  treasury  legal  human resources  corporate development and the information systems functions are reported within general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended september  were million  or  lower compared to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a million reduction in professional services fees incurred in the prior year associated with the gp exchange transaction consummated on october   as well as million in higher costs incurred in the prior year associated with our field realignment effort 
the reduction in professional services fees also includes a million gain from our recovery of a substantial portion of legal fees associated with our successful defense of a matter following the acquisition of certain propane assets in north and south carolina 
these cost savings were offset to an extent by a million increase in variable compensation resulting from the improved earnings in fiscal compared to the pr ior year 
restructuring charges and severance costs 
for the year ended september   we recorded a charge of million related to severance costs incurred associated with positions eliminated during fiscal unrelated to a specific plan of restructuring

net interest expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal during fiscal  there were no borrowings under our working capital facility as seasonal working capital needs have been funded through improved cash flow and cash on hand  resulting in lower interest expense 
in the prior year period  average borrowings under our working capital facility amounted to million with a peak borrowing level of million 
additionally  as a result of increased cash on hand  interest income on invested cash has increased compared to the prior year  thus reducing net interest expense 
discontinued operations 
during the first quarter of fiscal  in a non cash transaction  we completed a transaction in which we disposed of nine customer service centers considered to be non strategic in exchange for three customer service centers of another company located in alaska 
we reported a million gain within discontinued operations in the first quarter of fiscal for the amount by which the fair value of assets relinquished exceeded the carrying value of the assets relinquished 
as part of our overall business strategy  we continually monitor and evaluate existing operations in order to identify opportunities to optimize return on assets by selectively divesting operations in slower growing or non strategic markets 
during fiscal  we also sold three customer service centers for net cash proceeds of millio n and recorded a gain on sale of million which has been accounted for in accordance with sfas on october   we completed the sale of our tirzah  south carolina underground granite propane storage cavern  and associated mile pipeline  for approximately million in net proceeds 
the million gallon underground storage cavern is connected to the dixie pipeline and provides propane storage for the eastern united states 
as part of the agreement  we entered into a long term storage arrangement with the purchaser of the cavern that will enable us to continue to meet the needs of our retail operations  consistent with past practices 
as a result of this sale  a gain of approximately million will be reported as a gain from the disposal of discontinued operations in our results for the first quarter of fiscal the results of operations from the tirzah facilities have been reported within discontinued operations 
because the transaction closed subsequent to the end of fiscal  our cash on hand at september nbsp  does not include the approximate million of net proceeds from the sale 
net income and ebitda 
we reported net income of million  or per common unit  for the year ended september  compared to net income of million  or per common unit  in the prior year 
ebitda for fiscal of million increased million  or  compared to ebitda of million in the prior year 
net income and ebitda for fiscal included i the non cash pension settlement charge of million  ii severance costs of million related to positions eliminated  iii a gain of million from the recovery of a substantial portion of legal fees associated with the successful defense of a matter following the acquisition of certain propane assets in north and south carolina  iv gains reported within discontinued operations of million from the sale and exchange of customer service centers considered to be non strategic  and v a non cash adjustment to the provision for income taxes deferred taxes of million 
by comparison  ebitda and net income for fiscal were unfavorably impacted by million and million  respectively  as a result of certain significant items relating mainly to i million of restructuring charges primarily related to severance benefits associated with our field realignment and the restructuring of our hvac business  ii incremental professional services fees of million associated with the gp exchange transaction consummated on october   iii a non cash pension settlement charge of million  iv a charge of million within cost of products sold to reduce the carrying value of service inventory that will no longer be marketed by our customer service centers  and v million included within depreciation and amortization expense attributable to impairment of assets affected by the field realignment 
ebitda represents net income before deducting interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
our management uses ebitda as a measure of liquidity and we are including it because we believe that it provides our investors and industry analysts with additional information to evaluate our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to pay our quarterly distributions to holders of our common units 
in addition  certain of our incentive compensation plans covering executives and other employees utilize ebitda as the performance target 
we use this non gaap financial measure in order to assist industry analysts and investors in assessing our liquidity on a year over year basis 
moreover  our revolving credit agreement requires us to use ebitda as a component in calculating our leverage and interest coverage ratios 
ebitda is not a recognized term under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash provided by operati ng activities determined in accordance with gaap 
because ebitda as determined by us excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income  it may not be comparable to ebitda or similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the following table sets forth i our calculations of ebitda and ii a reconciliation of ebitda  as so calculated  to our net cash provided by operating activities

total revenues increased million  or  to  million for the year ended september  compared to  million for the year ended september   driven primarily by higher average selling prices resulting from significantly higher commodity prices  offset to an extent by lower volumes in our propane and fuel oil and refined fuels segments 
as reported by noaa  average temperatures in our service territories were warmer than normal for fiscal compared to warmer than normal temperatures in fiscal while the fiscal heating season began with temperatures that were warmer than normal in the first quarter  significantly warmer than normal temperatures  particularly during the critical heating months of january and february which were warmer than normal  had a significant negative impact on volumes sold 
in the commodities markets  the high propane and fuel oil price s experienced throughout fiscal continued into fiscal  thus continuing to negatively impact volumes as a result of customer conservation 
revenues from the distribution of propane and related activities of  million for the year ended september  increased million  or  compared to million in the prior year  primarily due to the impact of higher average selling prices in line with significantly higher product costs  offset to an extent by the impact of lower volumes 
retail propane gallons sold in fiscal decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons from million gallons in the prior year 
propane volumes sold were negatively affected by the impact of warmer weather  customer conservation efforts  and our effort to focus on higher margin residential customers 
average propane selling prices increased as a result of higher commodity prices for propane 
the average posted price of propane during fiscal increased compared to the average posted prices in the prior year 
additionally  included within the propane segment are revenues from wholesale and risk management activities of million for the year ended september  which was comparable to the prior year 
revenues from the distribution of fuel oil and refined fuels of million for the year ended september  decreased million  or  from million in the prior year 
sales of fuel oil and refined fuels amounted to million gallons during fiscal compared to million gallons in the prior year  a decrease of million gallons  or 
lower volumes in our fuel oil and refined fuels segment were attributable primarily to our continued efforts to exit certain lower margin diesel and gasoline businesses which resulted in an approximate decrease of million gallons compared to the prior year  combined with the impact of high prices on fuel oil volumes  as well as the impact on volumes from the decision to eliminate the fiscal year fuel oil ceiling program ceiling program 
average selling prices in our fuel oil and refined fuels segment increa sed as a result of higher fuel oil commodity prices  coupled with the decreased emphasis on lower priced diesel and gasoline businesses and the shift in our pricing strategy at the field level following the elimination of the restrictions from the ceiling program 
the average posted price of fuel oil during fiscal increased compared to the average posted prices in the prior year 
revenues for the year ended september  were favorably impacted by an increase in our natural gas and electricity segment  which increased to million from million in the prior year  primarily as a result of a rise in electricity volumes coupled with increases in average selling prices for natural gas and electricity in line with higher commodity prices 
revenues in our hvac segment declined  to million during fiscal compared to million in the prior year  primarily as a result of the decision during the third quarter of fiscal to reorganize the hvac segment and to reduce the level of hvac installation activities 
the focus of our ongoing service offerings will be in support of our existing propane  refined fuels and natural gas and electricity segments  thus reducing overall hvac segment revenues

cost of products sold decreased million to  million for the year ended september   compared to  million in the prior year 
the decrease results primarily from the lower sales volumes described above  offset to an extent by higher commodity prices for propane and fuel oil 
cost of products sold for fiscal include a million unrealized non cash gain representing the net change in fair values of derivative instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas nos 
  and sfas  compared to a million unrealized non cash loss in the prior year see item a of this annual report for information on our policies regarding the accounting for derivative instruments 
cost of products sold associated with the distribution of propane and related activities of million increased million  or  compared to the prior year 
higher propane prices resulted in a million increase in cost of products sold during fiscal compared to the prior year  partially offset by decreased propane volumes which had an impact of million 
wholesale and risk management activities resulted in a million increase in cost of products sold compared to the prior year 
cost of products sold associated with our fuel oil and refined fuels segment of million decreased million  or  compared to the prior year 
lower sales volumes resulted in a million decrease in cost of products sold during fiscal compared to the prior year  partially offset by higher commodity prices which had an impact of million compared to the prior year 
cost of products sold as a percentage of revenues in our fuel oil and refined fuels segment decreased from during fiscal to in fiscal primarily as a result of the elimination of the ceiling program which had the effect of restricting fuel oil margin opportunities in fiscal the ceiling program primarily affected deliveries from february through april as a result of the decision not to hedge the program  however  the inability to pass on the significant rise in the commodity prices throughout fiscal significantl y affected margin opportunities 
the lost margin opportunity from this fuel oil ceiling program had an estimated negative impact of million on fiscal operating margins in the fuel oil and refined fuels segment 
by eliminating this pricing program beginning in fiscal  we no longer incur the costs of hedging deliveries made under the program and we have been successful in implementing our market based pricing strategies in our field operations  without significant customer losses 
the increase in revenues attributable to our natural gas and electricity segment had a million impact on cost of products sold for the year ended september  compared to the prior year 
cost of products sold in our hvac segment declined million as a result of lower revenues  partially offset by a charge of million to reduce the carrying value of inventory that will no longer be actively marketed by our customer service centers 
for the year ended september   total cost of products sold represented of revenues compared to in the prior year  primarily as a result of the improved pricing strategy in the fuel oil operations following the elimination of the ceiling program  as well as the improved customer mix from our decision to exit certain lower margin customers in both the propane and fuel oil and refined fuels segments

operating expenses of million for the year ended september  decreased million  or  compared to million in the prior year  primarily as a result of cost savings achieved through the aforementioned field realignment efforts and restructuring of our hvac service offerings 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we initiated plans to realign our field operations and  as a second phase of our field realignment  during the third quarter of fiscal we initiated plans to restructure our hvac service offerings by reducing our hvac installation activities 
these efforts have significantly restructured our operating footprint and reduced our cost structure through the elimination of more than positions and the retirement of nearly vehicles from our fleet through the creation of routing efficiencies  generating significant savings in our fixed cost structure 
as a result  payroll and benefit related ex penses declined million and savings in other operating expenses amounted to million 
in addition  bad debt expense decreased million from improved collection efforts 
these cost savings were offset to an extent by a million increase in variable compensation resulting from the improved earnings in fiscal compared to the prior year 
additionally  fiscal operating expenses include a million non cash pension settlement charge in order to accelerate the recognition of a portion of unrecognized actuarial losses in our defined benefit pension plan as a result of the level of lump sum benefit payments made during fiscal from the reduction in headcount

net interest expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal as a result of increased borrowings under our working capital facility during the fiscal heating season compared to the prior year 
discontinued operations 
discontinued operations reflect the income associated with the assets sold in the tirzah sale of million and million for fiscal year and  respectively 
during fiscal  we also recorded a gain on sale of million to reflect the finalization of certain purchase price adjustments with the buyer of the customer service centers sold in fiscal net income loss and ebitda 
we reported net income of million for the year ended september  compared to a net loss of million in the prior year 
ebitda for fiscal of million increased million  or  compared to adjusted ebitda of million in the prior year 
ebitda and net income for fiscal were unfavorably impacted by million and million  respectively  as a result of certain significant items relating mainly to i million of restructuring charges primarily related to severance benefits associated with our field realignment and the restructuring of our hvac business  ii incremental professional services fees of million associated with the gp exchange transaction consummated on october   iii a non cash pension settlement charge of million  iv a charge of million within cost of products sold to reduce the carrying value of inventory that will no longer be marketed by our customer service centers  and v million included within depreciation and amortization expense attributable to impairment of assets affected by the field realignment 
by comparison  adjusted ebitda and net loss for fiscal were unfavorably impacted by million and million  respectively  as a result of certain significant items relating mainly to i a million loss on debt extinguishment associated with our march  debt refinancing  ii a million restructuring charge attributable primarily to severance associated with the realignment of our field operations  iii a million charge attributable to impairment of goodwill associated with our hvac segment  iv a million charge included within amortization expense attributable to the impairment of other intangible assets in our hvac segment  and v million included within depreciation expense attributable to impairment of assets affected by the field realignment 
in addition to the non recurring items impacting fiscal results  the most significant negative impact on operating results was from the approximate million impact on margin opportunities in our fuel oil business from the ceiling program 
ebitda represents net income before deducting interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
our management uses ebitda as a measure of liquidity and we are including it because we believe that it provides our investors and industry analysts with additional information to evaluate our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to pay our quarterly distributions to holders of our common units 
in addition  certain of our incentive compensation plans covering executives and other employees utilize ebitda as the performance target 
we use the term adjusted ebitda to reflect the presentation of ebitda for the year ended september  exclusive of the impact of the non cash charge for loss on debt extinguishment in the amount of million 
we use this non gaap financial measure in order to assist industry analysts and investors in assessing our liquidity on a year over year basis 
moreover  our revolving credit agreement requires us to use ebitda or adjusted ebitda as a component in calculating our leverage and interest coverage ratios 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized terms under gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with gaap 
because ebitda as determined by us excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income  it may not be comparable to ebitda or similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the following table sets forth i our calculations of ebitda and adjusted ebitda and ii a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda  as so calculated  to our net cash provided by operating activities

liquidity and capital resources analysis of cash flows operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended september  amounted to million  a decrease of million compared to million in the prior year

the fiscal voluntary pension plan contribution of million was made to fully fund our estimated accumulated benefit obligation  thus substantially reducing  if not eliminating  our future funding requirements 
as of september   the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan was million  or funded 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million  compared to million in fiscal the increase was attributable to an million decreased investment in working capital in comparison to the prior year  particularly in decreased accounts receivable balances as a result of steps taken during fiscal to improve collection efforts  coupled with million higher income  after adjusting for non cash items in both periods depreciation  amortization  pension settlement charge  loss on debt extinguishment  impairment of goodwill and gains on disposal of assets and customer service centers  offset to an extent by a decrease in other long term assets and liabilities of million

capital spending in fiscal decreased million  or  compared to fiscal primarily as a result of i efforts to consolidate existing storage assets for better utilization in conjunction with our fiscal field realignment efforts thereby reducing fiscal spending needs  and ii a reduction from fiscal spending on information technology for the integration of agway energy 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended september  of million reflects quarterly distributions to common unitholders at a rate of per common unit in respect of the fourth quarter of fiscal  at a rate of per common unit in respect of the first quarter of fiscal  at a rate of per common unit in respect of the second quarter of fiscal and at a rate of per common unit in respect of the third quarter of fiscal there were no borrowings under our working capital facility during fiscal  nor have there been any borrowings since april net cash used in financing activities for the year ended september  of million reflects the repayment of short term borrowings of million under our revolving credit agreement and quarterly distributions to common unitholders and the general partner at a rate of per common unit in respect of the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first and second quarters of fiscal and at a rate of per common unit in respect of the third quarter of fiscal totaling million 
this distribution amount includes a million payment made to the general partner reflecting a true up of previous underpayments resulting from an error in the computation of quarterly cash distributions to the general partner 
during fiscal  borrowings under the working capital facility reached million during the peak heating season  which was fully repaid by the end of april summary of long term debt obligations and revolving credit lines our long term borrowings and revolving credit lines consist of million in senior notes due december the senior notes and a revolving credit agreement at the operating partnership level which provides a five year million term loan due march  the term loan and a separate working capital facility which provides available credit up to million 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the working capital facility as of september  there have been no borrowings under our working capital facility since april we have standby letters of credit issued under the working capital facility of the revolving credit agreement in the aggregate amount of million in support of retention levels under our self insurance programs and certain lease obligations 
therefore  as of september  we had available borrowing capacity of million under the working capital facility of the revolving credit agreement 
additionally  under the third amendment to the revolving credit agreement our operating partnership is authorized to incur additional indebtedness of up to million in connection with capital leases and up to million in short term borro wings during the period from december to april in each fiscal year in order to meet working capital needs during periods of peak demand  if necessary 
because of our operating results and cash flow  we did not make any such short term borrowings during fiscal the senior notes mature on december  and require semi annual interest payments 
we are permitted to redeem some or all of the senior notes any time on or after december  at redemption prices specified in the indenture governing the senior notes 
in addition  the senior notes have a change of control provision that would require us to offer to repurchase the notes at of the principal amount repurchased  if the holders of the notes elected to exercise the right of repurchase 
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement  including the term loan  bear interest at a rate based upon either libor or wachovia national bank s prime rate plus  in each case  the applicable margin 
an annual facility fee ranging from to  based upon certain financial tests  is payable quarterly whether or not borrowings occur 
in connection with the term loan  our operating partnership also entered into an interest rate swap contract with a notional amount of million with the issuing lender 
effective march  through march   our operating partnership will pay a fixed interest rate of to the issuing lender on the notional principal amount of million  effectively fixing the libor portion of the interest rate at 
in return  the issuing lender will pay to our operating partnership a floating rate  namely libor  on the same notional principal amount 
the applicable margin above libor  as defined in the revolving credit agreement  will be paid in addition to this fixed interest rate of 
under the revolving credit agreement  our operating partnership must maintain a leverage ratio the ratio of total debt to ebitda of less than to and an interest coverage ratio the ratio of ebitda to interest expense of greater than to at the partnership level 
the revolving credit agreement and the senior notes both contain various restrictive and affirmative covenants applicable to our operating partnership and us  respectively 
these covenants include i restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and ii restrictions on certain liens  investments  guarantees  loans  advances  payments  mergers  consolidations  distributions  sales of assets and other transactions 
we were in compliance with all covenants and terms of all of our debt agreements as of september  partnership distributions we are required to make distributions in an amount equal to all of our available cash  as defined in the third amended and restated partnership agreement  as amended  no more than days after the end of each fiscal quarter to holders of record on the applicable record dates 
available cash  as defined in the partnership agreement  generally means all cash on hand at the end of the respective fiscal quarter less the amount of cash reserves established by the board of supervisors in its reasonable discretion for future cash requirements 
these reserves are retained for the proper conduct of our business  the payment of debt principal and interest and for distributions during the next four quarters 
the board of supervisors reviews the level of available cash on a quarterly basis based upon information provided by management 
as a result of the gp exchange transaction  all idrs formerly held by the general partner have been cancelled and the general partner is no t entitled to receive any cash distributions in respect of its general partner interests 
accordingly  beginning with the quarterly distribution paid on november  in respect of the fourth quarter of fiscal  of all cash distributions are paid to the holders of common units  including the million common units issued in the gp exchange transaction 
on october   we announced a quarterly distribution of per common unit  or on an annualized basis  in respect of the fourth quarter of fiscal payable on november  to holders of record on november  this quarterly distribution included an increase of per common unit  or per common unit on an annualized basis  from the previous quarterly distribution rate representing the fifteenth increase since our recapitalization in and a increase in the quarterly distribution rate since the fourth quarter of the prior year 
pension plan assets and obligations our defined benefit pension plan was frozen to new participants effective january  and  in furtherance of our effort to minimize future increases in our benefit obligations  effective january   all future service credits were eliminated 
therefore  eligible participants will receive interest credits only toward their ultimate defined benefit under the defined benefit pension plan 
there were no minimum funding requirements for the defined benefit pension plan during fiscal  or during  we made a voluntary cash contribution from cash on hand of million to our defined benefit pension plan in order to fully fund our estimated accumulated benefit obligation  thus substantially reducing  if not eliminating  our future funding requirements 
as a result of our voluntary contributions and improved asset returns in our pension asset portfolio during the last several years  the fair value of plan assets exce eded the accumulated benefit obligation of the defined benefit pension plan by million as of september  this overfunded position resulted in the elimination of the additional minimum liability of million with a corresponding increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss  a component of partners capital 
at the end of fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas  which requires companies to recognize the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability on sponsoring employers balance sheets and to recognize changes in the funded status in comprehensive income loss in the year the changes occur 
this adoption resulted in a million reduction to the prepaid pension asset and a million decrease to accrued postretirement liability  with the net amount of million recorded as a reduction in the net assets of the partnership to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
as of september   the fair value of plan assets exceeded the projected benefit obligation of the defi ned benefit pension plan by million  which was recognized on the balance sheet as an asset in accordance with sfas during fiscal  lump sum benefit payments of million exceeded the combined service and interest costs of the net periodic pension cost 
as a result  pursuant to sfas no 
employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  we recorded a non cash settlement charge of million in order to accelerate recognition of a portion of cumulative unrecognized losses in the defined benefit pension plan 
these unrecognized losses were previously accumulated as a reduction to partners capital and were being amortized to expense as part of our net periodic pension cost in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions 
a similar non cash pension settlement charge of million was recorded in fiscal as a result of the level of lump sum benefit payments 
additional pension settlement ch arges may be required in future periods depending on the level of lump sum benefit payments 
the partnership s investment policies and strategies  as set forth in the investment management policy and guidelines  are monitored by a benefits committee comprised of five members of management 
during fiscal  the benefits committee proposed and the board of supervisors approved contributions to the plan in order to fully fund the accumulated benefit obligation  as described above  and to change the plan s asset allocation to reduce investment risk and more closely match the asset mix to the future cash requirements of the plan 
the implementation of this strategy resulted in the million voluntary contribution described above  and a change in the asset allocation to reflect a greater concentration of fixed income securities 
there can be no assurance that future declines in capital markets  or interest rates  will not have an adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flow 
however  with the overfunded status of the plan  coupled with the shift in investment strategy to a higher concentration of fixed income securities  we expect over the long term that the returns on plan assets should match increases in the accumulated benefit obligation resulting from interest credits  this maintaining a fully funded status 
for purposes of computing the actuarial valuation of projected benefit obligations  we increased the discount rate assumption from as of september  to as of september  to reflect current market expectations related to long term interest rates and the projected duration of our pension obligations based on a benchmark index with similar characteristics as the expected cash flow requirements of our defined benefit pension plan over the long term 
additionally  for purposes of the computation of the net periodic pension cost for fiscal  and we assumed increased long term rates of return on plan assets of  and  respectively  based on the investment mix of our pension asset portfolio  historical asset performance and expectations for future performance 
for purposes of the computation of the net periodic pension cost for fiscal  we expect the rate of return on plan assets will be reduced to reflect the higher concentration of fixed income securities 
based on information provided by our actuaries  we do not project any future funding requirements 
we also provide postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees 
partnership employees who were hired prior to july and retired prior to march are eligible for such benefits if they reached a specific retirement age while working for the partnership 
effective january   we terminated our postretirement benefit plan for all eligible employees retiring after march  all active and eligible employees who were to receive benefits under the postretirement plan subsequent to march  were provided an increase to their accumulated benefits under the defined benefit pension plan 
our postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans are unfunded 
long term debt obligations and operating lease obligations contractual obligations long term debt obligations and future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating lease agreements as of september  are due as follows

additionally  we have standby letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million  in support of retention levels under our casualty insurance programs and certain lease obligations  which expire periodically through october  operating leases we lease certain property  plant and equipment for various periods under noncancelable operating leases  including approximately of our vehicle fleet  approximately of our customer service centers and portions of our information systems equipment 
rental expense under operating leases was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating lease agreements as of september  are presented in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees we have residual value guarantees associated with certain of our operating leases  related primarily to transportation equipment  with remaining lease periods scheduled to expire periodically through fiscal upon completion of the lease period  we guarantee that the fair value of the equipment will equal or exceed the guaranteed amount  or we will pay the lessor the difference 
although the fair value of equipment at the end of its lease term has historically exceeded the guaranteed amounts  the maximum potential amount of aggregate future payments we could be required to make under these leasing arrangements  assuming the equipment is deemed worthless at the end of the lease term  is approximately million 
the fair value of residual value guarantees for outstanding operating leases was as of september  and september  recently issued accounting standards in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we enter into product supply contracts that are generally one year agreements subject to annual renewal  and also purchase product on the open market 
our propane supply contracts typically provide for pricing based upon index formulas using the posted prices established at major supply points such as mont belvieu  texas  or conway  kansas plus transportation costs at the time of delivery 
in addition  to supplement our annual purchase requirements  we may utilize forward fixed price purchase contracts to acquire a portion of the propane that we resell to our customers  which allows us to manage our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity prices and to assure adequate physical supply 
the percentage of contract purchases  and the amount of supply contracted for under forward contracts at fixed prices  will vary from year to year based on market conditions 
in certain instances  and when market conditions are favorable as was the case in the fuel oil marke t during the first half of fiscal  we are able to purchase product under our supply arrangements at a discount to the market 
product cost changes can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact profitability 
we attempt to reduce price risk by pricing product on a short term basis 
the level of priced  physical product maintained in storage facilities and at our customer service centers for immediate sale to our customers will vary depending on several factors  including  but not limited to  price  availability of supply and demand given the time of year 
typically  our on hand priced position does not exceed more than four weeks of our supply needs and  during the peak heating season  typically not more than two weeks of supply is maintained in inventory 
in the course of normal operations  we routinely enter into contracts such as forward priced physical contracts for the purchase or sale of propane and fuel oil that  under sfas  qualify for and are designated as a normal purchase or normal sale contract 
such contracts are exempted from the fair value accounting re quirements of sfas and are accounted for at the time product is purchased or sold under the related contract 
under our hedging and risk management strategies  we enter into a combination of exchange traded futures and option contracts  forward contracts and  in certain instances  over the counter options collectively  derivative instruments to manage the price risk associated with priced  physical product and with future purchases of the commodities used in our operations  principally propane and fuel oil  as well as to ensure the availability of product during periods of high demand 
futures and forward contracts require that we sell or acquire propane or fuel oil at a fixed price for delivery at fixed future dates 
an option contract allows  but does not require  its holder to buy or sell propane or fuel oil at a specified price during a specified time period 
however  the writer of an option contract must fulfill the obligation of the option contract  should the holder choose to exercise the option 
at expiration  the contracts are sett led by the delivery of the product to the respective party or are settled by the payment of a net amount equal to the difference between the then current price and the fixed contract price 
to the extent that we utilize derivative instruments to manage exposure to commodity price risk and commodity prices move adversely in relation to the contracts  we could suffer losses on those derivative instruments when settled 
conversely  if prices move favorably  we could realize gains 
as a result of various market factors during the first half of fiscal  particularly commodity price volatility during the first four months of the fiscal year  we experienced additional margin opportunities due to favorable pricing under certain supply arrangements and from our hedging and risk management activities 
we attribute approximately million of the fiscal profitability to the favorable supply and market factors 
however  supply and risk management transactions may not always result in increased product margins and there can be no assurance that these favorable market conditions will be present in the future in order to provide the additional margin opportunities realized during fiscal 
table of contents market risk we are subject to commodity price risk to the extent that propane or fuel oil market prices deviate from fixed contract settlement amounts 
futures traded with brokers on the nymex require daily cash settlements in margin accounts 
forward and option contracts are generally settled at the expiration of the contract term either by physical delivery or through a net settlement mechanism 
market risks associated with the trading of futures  options and forward contracts are monitored daily for compliance with our hedging and risk management policy which includes volume limits for open positions 
open inventory positions are reviewed and managed daily as to exposures to changing market prices 
credit risk futures and fuel oil options are guaranteed by the nymex and  as a result  have minimal credit risk 
we are subject to credit risk with forward and option contracts to the extent the counterparties do not perform 
we evaluate the financial condition of each counterparty with which we conduct business and establish credit limits to reduce exposure to credit risk of non performance 
interest rate risk a portion of our long term borrowings bear interest at a variable rate based upon either libor or wachovia national bank s prime rate  plus an applicable margin depending on the level of our total leverage 
therefore  we are subject to interest rate risk on the variable component of the interest rate 
we manage our interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
on march   we entered into a million interest rate swap contract in conjunction with the term loan facility under the revolving credit agreement 
the interest rate swap is being accounted for under sfas and has been designated as a cash flow hedge 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are recognized in other comprehensive loss income oci until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
at september   the fair value of the interest rate swap was million representing an unreali zed loss and was included within other liabilities 
derivative instruments and hedging activities all of our derivative instruments are reported on the balance sheet  within other current assets or other current liabilities  at their fair values pursuant to sfas on the date that futures  forward and option contracts are entered into  we make a determination as to whether the derivative instrument qualifies for designation as a hedge 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded each period in current period earnings or oci  depending on whether a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and  if so  the type of hedge 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  we formally assess  both at the hedge contract s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the hedge contract is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported in oci to the extent effective and reclassified into cost of products sol d during the same period in which the hedged item affects earnings 
the mark to market gains or losses on ineffective portions of cash flow hedges used to hedge future purchases are immediately recognized in cost of products sold 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges  and that do not meet the normal purchase and normal sale exemption under sfas  are recorded within cost of products sold as they occur 
at september   the fair value of derivative instruments described above resulted in derivative assets unrealized gains of million included within prepaid expenses and other current assets and derivative liabilities unrealized losses of million included within other current liabilities 
cost of products sold included unrealized non cash losses in the amount of million for the year ended september  compared to unrealized non cash gains of million for the year ended september   attributable to the change in fair value of derivative instruments not designated as cash flow hedges 
as of september   unrealized gains on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges in the amount of million were included in oci and are expected to be recognized in earnings during the next months as the hedged transactions occur 

table of contents sensitivity analysis in an effort to estimate our exposure to unfavorable market price changes in propane or fuel oil related to our open positions under derivative instruments  we developed a model that incorporates the following data and assumptions

based on the sensitivity analysis described above  the hypothetical adverse change in market prices for each of the future months for which a future  forward and or option contract exists indicates either future losses or a reduction in potential future gains of million as of september  the above hypothetical change does not reflect the worst case scenario 
actual results may be significantly different depending on market conditions and the composition of the open position portfolio 
the average posted price of propane on september  at mont belvieu  texas a major storage point was per gallon as compared to per gallon on september  the average posted price of fuel oil on september  at linden  new jersey was per gallon as compared to per gallon on september  the average posted price of propane on november  at mont belvieu  texas was per gallon  representing a increase since the end of fiscal the average posted price of fuel oil on november  at linden  new jersey was per gallon  representing a increase since the end of fiscal as of september   our open positions under derivative instruments reflected a net short position sell contracts aggregating million
