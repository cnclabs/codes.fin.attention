overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of monoclonal  antibody based products for the targeted treatment of cancer  autoimmune and other serious diseases 
we have developed a number of advanced proprietary technologies that allow us to create humanized antibodies that can be used either alone in unlabeled  or naked  form  or conjugated with radioactive isotopes  chemotherapeutics or toxins  in each case to create highly targeted agents 
using these technologies  we have built a broad pipeline of therapeutic product candidates that utilize several different mechanisms of action 
we believe that our portfolio of intellectual property  which includes issued patents in the us and approximately other issued patents worldwide  protects our product candidates and technologies 
we have transitioned our focus away from the development of diagnostic imaging products in order to accelerate the development of our therapeutic product candidates  although we continue to manufacture and commercialize leukoscan in territories where regulatory approvals have been granted 
as of june   research and development into diagnostic product candidates was no longer a material portion of our business 
from inception in until june   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million and have never earned a profit 
in the absence of increased revenues from the sale of current or future products and licensing activities the amount  timing  nature or source of which cannot be predicted  our losses will continue as we continue to conduct our research and development activities 
these activities are budgeted to expand over time and will require further resources if we are to be successful 
as a result  our operating losses are likely to be substantial over the next several years 
the development and commercialization of successful therapeutic products is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including  without limitation  the following the type of therapeutic compound under investigation and nature of the disease in connection with which the compound is being studied  our ability  as well as the ability of our partners  to conduct and complete clinical trials on a timely basis  the time required for us to comply with all applicable federal  state and foreign legal requirements  including  without limitation  our receipt of the necessary approvals of the us food and drug administration  or fda  the financial resources available to us during any particular period  and many other factors associated with the commercial development of therapeutic products outside of our control 
research and development as of june   we employed professionals in our research and development departments and professionals in our clinical research departments 
in addition to salaries and benefits  the other costs associated with research and development include the costs associated with producing biopharmaceutical compounds  laboratory equipment and supplies  the costs of conducting clinical trials  legal fees and expenses associated with pursuing patent protection  as well as facilities costs 
we have spent approximately million in the aggregate in the fiscal year ended june  on research and development expenses  million in the aggregate in the fiscal year ended june  on research and development expenses  and million in the aggregate for the year ended june  on research and development expenses 
with the completion in fiscal year of the manufacturing expansion to support our research and development efforts and prepare for future commercialization of our product candidates  we believe that our facilities are adequate to support our research and development activities for the next few years without the need for any material capital expenditures 
at any one time our scientists are engaged in the research and development of multiple therapeutic compounds 
because we do not track expenses on the basis of each individual compound under investigation  but rather aggregate research and development costs for accounting purposes  it is not possible for investors to analyze and compare the expenses associated with unsuccessful research and development efforts for any particular fiscal period  with those associated with compounds that are determined to be worthy of further development 
this may make it more difficult for investors to evaluate our business and future prospects 
therapeutics we believe that each of our antibodies has therapeutic potential either when administered alone or when conjugated with therapeutic radioisotopes radiolabeled  chemotherapeutics or other toxins to create unique and potentially more effective treatment options 
the attachment of various compounds to antibodies is intended to allow the delivery of these therapeutic agents to tumor sites with greater precision than conventional radiation therapy or chemotherapeutic approaches 
this treatment method is designed to reduce the total exposure of the patient to the therapeutic agents  which ideally minimizes debilitating side effects 
we are currently focusing our efforts on unlabeled  or naked antibodies and antibodies conjugated with drugs or toxins  and to lesser extent on the use of radioisotopes  such as yttrium  sometimes referred to as y  and iodine  sometimes referred to as i epratuzumab our most advanced therapeutic product candidate  immu  is an unlabeled humanized antibody which targets an antigen  known as the cd marker  found on the surface of b lymphocytes  a type of white blood cells 
since b lymphocytes are involved in the production of autoantibodies  we reasoned that epratuzumab might show activity in the treatment of autoimmune diseases by affecting b cell levels and function 
our humanized cd antibody has been shown not to evoke any substantial anti epratuzumab antibodies in nhl patients  even after repeated dosing  making it a good candidate for treating patients with a chronic  non malignant disease 
in april  clinical results of epratuzumab in patients with sle were published in arthritis research therapy 
the objective of this open label  single center study was to evaluate the safety  tolerability  lack of immunogenicity and early evidence of efficacy of epratuzumab  which was administered as a single agent every other week  for a total of four doses 
a scoring system called bilag british isle lupus assessment group was used to measure the level of disease activity in these patients prior to  and  at several time points  post administration of epratuzumab 
patients with mild to moderate systemic lupus erythematosus sle activity defined by global bilag scores of prior to treatment were enrolled 
a high bilag score indicates increased disease activity 
sle assessments after treatment demonstrated consistent clinical improvement  with decreased global bilag scores for all fourteen enrolled patients compared to the pre therapy scores 
specifically  had lowered their global bilag scores by or more six weeks post therapy 
furthermore  having decreases of various amounts continuing to at least weeks where showed a decrease 
almost all patients experienced improvements in at least one bilag b or c level disease activity at  and weeks 
additionally  patients with multiple bilag b involvement at baseline had completely resolved all b level disease activities by weeks 
in all patients  the treatment was well tolerated with infusions completed in about one hour  and no evidence of reactions or immunogenicity 
based on these positive results  we submitted an application with the fda for fast track designation and in january  received notice from the agency granting epratuzumab fast track product designation for the treatment of patients with moderate and severe sle 
the fast track programs of the fda are designed to facilitate drug development and to expedite the review of new drugs that are intended to treat serious or life threatening conditions  and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs 
as such  the fast track designation allows for close and frequent interaction with the agency 
a designated fast track drug may also be considered for priority review with a shortened review time  rolling submission  and accelerated approval if applicable 
in may  we initiated two pivotal phase iii clinical trials to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of epratuzumab for the treatment of patients with moderate and severe sle 
these pivotal trials were randomized  double blinded  placebo controlled  multi center studies using the bilag index to monitor and assess disease activity 
the trials were named alleviate or alleviate lupus affliction with epratuzumab and validate its autoimmune safety and efficacy 
one trial  alleviate a  was for patients with severe sle flares  and the second trial  alleviate b  was for patients with moderately active sle 
with the consummation of the ucb agreement  future costs incurred related to these clinical trials were the responsibility of ucb 
another autoimmune indication that we are targeting with epratuzumab is sj gren s syndrome  a disease that currently affects between to million americans 
we reported results from our open label  non randomized  two center phase i ii trial in the july issue of arthritis research therapy 
sixteen patients with primary sj gren s syndrome were enrolled in this study to assess feasibility  safety  and early evidence of efficacy 
over an eight week period  patients received mg m of epratuzumab every two weeks for a total of four doses 
fourteen patients received all four infusions without reactions with a median infusion time of fifty minutes 
one patient received three and another was discontinued after receiving a partial infusion due to a mild acute reaction 
patients reported improvements in their clinical signs and symptoms that include dry eyes  dry mouth  fatigue  tender joints  tender points  tear and salivary flow 
specifically  achieved a clinical response at improvement level at weeks  with responding at weeks  responding at weeks  and responding at weeks 
approximately responded at the level  while responded at the level for weeks 
additionally  statistically significant improvements were observed in fatigue  and patient and physician global assessments 
epratuzumab seems to slow activity without causing a drastic drop in the number of circulating b lymphocytes  thus perhaps reducing the risk of infection 
consistent with our past clinical experience with the antibody  we have found a reduction of to in circulating b cells in the patients enrolled in both the sle and sj gren s syndrome trials 
this data suggests that b cell modulation may be the primary mechanism of action of epratuzumab  and that complete depletion of b cells is not necessary to provide a clinical benefit 
epratuzumab has also demonstrated good safety  tolerability  and clinical efficacy in more than patients with non hodgkin s lymphoma  resulting in reports published in the august and august issues of the journal of clinical oncology 
on may  we entered into a development  collaboration and license agreement the ucb agreement with ucb  providing ucb an exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture  market and sell epratuzumab for the treatment of all autoimmune disease indications 
under the terms of the ucb agreement  we retain the rights to develop epratuzumab in the field of oncology  and ucb has an option to acquire development and commercialization rights to epratuzumab with respect to cancer indications at anytime prior to the first commercial sales thereof 
if ucb exercises its buy in right with respect to epratuzumab in the field of oncology  ucb will reimburse us for the development cost actually incurred  plus a buy in fee 
under the terms of the ucb agreement  we received initial cash payments totaling million from ucb  which includes a million upfront payment  plus a million reimbursement for development costs of epratuzumab related to our clinical development of epratuzumab in patients with certain autoimmune conditions prior to the date of the ucb agreement 
in addition  if regulatory targets are achieved we are entitled to receive certain milestone payments  which could aggregate to a maximum of up to million in cash payments and million in equity investments 
these milestone payments are dependent upon specific achievements in the regulatory approval process under the ucb agreement 
we will also receive product royalties based upon a percentage of aggregate annual net sales under the ucb agreement during the product royalty term  which percentage is subject to reduction under certain circumstances 
in addition  we will receive sales bonuses of up to million if annual net sales reach certain target levels 
there can be no assurance these regulatory or sales achievements will be met and therefore there can be no assurance that we will receive such future payments 
we determined that all elements under the ucb agreement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting under eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in accordance with sab no 
topic  revenue recognition  deferral of revenue is appropriate regarding nonrefundable  upfront fees received in single unit of accounting arrangements 
as we have continuing obligations under the ucb agreement  we recorded the million payment as deferred revenue 
pursuant to the terms of the ucb agreement  ucb assumed the financial responsibilities of completing the clinical and regulatory submissions of epratuzumab for sle 
on september   ucb decided to temporarily suspend the clinical trials of epratuzumab for patients with sle 
this suspension was implemented due to ucb s concerns regarding the sterility assurance in the final product 
this was a voluntary precautionary step as there have been no reports of clinical safety issues regarding this matter 
as a result of this step  the food and drug administration  or the fda and certain other regulatory authorities instituted a clinical hold status of these trials 
on november  the fda notified ucb that the clinical hold on existing trials with epratuzumab in patients with lupus was lifted 
in january  ucb decided to stop further new patient enrollment into the sle clinical trials designed and initiated by the company 
investigators were advised by ucb of this decision  and protocol amendments have been submitted to institutional review boards to seek approval to treat patients with sle who demonstrated clinical benefit in these trials 
at that time  ucb and its experts in the field of sle believed that the existing clinical trial protocols should be revised  including potential changes to patient enrollment criteria as such changes may result in more rapid patient enrollment 
in early march  based on continuing discussions and information provided by ucb during the third quarter of fiscal  we determined that ucb terminated the sle clinical trials designed and initiated by immunomedics 
ucb and their experts in the field of sle have decided to establish new protocols under which new clinical trials for the treatment of sle would be conducted 
the clinical trial data from the recently stopped trials collected to date are valuable and are being analyzed as support for the new clinical trials 
the protocols for the new sle clinical trials will need to be reviewed and approved by the regulatory authorities 
as a result of the ucb decision  we are no longer able to determine when these clinical trials will take place nor can we determine how these decisions will impact our obligation period under the terms of the agreement with ucb 
accordingly  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  we ceased amortizing to revenue the deferred revenue recorded with the receipt of the up front payments from ucb at the inception of the license agreement until such time as the obligation period is reasonably determinable 
we have been advised by ucb that it remains committed to developing epratuzumab for the treatment of sle 
while the clinical results to date have been encouraging  we are not able to determine when  if ever  epratuzumab will be approved for sale in the us or anywhere else 
even if it is approved  there can be no assurance that it will be commercially successful or that we will ever receive revenues equal to our financial investment in this product candidate 
other therapeutic product candidates we also have in development a solid tumor therapeutic product candidate that targets an antigen known as carcinoembryonic antigen  or cea 
the cea antigen is abundant at the site of virtually all cancers of the colon and rectum and is associated with many other solid tumors  such as breast and lung cancers 
a phase ii trial has been completed in europe for immu hcea i in patients with proven or suspected metastatic colorectal cancer who failed chemotherapy 
we believe that the initial results with immu are encouraging 
this phase i ii trial with immu hcea y has completed enrollment in the united states and in europe in patients with advanced colorectal and pancreatic cancers 
we are not currently conducting clinical trials with our unlabeled cea antibody  however  we are providing clinical supplies for an investigator sponsored phase ii clinical trial in germany  evaluating repeat dosing with immu we also are commencing clinical trials with veltuzumab anti cd for the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases 
the clinical trials of veltuzumab and immu in patients with non hodgkin s lymphoma are nearing completion 
we are conducting clinical trials with milatuzumab in patients with multiple myeloma  and with immu for use in targeting anti muc antibody for pancreatic cancer therapy 
in addition to these four product candidates  we have several others in pre clinical development 
diagnostics we have transitioned our focus away from the development of diagnostic imaging products in order to accelerate the development of our therapeutic product candidates  although we continue to manufacture and commercialize leukoscan in territories where regulatory approvals have been granted 
as of june   research and development into diagnostic product candidates was no longer a material portion of our business 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights what we believe to be the critical accounting policies and judgments made in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we account for revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple arrangements eitf 
eitf addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
in applying the guidance  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables can only be considered as separate units of accounting if a the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  b there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items and c if the right of return exists  delivery of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
if these criteria are not met  the revenue elements must be considered a single unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 
we concluded that the ucb agreement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and are amortizing the million payment received over the expected obligation period  which was originally estimated to end in november payments received under contracts to fund certain research activities are recognized as revenue in the period in which the research activities are performed 
payments received in advance that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as revenue when the research projects are performed 
upfront nonrefundable fees associated with license and development agreements where the company has continuing involvement in the agreement are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the estimated service period 
if the estimated service period is subsequently modified  the period over which the upfront fee is recognized is modified accordingly on a prospective basis 
in january  ucb decided to stop further new patient enrollment into the sle clinical trials designed and initiated by us 
investigators were advised by ucb of this decision  and protocol amendments have been submitted to institutional review boards to seek approval to treat patients with sle who demonstrated clinical benefit in these trials 
at that time  ucb and its experts in the field of sle believed that the existing clinical trial protocols should be revised  including potential changes to patient enrollment criteria as such changes may result in more rapid patient enrollment 
in early march  based on continuing discussions and information provided by ucb during the third quarter of fiscal  we determined that ucb terminated the sle clinical trials designed and initiated by immunomedics 
ucb and their experts in the field of sle have decided to establish new protocols under which new clinical trials for the treatment of sle would be conducted 
the clinical trial data from the recently stopped trials collected to date are valuable and are being analyzed as support for the new clinical trials 
the protocols for the new sle clinical trials will need to be reviewed and approved by the regulatory authorities 
as a result of the ucb decision  we are no longer able to determine when these clinical trials will take place nor can it determine how these decisions will impact its obligation period under the terms of the agreement with ucb 
accordingly  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  we ceased amortizing to revenue the deferred revenue recorded with the receipt of the up front payments from ucb at the inception of the license agreement until such time as the obligation period is reasonably determinable 
we have been advised by ucb that it remains committed to developing epratuzumab for the treatment of sle 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of mutually agreed milestones  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievement is not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and ii there are no continuing performance obligations associated with the milestone payment 
to date  we have not recorded any revenue for milestone payments under the ucb agreement 
contract revenue from collaborative research agreements is recorded when earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
revenue from non refundable upfront license fees and certain guaranteed payments where we continue involvement through collaborative development are deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of continuing involvement 
we estimate the period of continuing involvement based on the best available evidential matter available to us at each reporting period 
if our estimated time frame for continuing involvement changes  this change in estimate could impact the amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
revenue is recognized for royalties based on license sales of our product cea scan in japan and in europe 
royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with the contractual terms when royalty from licenses can be reliably measured and collectablity is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales is recorded when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
allowances  if any  are established for uncollectible amounts  estimated product returns and discounts 
since allowances are recorded based on management s estimates  actual amounts may be different in the future 
foreign currency risks for subsidiaries outside of the united states that operate in a local currency environment  income and expense items are translated to united states dollars at the monthly average rates of exchange prevailing during the year  assets and liabilities are translated at the period end exchange rates  and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders equity and are included in the determination of comprehensive loss 
transaction gains and losses are included in the determination of net income 
stock based compensation prior to july   we granted stock options to our employees at an exercise price equal to the fair value of the underlying shares of common stock at the date of grant and accounted for these stock option grants in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
under apb opinion no 
 when stock options are issued with an exercise price equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized in the income statement 
however  for purposes of disclosure only  we estimate the fair value of stock options through the use of option pricing models 
in determining the values to use in our option pricing model  we make several subjective estimates about the characteristics of the underlying stock and the expected timing of option exercise 
change to these estimates can change the fair value disclosures in our financial statements 
our board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting of all outstanding stock options as of june   primarily to avoid stock based compensation charges upon the adoption of sfas r on july  this total additional compensation cost would have been approximately  the exercise price of all stock options was above market value of the common stock at the time of the accelerated vesting 
effective july   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation cost includes the fair value of awards originally accounted for under apb no 
that were not vested on july  and compensation cost for all share based compensation granted subsequent to july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of statement r 
due to the accelerated vesting prior to the adoption of sfas r noted above  the impact on the statement of operations for the year ended june  was not material 
the non vested share based compensation that is outstanding as of june  is  which is expected to be recognized over the next four fiscal years 
as a result of using the modified prospective transition method prior periods have not been restated 
impairment of assets immunomedics reviews its long lived assets for impairment  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based upon our judgment of the company s ability to recover the asset from the expected future undiscounted cash flows of the related operations 
actual future cash flows may be greater or less than estimated 
make whole interest derivative liability the holders of the senior convertible notes due may  or the notes  who convert their notes also received on the date of conversion a payment equal to the amount of accrued and unpaid interest  less interest actually previously paid or provided for  up to and including the maturity date of the notes  known as the make whole interest payment 
the make whole interest payment was considered a bifurcated derivative since the embedded call option can accelerate the settlement of the interest component of the debt cost at the holder s option 
changes in the fair value of the make whole interest payment were recorded in current period operations 
the fair value of this instrument was recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as derivative interest liability 
the initial value of the derivative interest liability associated with the make whole interest provision of  was recorded as additional debt discount and was either amortized to interest expense over the life of the notes or classified to paid in capital for the notes when they were converted into shares of common stock 
as of june  all of the notes have been converted into shares of common stock  with the make whole interest derivative liability reduced to zero 
the value of this derivative liability was based on various inputs and assumptions such as the price of our stock at each balance sheet date and volatility 
changes in these inputs and assumptions  particularly the price of our common stock  have impacted the value of this derivative liability at each of the balance sheet dates 
life insurance policies split dollar policy in september  the company entered into a split dollar life insurance arrangement with dr 
goldenberg and a trust controlled by his family the trust pursuant to which the company agreed to pay a significant portion of the premiums on a whole life insurance policy insuring dr 
goldenberg and owned by and benefiting the trust 
the company will be repaid the lesser of the cumulative premium payments it has made with respect to the policy or the cash surrender value of the policy upon dr 
goldenberg s death or the voluntary termination of the arrangement by dr 
goldenberg out of the policies existing surrender value at the time of repayment 
in accordance with eitf  accounting for collateral assignment split dollar life insurance  an employer should recognize a liability for any post employment benefit in accordance with apb opinion no 
associated with split dollar life insurance plans 
since the contractual terms of the arrangement provide that the company may not be reimbursed the premiums of the policy upon termination of employment  the company accrues a liability for a post employment benefit  which is based on a number of assumptions 
the measurement of the related benefit is based on a number of probability weighted assumptions 
the more significant of these assumptions are a the appropriate discount rate to use in computing the present value of the benefit  b the expected return on cash surrender values  c the estimated retirement date  and d the expected period of time after employment and prior to the death benefit 
actual results will likely differ from the assumptions used 
those differences  along with changes that may be made in the assumptions used from period to period  will impact the amounts reported in the financial statements 
the company recognizes an asset based on the amount that could be realized under the insurance contract as of the date of each balance sheet 
the amount the company could realize in the lesser of the premiums paid by the company or the cash surrender value of the policy 
other life insurances policies the company has various other life insurance policies on dr 
goldenberg  some of the policies are for the benefit of the company and some of the policies are for the benefit of dr 
goldenberg 
when the company is the beneficiary of the policy  and there are no other contractual arrangements between the company and dr 
goldenberg  the company recognizes the amount that could be realized under the insurance arrangement as an asset in the balance sheet 
when the company is the owner of the policy  but has contractually agreed to give dr 
goldenberg rights to the policy  the company records both an asset for the amount that could be realized under the insurance arrangement  and a corresponding liability that represents the value contractually benefiting dr 
goldenberg 
the company recorded immaterial adjustments during the fourth quarter to properly reflect the contractual insurance arrangements between the company and dr 
goldenberg 
results of operations the election to apply eitf was adopted retrospectively and therefore comparative prior periods have been adjusted to reflect related balances as if the standard had been followed as of the beginning of all periods presented 
all adjustments are reflected in management s discussion and analysis 
see note to our audited financial statements 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were  as compared to  in the fiscal year ended june   representing an increase of  or  primarily due to the impact of the recognition of a portion of the deferred revenue from the development  collaboration and license agreement dated may  with ucb  sa ucb agreement  as well as higher product sales 
product sales of  for the fiscal year were  higher  primarily due to higher sales in europe than in the prior year due to having the leukoscan product available for the entire fiscal year

total operating expenses for fiscal year were  as compared to  in fiscal year  representing a decrease of  or 
research and development expenses for fiscal year declined by  or  to  from  in fiscal year due primarily to the transfer of the sle clinical trials to ucb as part of the ucb agreement 
cost of goods sold for fiscal year increased by  to  from  in fiscal year  primarily due to higher sales of diagnostic kits and lower production yields in the manufacturing process of leukoscan in the fiscal year 
sales and marketing expenses for fiscal year were  as compared to  for fiscal year  representing a decrease of  the decline in marketing expenses was due to the continued de emphasis of the diagnostic product line 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal year decreased by  from  in fiscal year to  this decrease was primarily due to a charge of  for fees associated with the ucb agreement in the fiscal year and the reduction in fiscal of certain legal expenses of approximately  interest and other income for fiscal year increased by  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  primarily due to higher levels of investments the result of the cash received from the ucb agreement in may and sale of shares of common stock in may as well as higher interest rates 
interest expense decreased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year this decrease resulted primarily from the conversion of the senior convertible notes from the previous fiscal year and the conversion of the remaining notes in fiscal for fiscal years and  we recorded a tax benefit of  and  respectively  as a result of our sale of approximately  and  of new jersey state net operating losses  respectively 
for the fiscal year  we recorded a federal income tax provision of  and our foreign subsidiaries recorded a foreign tax provision of  there were no federal income tax or foreign tax provisions for the fiscal year 
the tax benefits for and fiscal years were also partially offset by new jersey state income tax provisions  and  respectively 
net loss allocable to common stockholders for fiscal year is  or per share  as compared to  or per share  in fiscal year fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were  as compared to  in the fiscal year ended june   representing an increase of  or  primarily due to the impact of the recognition of a portion of the deferred revenue from the development  collaboration and license agreement dated may  with ucb  sa ucb agreement  partially offset by lower product sales 
product sales were  lower in europe primarily due to a lack of saleable leukoscan product earlier in the year 
on january  approval was received from the european regulatory agency to market leukoscan for the revision to our manufacturing process 
license fee and other revenues for fiscal year increased to  from  for the same period in  primarily from the recognition of a portion of the deferred revenue earned under the ucb agreement 
total operating expenses for fiscal year were  as compared to  in fiscal year  representing a decrease of  or 
research and development expenses for fiscal year declined by  to  from  in fiscal year due to the transfer of the sle clinical trials over to ucb as part of the ucb agreement  reduced spending for outside toxicity testing associated with producing compounds to be used in clinical trials and a concerted effort to limit spending to conserve cash during the year 
cost of goods sold for fiscal year decreased by  to  from  in fiscal year  primarily due to lower sales of diagnostic kits 
sales and marketing expenses for fiscal year were  as compared to  for fiscal year  representing a decrease of  the decline in marketing expenses was due to de emphasis of the diagnostic product line 
general and administrative costs for fiscal year increased by  from  in fiscal year to  this increase was primarily due to a charge of  for fees associated with the ucb agreement 
interest and other income for fiscal year increased by  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  primarily due to higher interest rates and increased level of cash available for investment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year resulting from the ucb agreement 
interest expense increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year this increase resulted primarily from the  of senior convertible notes sold in april this increase included the amortization of a portion of the expenses associated with the debt issuance costs  the mark to market value adjustment of the debt discount  the change in the market value of the make whole derivative interest liability  and the make whole interest payment regarding the conversion of the notes into shares of common stock 
in september a patent infringement suit with cytogen  inc and cr bard was settled for an undisclosed amount without any admission of fault or liability 
in connection with the settlement  we settled legal fees associated with the suit with the attorneys representing the company in the case 
we recorded a litigation settlement gain in other income in the amount of  which includes the reversal of legal fees previously accrued for this patent suit 
the specific amount of the settlement  however  is undisclosed in accordance with the terms of the parties settlement agreement 
on august  at a special meeting of stockholders a majority of holders of our common stock approved an amendment to the certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized from million to million shares 
in addition  the shareholders voted to authorize shares of common stock for conversion if required  into common stock for the senior convertible notes and the warrants 
the notes and warrants were therefore no longer restricted as to conversion into shares of common stock 
the liability for the warrants was increased by  to reflect our common stock valuation 
this increase in the liability for the warrants was reflected in the statement of operations 
the warrants were reclassified to permanent equity during the first quarter for fiscal years and  we recorded a tax benefit of  and  respectively  as a result of our sale of approximately  and  of new jersey state net operating losses  respectively 
these tax benefits were partially offset by income tax provisions of  in for state tax purposes and  in for our european subsidiary 
net loss allocable to common stockholders for fiscal year is  or per share  as compared to  or per share  in fiscal year research and development expenses research and development expenses for our products in development were  for the fiscal year ended june    for the fiscal year ended june  and  for the fiscal year ended june  research and development expenses decreased by  in or as compared to research and development expenses decreased by  in or as compared to we do not track expenses on the basis of each individual compound under investigation or through clinical trials and therefore we do not provide a breakdown of such historical information in that format 
we evaluate projects under development from an operational perspective  including such factors as results of individual compounds from laboratory animal testing  patient results and enrollment statistics in clinical trials 
it is important to note that multiple product candidates are often tested simultaneously 
it is not possible to calculate each antibody s supply costs 
there are many different development processes and test methods that examine multiple products at the same time 
we have  historically  tracked our costs in the categories discussed below  specifically research costs and product development costs and by the types of costs outlined below 
our research costs consists of outside costs associated with animal studies and costs associated with research and testing of our product candidates prior to reaching the clinical stage 
such research costs primarily include personnel costs  facilities  including depreciation  lab supplies  funding of outside contracted research and license fees 
our product development costs consist of costs from preclinical development including manufacturing  conducting and administering clinical trials and patent expenses 
the following table sets forth a breakdown of our research and development expenses by those associated with research and those associated with product development for the periods indicated 
years ended june  in thousands research costs product development costs total research costs research costs in total decreased by  or for the year ended june  as compared to research costs in total decreased for the year ended june  by  or as compared to the changes in research costs primarily relate to the following lab supplies and chemical reagent costs were  in  an increase of  or over lab supplies and chemical reagent costs were  in  a decrease of  or over the increase in spending in was replenishment of supplies that were utilized during but not purchased due to cash flow considerations prior to the ucb agreement in may personnel costs in were  a decrease of  or as compared to personnel costs in were  a decrease of  or as compared to these declines resulted primarily from employee attrition and cost savings efforts during the year 
animal studies conducted by outside organizations in were  a decrease of  or from  as testing for toxicity studies for compounds in the preclinical stage were reduced based on the current status of product development 
product development costs product development costs for the year ended june  in total decreased by  or as compared to product development costs for the year ended june  in total decreased by  or as compared to the changes in product development costs primarily relate to the following clinical trial expenses in were  a decrease of  or over this decrease is primarily the result of the transfer of the phase iii clinical trials for sle to ucb  effective may   with ucb responsible for the investigator fee and all other expenses associated with these phase iii trials 
clinical trial expenses in were  an increase of  or over this increase is primarily the result of investigator expenses for enrollment at clinical sites  particularly for epratuzumab for the treatment of sle of approximately  personnel costs in were  a decrease of  or as compared to this decrease was primarily due to employee attrition during the year  partially as a result of the transfer of the phase iii clinical trials to ucb in may personnel costs in were  a decrease of  or as compared to this decrease was primarily due to employee attrition  a reduction in recruitment fees and other cost control efforts partially offset by salary increases 
patent expenses for were  an increase of  or over this increase was primarily due to increased professional fees incurred for patent filings and support in patent expenses for were  a decrease of  or over  due to efforts to reduce patent related expenses and a favorable settlement of professional fees incurred for support services 
lab supplies and chemical reagent costs were  in  a decrease of  or over lab supplies and chemical reagent costs were  in  a decrease of  or over the continuous reductions between years were a result of delayed production of clinical antibodies as part of cost control efforts in and lower demand of the clinical trials with the transfer of the phase iii clinical trials for sle in may facility costs in were  a decrease of  or from  due to lower maintenance and repairs expense 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more 
the length of time varies according to the type  complexity and the disease indication of the product candidate 
we estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following periods clinical phase estimated completion period phase i years phase ii years phase iii years the duration and cost of clinical trials through each of the clinical phases may vary significantly over the life of a particular project as a result of  among other things  the following factors the length of time required to recruit qualified patients for clinical trials the duration of patient follow up in light of trials results the number of clinical sites required for trials and the number of patients that ultimately participate liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of our equity securities  revenue earned under licensing agreements and  to a lesser degree  from sales of cea scan and leukoscan  research grants from various sources and investment income 
discussion of cash flows cash flows from operations 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended june  was million  compared to million provided by operations for the year ended june  the decrease of million is primarily due to the prior year s cash receipt of million as a result of the ucb agreement 
the current year s loss on operations of million was an improvement over the loss on operations of million in the fiscal year 
the current year s cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by the amortization of million of deferred revenue from the ucb agreement  which was partially offset by benefit from payment of million of interest expense with company common stock 
cash flows from investing 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended june  was million compared to net cash provided by of million for the year ended june  the decline in cash flow from investing was a result of the purchase of million of marketable securities in for excess cash that was not required for operations  whereas in the fiscal year the company required the proceeds of the sale of securities to fund operations prior to the completion of the ucb agreement 
cash flows from financing 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended june  was million compared to net cash provided of million for the year ended june  the increase for the current year was primarily due to net proceeds received from the sale of common stock of million 
there was no corresponding equity sale in the fiscal year 
in the fiscal year the company received million held in escrow from the sale of senior convertible notes in the fiscal year 
at june   we had working capital of  representing an increase of  from  at june  the increase in working capital is a result of the may common stock offering resulting in net proceeds of  partially offset by our net loss of  the decrease of current liabilities as of june  was primarily due to the reclassification to non current liabilities of  for deferred revenues relating to the recognition of revenue under the ucb agreement 
at june   there was no long term debt  as a result of the conversion of  net of discounts of senior convertible notes into shares of common stock during the fiscal year  and the reclassification of the remaining portion of the new jersey economic development authority to current liabilities on may  we sold  shares of common stock  resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
the shares were sold to institutional investors at a price of per share 
the shares of common stock were sold pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec 
on may  we entered into the ucb agreement providing ucb an exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture  market and sell epratuzumab for the treatment of all autoimmune disease indications 
under the terms of the ucb agreement  we retained the rights to develop epratuzumab in the field of oncology  and ucb has an option to acquire development and commercialization rights to epratuzumab with respect to cancer indications at anytime prior to the first commercial sales thereof 
under the terms of the ucb agreement  we received initial cash payments totaling million before fees 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities amounted to  at june   representing an increase of  from  at june  the increase was primarily attributable to the may common stock offering  offset by our net loss for the proceeds from the common stock offering will be used for research and development activities and funding of operating expenses 
we have sufficient funds to continue our operations and research and development programs for at least the next twelve months 
cash requirements in fiscal year are expected to be at a higher level than in fiscal year due to increased spending for research and development activities and clinical trials for the therapeutic product candidates 
however  research and development activities are expected to continue to expand over time and we do not believe we will have adequate cash to complete our research and development compounds in our development pipeline in line with our corporate strategy 
as a result  we will continue to require additional financial resources in order to continue our research and development programs  clinical trials of product candidates and regulatory filings 
we continue to evaluate various programs to raise additional capital and to seek additional revenues from the licensing of our proprietary technologies 
there can be no assurance that immunomedics will be able to raise the additional capital it will need on commercially acceptable terms if at all 
if the company were unable to raise capital on acceptable terms  its ability to continue its business would be materially and adversely affected 
at the present time  we are unable to determine whether any of these future activities will be successful and  if so  the terms and timing of any definitive agreements 
actual results could differ materially from our expectations as a result of a number of risks and uncertainties  including the risks described in item a risk factors  factors that may affect our business and results of operations  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our working capital and working capital requirements are affected by numerous factors and such factors may have a negative impact on our liquidity 
principal among these are the success of product commercialization and marketing products  the technological advantages and pricing of our products  the impact of the regulatory requirements applicable to us  and access to capital markets that can provide us with the resources when necessary to fund our strategic priorities 
contractual commitments our major contractual obligations relate to an operating lease for our facility  a loan from the new jersey economic development authority used to fund the expansion of our facility and employment contracts in effect for our chairman of the board  chief medical officer and chief scientific officer and the president chief executive officer 
we have identified and quantified the significant commitments in the following table for the fiscal years ending june payments due by period in thousands contractual obligation thereafter total operating lease njeda loan insurance premiums employment contracts total in november  we renewed our operating lease for our morris plains  new jersey facility for an additional term of years expiring in october at a base annual rate of  which included an additional  square feet 
the rent is fixed for the first five years and increases every five years thereafter 
in may  we obtained a loan for  at a variable interest rate through the new jersey economic development authority  repayable monthly in equal installments 
the split dollar life insurance policy with david m 
goldenberg requires insurance premium payments by the company through the fiscal year 
the employment contract with the david m 
goldenberg  our chief medical officer and chief scientific officer expired june  a new four year contract was entered into effective july  this contract also includes a minimum royalty agreement  a percentage of the consideration the company receives from licensing agreements  sales of intellectual properties and disposition of undeveloped assets  as disclosed in the employment agreement 
the amounts included above are only the minimum payments and do not include possible additional incentive compensation included in the employment contract 
on december   the board of directors entered into an employment contract with the president chief executive officer  which expires on december  recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this authoritative interpretation clarifies and standardizes the manner by which companies will be required to account for uncertain tax positions 
adoption of fin is required for fiscal years beginning after december  immunomedics will be required to adopt fin no later than the quarter beginning july  immunomedics does not expect that there will be a material impact on its consolidated financial results upon adoption 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force on eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities eitf 
eitf provides that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or provided for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized and that such amounts should be recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed  and provides guidance with respect to evaluation of the expectation of goods to be received or services to be provided 
the provisions of eitf will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
immunomedics will be required to adopt eitf no later than the quarter beginning july  the effects of applying the consensus of eitf are to be reported prospectively for new contracts entered into on or after the effective date 
while we are in the process of evaluating eitf as it relates to nonrefundable advance payments we make for goods or services received in future research and development activities  we do not believe the adoption of eitf will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our exposure to market risk of financial instruments contains forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of actual results may differ materially from those described due to a number of factors  including uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and conditions impacting our industry 
our holdings of financial instruments are comprised primarily of auction rate securities and agency bonds 
all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale 
we do not invest in portfolio equity securities or commodities or use financial derivatives for trading purposes 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
we manage these funds accordingly 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in rated fixed income securities while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate of return 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings also are exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
we typically invest in highly liquid debt instruments with fixed interest rates 
the table below presents the amounts and related weighted average interest rates by fiscal year of maturity for our investment portfolio in marketable securities as of june  expected maturity date total fair value in thousands fixed rate average interest rate we may be exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in regards to certain agreements with service providers relating to certain clinical trials that are in process 
depending on the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar  realized and unrealized currency fluctuations could be significant
