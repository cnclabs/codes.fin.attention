item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following section of this annual report on form k titled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains statements that are not statements of historical fact and are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance  or achievement to differ materially from anticipated results  performance  or achievement  expressed or implied in such forward looking statements 
these statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties 
we discuss many of these risks and uncertainties at the beginning of this annual report on form k and under item business and item a risk factors 
the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of anika therapeutics  inc and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
management overview anika therapeutics  inc anika  the company  we  us or our develops  manufactures and commercializes therapeutic products for tissue protection  healing and repair 
these products are based on hyaluronic acid ha  a naturally occurring  biocompatible polymer found throughout the body 
due to its unique biophysical and biochemical properties  ha plays an important role in a number of physiological functions such as the protection and lubrication of soft tissues and joints  the maintenance of the structural integrity of tissues  and the transport of molecules to and within cells 
our currently manufactured and marketed products consist of orthovisc  which is an ha product used in the treatment of some forms of osteoarthritis in humans  amvisc  amvisc plus  staarvisc ii  and shellgel  each an injectable ophthalmic viscoelastic ha product  and hyvisc  which is an ha product used in the treatment of equine osteoarthritis  and incert is an ha based anti adhesive for surgical applications currently marketed in three countries outside of the us in the us orthovisc is marketed by depuy mitek  inc  a subsidiary of johnson johnson  under the terms of a licensing  distribution  supply and marketing agreement 
outside the us  orthovisc has been approved for sale since and is marketed by distributors in approximately countries 
hyvisc is marketed in the us through boehringer ingelheim vetmedica  inc we developed and manufacture amvisc and amvisc plus for bausch lomb incorporated under a multiyear supply agreement 
products in development include elevess  an ha based dermal filler used for cosmetic tissue augmentation cta applications 
we received fda and ce marking approvals for the initial cta product in december and first quarter of  respectively 
we filed supplements with the fda and eu for an enhanced version of the cta product during the fourth quarter of osteoarthritis business our osteoarthritis business contributed to our product revenue reflecting an increase in sales of compared to we have marketed orthovisc  our product for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee  internationally since through various distribution agreements 
international sales of orthovisc contributed of product revenue for the year ended december  and decreased compared to the decrease was primarily due to reduced international sales resulting from a change in the turkish government s reimbursement policy for more than drugs  including orthovisc and its competing products 
our turkish partner is working to resolve this issue  and we cannot predict if or when sales in that market will resume 
we expect international sales to decline in compared to reflecting the impact of losing orthovisc sales in turkey 
orthovisc became available for sale in the us on march   and is marketed by depuy mitek  inc  a subsidiary of johnson johnson  under the terms of a ten year licensing  distribution  supply and marketing agreement the jnj agreement 
the jnj agreement was originally entered into with ortho biotech products  lp obp  also a johnson johnson company  and was assigned to depuy mitek in mid sales of orthovisc in the us contributed of our product revenue for the year ended december   or increased by compared to the considerable increase was due to initial overstocking of product by obp in such that no units were purchased by obp depuy mitek during the last nine months of  as well as increases in depuy mitek s underlying sales to end users in compared to for the year ended december   depuy mitek s sales to end users were higher than in the same period in sales of orthovisc to end users has grown slower than anticipated since as a result of a number of factors 
we believe that a primary contributing factor to this slower growth has been reimbursement and the lack of receiving assignment of a specific reimbursement code 
the healthcare common procedure coding system hcpcs is a comprehensive and standardized coding system that describes classifications of like products that are medical in nature by category for the purpose of efficient claims processing 
hcpcs codes are assigned by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms for treatment in a doctor s office setting 
as is typical for a newly introduced medical device  initial sales of orthovisc were made without an unique reimbursement code 
we did not receive a unique reimbursement code for orthovisc until we believe that using the miscellaneous reimbursement code from through negatively impacted end user sales of orthovisc 
depuy mitek took significant steps to assist in the reimbursement process in physicians offices  including increasing its specialty sales force in the field to support the sales representatives and provide hands on assistance to the physicians offices 
in december  the cms assigned a unique reimbursement code to our orthovisc product 
the new code for orthovisc  a q code  was effective starting on january  this move will simplify the current reimbursement process  and improve access to orthovisc 
the assignment of a reimbursement code removes a barrier to physician utilization of the product for medicare and medicaid patients 
we expect this change will have a significant positive impact on our us orthovisc sales in sales of hyvisc  our product for the treatment of equine osteoarthritis  contributed to product revenue for the year ended december  and decreased from we expect hyvisc sales to stay flat in we continue to look at other veterinary applications and opportunities to expand geographic territories 
ophthalmic business our ophthalmic business includes ha viscoelastic products used in ophthalmic surgery 
for the year ended december   sales of ophthalmic products contributed of our product revenue reflecting an increase in sales of ophthalmic products of compared to sales to bausch lomb accounted for of ophthalmic sales for and contributed of product revenue for the period 
our former distributor for coease  advanced medical optics amo  completed the acquisition of the surgical ophthalmology business of pfizer  inc  in september  which included a competing line of viscoelastic products for use in ocular surgery 
as a result  our agreement with amo expired according to its terms in june there have been no sales to amo since the second quarter of anti adhesion business incert is an ha based anti adhesive for surgical applications 
ce marking approval for commercial marketing and sale was received in the third quarter of we commenced incert sales during the second quarter of research and development elevess  our cosmetic dermatology product  is a dermal filler based on a family of chemically modified  cross linked forms of ha designed for longer duration in the body 
elevess is a therapy designed as a soft tissue filler for facial wrinkles  scar remediation and lip augmentation and is intended to supplant collagen based products and to compete with other ha based products currently on the market 
in october  we completed a pivotal us clinical trial to evaluate cta s effectiveness for correcting nasolabial folds 
the trial was conducted by dermatologists and plastic surgeons at centers throughout the us the six month primary endpoint results of this trial were submitted to the us food and drug administration fda in a pre market approval pma application in september we received fda approval for the pma in december in the first quarter of  we received ce mark approval to market elevess in the european union 
on june   the company entered into a license and development agreement and a supply agreement with galderma  for the exclusive worldwide development and commercialization of hyaluronic acid based cosmetic dermatology products 
under the agreements  we are responsible for the development and manufacturing of the cta products  and galderma is responsible for the commercialization  including distribution and marketing  of the cta products worldwide 
as part of the agreement  the company is working on implementing some product enhancements that address cosmetic issues and the shelf life of the product 
these enhancements are expected to increase the competitiveness of the product both in the european and the north american markets 
these product and process modifications require supplements to our pma and ce mark approvals 
since the modifications do not address safety or efficacy issues  we do not believe additional clinical trials will be required 
in late  we filed amendments with the fda and the european union regulators to seek approval for the enhanced version of elevess 
in january  we received regulatory approval for the enhanced product  elevess  in canada 
currently  galderma is planning on launching the enhanced version of the product in mid summary of critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we monitor our estimates on an on going basis for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for the year ended december  revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue from the sales of products we manufacture upon confirmation of regulatory compliance and shipment to the customer as long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred and risk of loss has passed  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
amounts billed or collected prior to recognition of revenue are classified as deferred revenue 
when determining whether risk of loss has transferred to customers on product sales or if the sales price is fixed or determinable we evaluate both the contractual terms and conditions of our distribution and supply agreements as well as our business practices 
product revenue also includes royalties 
royalty revenue is based on our distributor s sales and recognized in the same period our distributor records their sale of the product 
on june   the company entered into a license and development agreement and a supply agreement with galderma for the exclusive worldwide development and commercialization of hyaluronic acid based cosmetic dermatology products 
under the agreements  the company is responsible for the development and manufacturing of the cta products  and galderma is responsible for the commercialization  including distribution and marketing  of the cta products worldwide 
the agreements include an upfront payment  milestones upon achievement of predefined regulatory goals  funding of certain ongoing development activities  payments for supply of cta products  royalties on sales and sales threshold achievement payments for meeting certain net sales targets 
the company accounts for the agreements in accordance with the emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
under eitf  in order to account for an element as a separate unit of accounting  the element must have stand alone value and there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements 
based on the review of the agreements  the company believes that two separate units of accounting exist a combined license and development unit and a manufacturing and supply unit 
milestone payments related to achieving regulatory goals under the license and development unit are subject to certain refund clauses  which are expected to expire by june pursuant to this model  the company will recognize payments received under the license and development unit upon expiration of refund contingencies  over the period in which the company performs its obligations  which approximates the contractual term of ten years 
using the contingency adjusted performance model  the intial and subsequent milestone payments  once earned  are recognized as contract and license fee revenue 
payments from the manufacturing and supply unit will be recognized post commercialization as product is delivered 
the company entered into an exclusive worldwide development and commercialization agreement the orthoneutrogena agreement in july for our cta products with orthoneutrogena  a division of ortho mcneil pharmaceuticals  inc  an affiliate of johnson johnson 
on september   the company announced that it had mutually agreed with orthoneutrogena to terminate its development and commercialization agreement 
the company received a payment of  from orthoneutrogena including a  contract termination fee 
given that there were no continuing performance obligations with respect to the development and commercialization agreement or the related termination agreement  all amounts were recognized during the third quarter of  including approximately  of previously deferred revenue under the performance based model 
total contract revenue recognized during related to the agreements with orthoneutrogena was  in december  the company entered into a ten year licensing and supply agreement the jnj agreement with ortho biotech products  lp  a member of the johnson johnson family of companies  to market orthovisc in the us in mid  the agreement was assigned to depuy mitek  inc  a subsidiary of johnson johnson depuy mitek 
under the jnj agreement  depuy mitek performs sales  marketing and distribution functions and licensed the right to further develop and commercialize orthovisc as well as other new products for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis based on the company s viscosupplementation technology 
in support of the license  the jnj agreement provides that depuy mitek will fund post marketing clinical trials for new indications of orthovisc 
the company received an initial payment of  upon entering into the jnj agreement  a milestone payment of  in february  as a result of obtaining fda approval of orthovisc and a milestone payment of  in december for planned upgrades to our manufacturing operations 
we evaluated the terms of the jnj agreement and determined that the upfront fee and milestone payments did not meet the conditions to be recognized separately from the supply agreement  therefore  we have deferred non refundable payments received of  which we are recognizing ratably over the expected ten year term of the jnj agreement 
under the jnj agreement  we are the exclusive supplier of orthovisc to depuy mitek  inc the jnj agreement provides for additional sales based milestone payments to us contingent upon achieving specified sales targets  in addition to royalty and transfer fees 
the jnj agreement is subject to early termination in certain circumstances and is otherwise renewable by depuy mitek for consecutive five year terms 
reserve for obsolete excess inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review our inventories and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on certain factors that may impact the realizable value of our inventory including  but not limited to  technological changes  market demand  inventory cycle time  regulatory requirements and significant changes in our cost structure 
if ultimate usage varies significantly from expected usage or other factors arise that are significantly different than those anticipated by management  additional inventory write down or increases in obsolescence reserves may be required 
we generally produce finished goods based upon specific orders or in anticipation of specific orders 
as a result  we generally do not establish reserves against finished goods 
we evaluate the value of inventory on a quarterly basis and may  based on future changes in facts and circumstances  determine that a write down of inventory is required in future periods 
stock based compensation 
effective january   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  sfas r share based payment  which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee services 
under the provisions of sfas r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the calculated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant 
prior to january   the company accounted for share based compensation to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 apb accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
the company also followed the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
the company elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method as provided by sfas r and  accordingly  financial statement amounts for the prior periods presented in this annual report on form k have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of expensing share based compensation 
the company estimates the fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights using the black scholes valuation model 
key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the exercise price of the award  the expected option term  the expected volatility of the company s stock over the option s expected term  the risk free interest rate over the option s expected term  and the company s expected annual dividend yield 
the company uses historical data on exercise of stock options and other factors to estimate the expected term of share based awards 
the expected volatility assumption is based on the unadjusted historical volatility of the company s common stock 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on us treasury interest rates at the time of grants 
estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by persons who receive equity awards 
deferred tax assets 
we record a deferred tax asset or liability based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  as measured by the enacted tax rates assumed to be in effect when these differences reverse 
as of december   management determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized and  therefore  a valuation allowance has not been recorded

per diluted share compared to  or 
per diluted share for the same period last year 
the primary drivers for the decrease in net and operating income was  of contract revenue and termination fee recorded through the third quarter of  an increase in sfasr compensation expense of  as a result of adoption of sfas r on january   partially offset by increases in product margin and interest income compared to total revenue 
total revenue for the year ended december  decreased by  to  compared to  for primarily due to decrease in contract revenue in connection with the termination of the orthoneutrogena agreement partially offset by an increase in product revenue 
product revenue for increased by  to  primarily due to increased orthovisc revenue from depuy mitek from both our sales to depuy mitek and increased royalties from depuy mitek s sales 
the increase in us orthovisc sales was partially offset by a decrease in international orthovisc sales and hyvisc sales 
see below for further details 
product revenue by product line 
product revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  compared with  for the year ended december  year ended december  ophthalmic products orthovisc hyvisc incert ophthalmic products sales increased  or  to  the increase was primarily attributable to growth of sales to bausch lomb in compared to  partially offset by the loss of business from advanced medical optics  which contract was terminated in june our sales of orthovisc increased  or  to  in as compared with  in the increase in orthovisc sales for was primarily due to an increase in us orthovisc sales 
domestically  sales by depuy mitek showed good progress with their unit sales more than doubling in compared to this resulted in a significant increase in royalty revenue for anika 
in addition  we resumed shipping orthovisc to depuy mitek in january as they had brought their inventory levels back to their target levels 
we did not ship any units to them during the last nine months of due to the inventory overstocking that arose in total us sales of orthovisc were  or of product sales  in compared to  or of product sales  in international sales of orthovisc decreased to  from  or in compared to the same period last year 
the decrease in international sales was due to a reimbursement change in turkey 
in the third quarter of the government of turkey eliminated reimbursement for over drugs including orthovisc and its competing products 
no shipment was made to our turkish distributor during the last five months of the sales to turkey represented and of product sales in and  respectively 
we expect us orthovisc sales to increase in compared to  and international orthovisc sales to decrease in compared to sales of hyvisc decreased slightly in as compared to and represented and  respectively  of product sales 
sales of hyvisc are made to a single customer under an exclusive agreement which was extended in april to december  we expect hyvisc sales to be essentially flat in from licensing  milestone and contract revenue 
licensing  milestone and contract revenue for the year ended december  was  compared to  for licensing and milestone revenue includes the ratable recognition of the  in up front and milestone payments from ortho biotech 
these amounts are being recognized in income ratably over the ten year expected life of the agreement  or  per quarter

product gross profit 
product gross profit for the year ended december  was  or of product revenue  compared with  or of product revenue  for the year ended december  the improvement in product gross profit was due to increased royalties  favorable raw material prices  and lower than normal margins in product margin in was adversely affected by costs incurred from the voluntary ophthalmic product recall 
we expect product gross margin to improve slightly in compared to reflecting higher royalties  higher manufacturing volume  and implementation of cost and process improvements changes 
research and development 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  or  to  from  for the prior year 
research and development expenses include those costs associated with our in house and external research and development efforts for the development of cta product enhancements  next generation osteoarthritis products  the costs of clinical trials  manufacturing process improvements  and the preparation and processing of applications for regulatory approvals at all relevant stages of development 
the decrease in research and development expenses during was primarily attributable to reduced clinical trial expenses in compared to in  our clinical trial spending was for a modest cta study to refine technique of elevess 
in  research and development spending included a large us pivotal cta trial in support of our september pma application 
the decrease in size and effort of cta clinical trials was the primary driver for the reduction in research and development expenses in from we expect research and development expenses will increase in the future related to next generation orthovisc products  and other research and development programs in the pipeline 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased by  or  to  from  in the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to recording of  of stock based compensation expense 
the company expects that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in the future related to headcount increases  and infrastructure expansion 
with the signing of a lease in january for our new facility in bedford  massachusetts  general and administrative expenses will increase by more than  in assuming a may  rent commencement date 
operating expense related to the new facility will be mostly recorded in general and administrative expenses until manufacturing operations occupies the building in late interest income  net 
net interest income increased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  in the increase was primarily attributable to higher average available cash and invested balances during as well as increasing interest rates 
interest income in is expected to decrease as a result of lower expected available cash due to capital investments in the company s new facility project 
income taxes 
income tax provision was  and  for and  respectively 
the slightly lower effective tax rate in of was primarily a result of the impact of research and other credits and unfavorable state deferred tax assets rate change in our effective tax rate varied from the us federal statutory rate due  principally  to the impact of research and development and other credits  and non deductible compensation expenses related to sfas r 
a reconciliation of the us federal statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate for the periods ending december is as follows years ended december  computed expected tax expense state tax expense net of federal benefit state deferred tax assets rate change permanent items  including nondeductible expenses federal and state research and development  and other credits other federal rate difference change in valuation allowance related to income tax benefit tax benefit expense we have a pending irs audit related to our tax return

sales to advanced medical optics decreased to  from  or  in compared to  and contributed only of ophthalmic product revenue for versus in the decrease in sales to advanced medical optics was attributable to advanced medical optics acquisition of a competing line of viscoelastic products for use in ocular surgery 
our agreement with advanced medical optics expired according to its terms in june this decrease was partially offset by increased sales to bausch lomb and  to a lesser extent  to increased sales to each of our other ophthalmic customers 
our sales of orthovisc decreased  or  to  in as compared with  in the decrease in orthovisc sales for was primarily due to overstocking of inventory by jnj in this resulted in substantially lower purchases of orthovisc by jnj from the company in this domestic decrease was partially offset by continued robust international orthovisc sales 
us sales of orthovisc were  or of product sales  in compared to  or of product sales  in the impact of the decrease in unit sales was partially offset by a increase in royalty fees tied to end user sales  and increased international sales 
international sales of orthovisc increased to  from  or in compared to the same periods last year

product gross profit 
product gross profit for the year ended december  was  or of product revenue  compared with  or of product revenue  for the year ended december  the decrease in product gross margin was mainly due to three factors the cost impact of a mid year product recall totaling approximately  a lower margin product mix  and volume based inefficiencies in our manufacturing process 
research and development 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased by  or  to  from  for the prior year 
research and development expenses include those costs associated with our in house research and development efforts for the development of new medical applications for our ha based technology  the management and cost of clinical trials  and the preparation and processing of applications for regulatory approvals at all relevant stages of development 
the increase in research and development expenses during was primarily attributable to expenditures associated with the pivotal clinical trial for our cta product initiated in and completed in late  as well as engineering and scale up activities in preparation for the manufacture of our cta product 
the company filed a pma application with the fda based on the results of this clinical trial 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  or  to  from  in the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to lower business development expenses and professional fees related to the sarbanes oxley act  which were partially offset by higher fees related to recruiting 
interest income

income taxes 
income tax provision for is  versus a net tax benefit of  recorded for the net benefit was comprised of a provision for income taxes of  offset by a  benefit resulting from the release of the valuation allowance 
as a result of the receipt of the  in milestone payments in from ortho biotech  our recent operating results  and forecasted future income  together supported an assertion that ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets was more likely than not at december  accordingly  the company fully released the valuation allowance during and correspondingly recorded a one time tax benefit of  or 
per fully diluted share 
liquidity and capital resources we require cash to fund our operating expenses and to make capital expenditures 
we expect that our requirements for cash to fund these uses will increase as the scope of our operations expands 
historically we have funded our cash requirements from available cash and investments on hand 
we expect that our existing capital resources  together with cash from operations and interest income  will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  compared to  at december   and  at december  cash provided by operating activities was   and  for   and respectively 
cash provided by operating activities decreased by  in from this decrease in operating cash was primarily due to the following major factors a decrease in net income of  build up of inventory of  primarily related to the reimbursement policy change in turkey  and an increase in accounts receivables of  due to sales growth  which were partially offset by a net increase in current assets and liabilities of  cash used in investing activities was  and  in and respectively 
cash provided by investing activities was  in cash used for investing activities in and was primarily the result of deposits for manufacturing equipment and construction costs to build a new manufacturing suite in connection with our new cta product currently in development 
net cash flows from investing activities for includes the release of restricted cash of  which was partially offset by capital expenditures of  primarily for manufacturing and computer equipment 
we expect to increase our capital expenditures in primarily related to the buildout of our new facility 
we expect the new facility capital project to cost approximately million including interior construction  equipment  furniture and fixtures  of which approximately million will be spent or committed during this new facility will serve as our corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility for the foreseeable future 
we plan to use a combination of cash on hand and debt to finance the build out with up to approximately provided by long term debt 
there can be no assurance that we will find available financing or financing on terms favorable to the company 
construction is expected to commence in the spring of and continue into there can also be no assurance that we will be successful in re qualifying the new facility under the fda and european union regulations 
cash provided by financing activities of   and  for  and  respectively  reflects the proceeds from the exercise of stock options  including any associated tax benefits 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing techniques except for operating leases as disclosed in the contractual obligations table below that we believe have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources

this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the board having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for the company as of january  the company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting sfas on september   the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  or sab sab provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for the purposes of determining whether the current year s financial statements are materially misstated 
sab becomes effective for accounting years ending after november  the adoption of this sab did not have any impact on our financial statements 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments we have no material commitments for purchases of inventories 
we expect to incur significant capital investments related to the buildout of our new facility in bedford  massachusetts 
we plan to use a combination of cash on hand and debt to finance the build out with up to approximately provided by long term debt 
there can be no assurance that we will find available financing or financing on terms favorable to the company 
to the extent that funds generated from our operations  together with our existing capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements  we will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financings  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
no assurance can be given that any additional financing will be made available to us or will be available on acceptable terms should such a need arise 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend  on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our existing and future products  the success and sales of orthovisc under the jnj agreement  the successful commercialization of products in development  progress in our product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such efforts  progress with pre clinical studies  clinical trials and product clearances by the fda and other agencies  the cost of maintaining adequate manufacturing capabilities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  the development of strategic alliances for the marketing of certain of our products  the terms of such strategic alliances  including provisions and our ability to satisfy such provisions that provide upfront and or milestone payments to us  and the cost of maintaining adequate inventory levels to meet current and future product demands 
we cannot assure you that we will record profits in future periods 
however  we believe that based on our current strategy  our cash and investments on hand will be sufficient to meet our cash flows requirements beyond see item a 
risk factors
