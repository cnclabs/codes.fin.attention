the company assumed convertible debentures totaling approximately million in the wild oats acquisition  of which approximately million was paid off during fiscal year and approximately million  which included a related conversion premium totaling approximately million  was paid off subsequent to year end 
the remaining whole foods market debentures have an effective yield to maturity of and a scheduled maturity date of march  the debentures are convertible at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity  unless previously redeemed or otherwise purchased 
the debentures may be redeemed at the option of the holder on march  or march  at the issue price plus accrued original discount to the date of redemption 
subject to certain limitations  at our option  we may elect to pay this purchase price in cash  shares of common stock or any combination thereof

although the timing of any potential redemption is uncertain  the above table reflects the assumption that the remaining whole foods market convertible debentures  shown at accreted value as of september   will be redeemed at the option of the holder on march  we periodically make other commitments and become subject to other contractual obligations that we believe to be routine in nature and incidental to the operation of the business 
management believes that such routine commitments and contractual obligations do not have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations

the continuation of these payments  the amount of such dividends  and the form in which the dividends are paid cash or stock depend on many factors  including the results of operations and the financial condition of the company 
subject to these qualifications  the company currently expects to pay dividends on a quarterly basis 
on november   the company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to million over four years

the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice 
our principal historical sources of liquidity have been cash generated by operations  available unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and amounts available under our revolving line of credit 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that our revolving line of credit or other sources of capital will be available to us in the future 
we continually evaluate the need to establish other sources of working capital and will seek those considered appropriate based upon the company s needs and market conditions 
absent any significant cash acquisition or significant change in market condition  we expect planned expansion and other anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months will be funded by these sources 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual amounts may differ from these estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and resulting estimates to make adjustments we consider appropriate under the facts and circumstances 
we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position  and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
insurance and self insurance liabilities the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance plans to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation  general liability  property insurance  director and officers liability insurance  vehicle liability and employee health care benefits 
liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the company are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
reserves for closed properties the company maintains reserves for estimated losses on retail stores  distribution warehouses and other properties that are no longer being utilized in current operations 
the company provides for closed property operating lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining noncancelable lease payments after the closing date  net of estimated subtenant income 
the closed property lease liabilities usually are paid over the remaining lease terms  which generally range from one to years 
the company estimates subtenant income and future cash flows based on the company s experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located  the company s previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions 
capital lease properties that are closed are reduced to their estimated fair value 
reduction in the carrying values of property  equipment and leasehold improvements are recognized when expected net future cash flows are less than the assets carrying value 
the company estimates net future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located and  when necessary  utilizes local real estate brokers 
adjustments to closed property reserves primarily relate to changes in subtenant income or actual exit costs differing from original estimates 
adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known 
inventory valuation we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost was determined using the last in  first out lifo method for approximately and of inventories in fiscal years and  respectively 
under the lifo method  the cost assigned to items sold is based on the cost of the most recent items purchased 
as a result  the costs of the first items purchased remain in inventory and are used to value ending inventory 
the excess of estimated current costs over lifo carrying value  or lifo reserve  was approximately million and million at september  and september   respectively 
costs for remaining inventories are determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
cost was determined using the retail method and the item cost method for inventories in fiscal years and under the retail method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by counting each item in inventory  then applying a cost to retail ratio for various groupings of similar items to the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the retail inventory method calculations are certain management judgments and estimates which could impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
the item cost method involves counting each item in inventory  assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances of each item and recording the actual cost of items sold 
the item cost method of accounting enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the retail method of accounting 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill consists of the excess of cost of acquired enterprises over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  on a reporting unit level 
we allocate goodwill to one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing 
we determine fair value utilizing both a market value method and discounted projected future cash flows compared to our carrying value for the purpose of identifying impairment 
our annual impairment review requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates 
application of alternative assumptions and definitions  such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level  could produce significantly different results 
income taxes we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities by applying statutory tax rates in effect at the balance sheet date to differences between the book basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted to reflect changes in tax laws or rates in the period that includes the enactment date 
significant accounting judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals  deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
in addition  we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the irs and other state and local taxing authorities 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
share based payments the company maintains several share based incentive plans 
we historically granted options to purchase common stock under our stock option plans  as amended 
at our annual shareholder s meeting  on march   our shareholders approved a new plan  the whole foods market stock incentive plan 
options are granted pursuant to this new plan 
under both plans  options are granted at an option price equal to the market value of the stock at the grant date and are generally exercisable ratably over a four year period beginning one year from grant date and have a five year term 
the grant date is established once the company s board of directors approves the grant and all key terms have been determined 
the exercise prices of our stock option grants are the closing price on the grant date 
stock option grant terms and conditions are communicated to team members within a relatively short period of time 
our company generally approves one primary stock option grant annually  occurring during a trading window 
our company offers a team member stock purchase plan to all full time team members with a minimum of hours of service 
participating team members may purchase our common stock through payroll deductions 
at our annual meeting  shareholders approved a new team member stock purchase plan tmspp which became effective on april  the tmspp replaces all previous stock purchase plans and provides for a discount on the shares purchase date market value which meets the safe harbor provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment and therefore is non compensatory 
under the previous plans  participating team members could elect to purchase unrestricted shares at of market value or restricted shares at of market value on the purchase date 
prior to the effective date of revised sfas no 
r  the company applied accounting principles board opinion no 
apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations for our stock option grants 
apb no 
provides that the expense relative to our team member stock options is measured based on the intrinsic value of the stock option at date of grant 
effective the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year  the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  prior periods were not restated 
the company uses the black scholes multiple option pricing model which requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates  including estimates of the expected term team members will retain their vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term  and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements 
the related share based payments expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of share based payments and consequently  the related amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the provisions of sfas no 
r apply to new stock options and stock options outstanding  but not yet vested  on the effective date 
sfas no 
r requires the company to value unvested stock options granted prior to its adoption of sfas no 
under the fair value method and expense these amounts in the income statement over the stock option s remaining vesting period 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company accelerated the vesting of all outstanding stock options  except options held by the members of the executive team and certain options held by team members in the united kingdom  in order to prevent past option grants from having an impact on future results 
the company intends to keep its broad based stock option program in place  but also intends to limit the number of shares granted in any one year so that annual earnings per share dilution from share based payments expense will not exceed

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes and changes in market values of our investments and long term debt 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations on our foreign subsidiaries 
interest rate risk we seek to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations through ongoing evaluation of the composition of our investments and long term debt 
our line of credit borrowings do not give rise to significant fair value risk because these borrowings have revolving maturities 
at september   approximately million was outstanding under our line of credit agreement 
at september   the company held interest bearing instruments that were classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
these investments were of a short term nature  and therefore changes in interest rates would not likely have had a material impact on the valuation of these instruments or interest income 
we classified these investments as available for sale and  accordingly  recorded them at fair value on our balance sheet 
at september   these investments totaled approximately million and earned an average interest rate of approximately 
at september   an unrealized gain of approximately million related to these investments was included as a component of shareholders equity 
during fiscal year  the company entered into a million  five year term loan agreement to finance the acquisition of wild oats markets 
the loan bears interest at our option of the alternative base rate or the libor rate plus an applicable margin  as of september   based on the company s moody s and s p rating 
our term loans do not give rise to significant fair value risk because they are variable interest rate loans with revolving maturities which reflect market changes to interest rates 
subsequent to the end of fiscal year  the company entered into a three year interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million to fix the interest rate at  inclusive of the applicable margin and associated fees  to help manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
interest rate and market risk our zero coupon subordinated convertible debentures have fixed interest rates  and the fair value of these instruments is affected by both changes in the market price of our stock and changes in market interest rates 
during fiscal year and approximately million and million  respectively  of the carrying amount  of the debentures were converted  at the option of the holder  into company common stock 
the zero coupon subordinated convertible debentures have an effective yield to maturity of and had an outstanding balance of approximately million and million at september  and september   respectively 
at september  the interest rate and market risk associated with the convertible debentures is not material 
at september  the estimated fair value of the convertible debentures exceeded the carrying amount by approximately million 
should interest rates or the market value of our stock increase or decrease  the estimated fair value of the zero coupon subordinated debentures would decrease or increase accordingly 
market risk we regularly review the carrying value of our investments to identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that such declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other than temporary 
foreign currency risk the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
we own and operate seven natural and organic foods supermarkets in canada and six natural and organic foods supermarkets in the united kingdom 
sales made from the canadian and united kingdom stores are made in exchange for canadian dollars and great britain pounds  respectively 
we do not hedge against this risk because of the small amounts of funds at risk
