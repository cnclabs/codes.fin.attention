item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restatement of financial statements the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflects the restatements discussed below and in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in this annual report on form k  we are restating the consolidated balance sheet as of december   the consolidated statements of operations  consolidated statements of cash flows and consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity for the and fiscal years  and quarterly information unaudited for the first three quarters of and all of fiscal we have not amended our previously filed annual reports on form k for the periods affected by this restatement 
see item selected financial data and note restatement of financial statements of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information regarding the restatement and the changes to the previously issued financial statements 
the previously issued financial statements are being restated because we have determined that they contain errors in accounting for pension and postretirement liabilities 
the reporting errors arose principally from the treatment of pension and benefits plans established pursuant to collective bargaining agreements between the company and its subsidiaries  on the one hand  and the new york times newspaper guild  on the other  as multi employer plans 
the plans participants include employees of the new york times and a company subsidiary  as well as employees of the plans administrator 
we have concluded that  under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  the plans should have been accounted for as single employer plans 
the main effect of the change is that we must account for the present value of projected future benefits to be provided under the plans 
previously  we had recorded the expense of our annual contributions to the plans 
while the calculations will increase our reported expense  the accounting changes will not materially increase our funding obligations  which are regulated by our collective bargaining agreements with the union 
the restatement also reflects the effect of other unrecorded adjustments that were previously determined to be immaterial  mainly related to accounts receivable allowances and accrued expenses 
the annual and quarterly earnings per share eps impact of the restatement for the three year period ending december   is as follows quarter first second third fourth year basic and diluted eps as reported basic n a n a as restated basic n a n a as reported diluted n a n a as restated diluted n a n a basic and diluted eps as reported basic as restated basic as reported diluted as restated diluted basic and diluted eps as reported basic as restated basic as reported diluted as restated diluted the cumulative effect of the restatement resulted in a reduction in stockholder s equity of approximately million as of december  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

annual report executive overview broadcast media group on january   we entered into an agreement to sell our broadcast media group  consisting of nine network affiliated television stations  their related web sites and the digital operating center  for million 
the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first half of the results of the broadcast media group are reported as discontinued operations 
joint ventures the company s investments accounted for under the equity method are as follows a interest in metro boston llc  which publishes a free daily newspaper catering to young professionals and students in the greater boston area  a interest in a canadian newsprint company  donohue malbaie inc  a interest in a partnership  madison paper industries  operating a supercalendered paper mill in maine  and an approximately interest in new england sports ventures  which owns the boston red sox  fenway park and adjacent real estate  approximately of the new england sports network  a regional cable sports network  and of roush fenway racing  a leading nascar team 
business environment we operate in the highly competitive media industry 
we believe that a number of factors and industry trends have had  and will continue to have  a fundamental effect on our business and prospects 
these include increasing competition competition for advertising revenue that our businesses face affects our ability both to attract and retain advertisers and consumers and to maintain or increase our advertising rates 
we expect technological developments will continue to increase the number of media choices  intensifying the challenges posed by audience fragmentation 
we have expanded and will continue to expand our online and mobile offerings  however  most of our revenues are currently from traditional print products 
our print advertising revenues have declined 
we believe that this decline  particularly in classified advertising  is due to a shift to online media or to other forms of media and marketing 
economic conditions our advertising revenues  which account for approximately of our news media group revenues  are susceptible to economic swings 
national and local economic conditions  particularly in the new york city and boston metropolitan regions  affect the level of our national  classified and retail advertising revenue 
in addition  a significant portion of our advertising revenues comes from the studio entertainment  department store  and automotive sectors 
consolidation among key advertisers in these and other categories as well as changes in spending practices or priorities has depressed  and may continue to depress  our advertising revenue 
we believe that categories that have historically generated significant amounts of advertising revenues for our businesses are likely to continue to be challenged in these include studio entertainment  telecommunications  and help wanted and automotive classified advertising and  within the new england media group  department store advertising 
circulation circulation is another significant source of revenue for us 
in recent years  we  along with the newspaper industry as a whole  have experienced difficulty increasing circulation volume and revenues 
this is due to  among other factors  increased competition from new media formats and sources  and shifting preferences among some consumers to receive all or a portion of their news from sources other than a newspaper 
expenses our most significant expenses are for compensation related costs and raw materials  which account for approximately of total costs and expenses 
changes in the price of newsprint or in compensation related expenses can materially affect our operating results 
for a discussion of these and other factors that could affect our results of operations and financial conditions  see forward looking statements and item a risk factors 
our strategy we anticipate that these challenges will continue  and we believe that the following elements are key to our efforts to address them 
new products and services we are addressing the increasingly fragmented media landscape by building on the strength of our brands  particularly of the new york times 
to further leverage these brands  we have introduced and will continue to introduce a number of new products and services in print and online 
in  these included new specialty magazines in new york and boston  zoned and special sections across other properties  new ad placements  including section executive overview the new york times company p 
fronts at nearly all of our newspapers  and new weekly newspapers in our regional media group 
online  we redesigned nytimes 
com  increased editorial content at about 
com through increased guides  launched a local search product on boston 
com  and acquired baseline studiosystems  the primary business to business supplier of proprietary entertainment information to the film and television industries 
on february   we announced a strategic alliance with monster worldwide  inc to further build our online recruitment product offering 
we expect our revenues from internet related businesses  including about 
com  nytimes 
com  boston 
com  iht 
com and the sites associated with our regional newspapers  to grow approximately percent to approximately million in  mainly from organic growth 
leadership in content categories in addition to reinforcing our leadership in our individual properties  we seek to maintain and develop leadership in key content categories  such as entertainment  luxury real estate and travel  categories we believe appeal to our distinctive audience and will deepen their engagement with our products 
through the acquisition of about 
com  we gained leadership in a number of online verticals 
one of the top most visited web sites in  about 
com is the third largest commercial health channel and third largest food channel on the internet  according to nielsen netratings 
in september  we strengthened its health offerings by acquiring calorie count 
com  a site that offers weight loss tools and nutritional information 
innovation in  we implemented a research and development capability to better help us anticipate consumer preferences 
this initiative is closely linked to our operating units so that its work can have both near and long term business impact 
as a result of these efforts  in  we launched new mobile web sites in new york  boston and gainesville 
rebalanced portfolio we continuously evaluate our businesses to determine whether they are meeting their targets for financial performance  growth and return on investment and whether they remain relevant to our strategy 
as a result of this analysis  in october  we sold our investment in discovery times channel 
on january   we entered into an agreement to sell our broadcast media group to allow us to focus on developing our print and digital businesses 
in the first quarter of  we expect to complete the sale of one of our two radio stations 
at the same time  we have made selective acquisitions and investments  such as the acquisitions of baseline and calorie count 
com 
expense management managing expenses is a key component of our strategy 
we continuously review our expense structure to ensure that we are operating our businesses efficiently 
we focus on reducing costs by streamlining our operations  freeing up resources and achieving cost benefits from productivity gains 
in  our cost control efforts principally addressed employee related costs and newsprint expense  our main operating expenses 
we have implemented staff reductions  partially offset by increases from acquisitions and hiring in critical areas 
we continually monitor newsprint prices  which are subject to supply and demand market conditions  and have adopted a number of measures to reduce newsprint consumption 
as part of our efforts to reduce costs  in july  we announced plans to consolidate our new york metro area printing into our newer facility in college point  ny  and to close our older edison  ny  facility 
we also announced that we would reduce the size of all editions of the times  with the printed page decreasing from by inches to by inches 
we expect to complete the reduction in the third quarter of and the plant consolidation in the second quarter of with the plant consolidation  we expect to save million in lower operating costs annually and to avoid the need for approximately million in capital investment at the edison facility over the next years 
we expect to incur capital expenditures of million related to the plant consolidation 
as part of the plant consolidation  we expect a workforce reduction of approximately full time equivalent employees 
we have identified total costs to close the edison facility in the range of million to million  principally consisting of accelerated depreciation charges  as well as staff reduction charges and plant restoration costs 
we expect to exit the facility in the second quarter of and  depending on the disposition of the property  may recognize additional charges with respect to our lease  which continues through with the web width reduction  we expect to save more than million annually from decreased newsprint consumption 
we expect to incur capital expenditures of million related to the reduction

the new england media group  which includes the globe  boston

we have no liabilities subject to accelerated payment upon a ratings downgrade and do not expect the downgrades of our long term and short term debt ratings to have any material impact on our ability to borrow 
however  as a result of these downgrades  we may incur higher borrowing costs for any future long term and short term issuances 
we do not currently expect these to be significant 
commercial paper our liquidity requirements are primarily funded through the issuance of commercial paper 
in the third quarter of  we increased the amount available under our commercial paper program  which is supported by the revolving credit agreements described below  to million from million 
our commercial paper is unsecured and can have maturities of up to days 
we had million in commercial paper outstanding as of december  with a weighted average interest rate of per annum and an average of days to maturity from original issuance 
we had million in commercial paper outstanding as of december  with a weighted average interest rate of per annum and an average of days to maturity from original issuance 
revolving credit agreements the primary purpose of our million revolving credit agreements is to support our commercial paper program 
in addition  these revolving credit agreements provide a facility for the issuance of letters of credit 
in june  we replaced our million multi year credit agreement with a million credit agreement maturing in june of the total million available under the two revolving credit agreements million credit agreement maturing in may and million credit agreement maturing in june  we have issued letters of credit of approximately million 
the remaining balance of approximately million supports our c ommercial paper program discussed above 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit agreements as of december any borrowings under the revolving credit agreements bear interest at specified margins based on our credit rating  over various floating rates selected by us 
the revolving credit agreements contain a covenant that requires specified levels of stockholders equity as defined in the agreements 
the amount of stockholders equity in excess of the required levels was approximately million as of december the lenders under the revolving credit agreements have waived  effective december   any defaults that may have arisen under the agreements due to inclusion in previously issued financial statements of the reporting errors that led to the restatement described above and in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

includes estimated benefit payments  net of plan participant contributions  under our sponsored pension and postretirement plans 
the liabilities related to both plans are included in pension benefits obligation and postretirement benefits obligation in our consolidated balance sheets 
payments included in the table above have been estimated over a ten year period  therefore the amounts included in the later years column include payments for the period of while benefit payments under these plans are expected to continue beyond  we believe that an estimate beyond this period is unreasonable 
see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our pension and postretirement plans 
in addition to the pension and postretirement liabilities included in the table above  other liabilities other in our consolidated balance sheets include liabilities related to i deferred compensation  primarily consisting of our deferred executive compensation plan the dec plan  ii tax contingencies and iii various other liabilities 
these liabilities are not included in the table above primarily because the future payments are not determinable 
the dec plan enables certain eligible executives to elect to defer a portion of their compensation on a pre tax basis 
while the deferrals are initially for a period of a minimum of two years after which time taxable distributions must begin  the executive has the option to extend the deferral period 
therefore  the future payments under the dec plan are not determinable 
our tax contingency liability is related to various current and potential tax audit issues 
this liability is determin ed based on our estimate of whether additional taxes will be due in the future 
any additional taxes due will be determined only upon the completion of current and future tax audits  and the timing of such payments  which are not expected within one year  cannot be determined 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on other liabilities other 
we have a contract with a major paper supplier to purchase newsprint 
the contract requires us to purchase annually the lesser of a fixed number of tons or a percentage of our total newsprint requirement at market rate in an arms length transaction 
since the quantities of newsprint purchased annually under this contract are based on our total newsprint requirement  the amount of the related payments for these purchases are excluded from the table above

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make p 
annual report critical accounting policies estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented 
we continually evaluate the policies and estimates we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 
we believe our critical accounting policies include our accounting for long lived assets  retirement benefits  stock based compensation  income taxes  self insurance liabilities and accounts receivable allowances 
additional information about these policies can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
specific risks related to our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
long lived assets goodwill and other intangible assets not amortized are tested for impairment in accordance with fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  and all other long lived assets are tested for impairment in accordance with fas long lived assets in millions restated long lived assets   total assets   percentage of long lived assets to total assets the impairment analysis is considered critical to our segments because of the significance of long lived assets to our consolidated balance sheets 
we evaluate whether there has been an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets not amortized on an annual basis or if certain circumstances indicate that a possible impairment may exist 
all other long lived assets are tested for impairment if certain circumstances indicate that a possible impairment exists 
we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level as defined in fas this test is a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value  which is based on future cash flows  exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  the second step must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over the fair value of the goodwill 
in the fourth quarter of each year  we evaluate goodwill on a separate reporting unit basis to assess recoverability  and impairments  if any  are recognized in earnings 
intangible assets that are not amortized eg  mastheads and fcc licenses are tested for impairment at the asset level by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount 
if the fair value  which is based on future cash flows  exceeds the carrying amount  the asset is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value of the asset 
all other long lived assets intangible assets that are amortized  such as a subscriber list  and property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment at the asset level associated with the lowest level of cash flows 
an impairment exists if the carrying value of the asset is i not recoverable the carrying value of the asset is greater than the sum of undiscounted cash flows and ii is greater than its fair value 
the significant estimates and assumptions used by management in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets are estimated future cash flows  present value discount rate  as well as other factors 
any changes in these estimates or assumptions could result in an impairment charge 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgment 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluations of long lived assets can vary within a range of outcomes 
in addition to the testing above  which is done on an annual basis  management uses certain indicators to evaluate whether the carrying value of its long lived assets may not be recoverable  such as i current period operating or cash flow declines combined with a history of operating or cash flow declines or a projection forecast that demonstrates continuing declines in the cash flow of an entity or inability of an entity to improve its operations to forecasted levels and ii a significant adverse change in the business climate  whether structural or technological  that could affect the value of an entity 
management has applied what it believes to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of its reporting units

 employers accounting for pensions fas  fas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions fas  and fas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans fas 
we adopted fas as of december  fas requires an entity to recognize the funded status of its defined benefit plans measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation on the balance sheet and to recognize changes in the funded status  that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost  within other comprehensive income  net of income taxes 
as of december   our pension obligation was approximately million net of a pension asset of approximately million  including approximately million  representing the underfunded status of our qualified pension plans  and approximately million  representing the unfunded status of our non qualified pension plans 
of the total net pension obligation  approximately million is recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income  of which approximately million represents unrecognized actuarial losses and approximately million represents unrecognized prior service costs 
as of december   our postretirement obligation was approximately million  representing the unfunded status of our postretirement plans 
approximately million of income is recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income  of which approximately million represents unrecognized prior service credits  partially offset by approximately million of unrecognized actuarial losses 
the amounts recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized through pension or postretirement expense in future periods

pension postretirement liabilities in millions restated pension postretirement liabilities total liabilities   percentage of pension postretirement liabilities to total liabilities we consider accounting for retirement plans critical to all of our operating segments because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions  which include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets and mortality rates 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the pension and postretirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
our key retirement benefit assumptions are discussed in further detail under pension and postretirement benefits 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of fas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of fas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the appropriate vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates or different key assumptions were used  it could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

 accounting for income taxes fas 
under fas  income taxes are recognized for the following i amount of taxes payable for the current year and ii deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequence of events that have been recognized differently in the financial statements than for tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using statutory tax rates and are adjusted for tax rate changes 
fas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider accounting for income taxes critical to our operations because management is required to make significant subjective judgments in p 
annual report critical accounting policies developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowances that may be required against deferred tax assets 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which could require an extended period of time to resolve 
the completion of these audits could result in an increase to or a refund of amounts previously paid to the taxing jurisdictions 
we do not expect the completion of these audits to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
self insurance we self insure for workers compensation costs  certain employee medical and disability benefits  and automobile and general liability claims 
the recorded liabilities for self insured risks are primarily calculated using actuarial methods 
the liabilities include amounts for actual claims  claim growth and claims incurred but not yet reported 
actual experience  including claim frequency and severity as well as health care inflation  could result in different liabilities than the amounts currently recorded 
the recorded liabilities for self insured risks were approximately million as of december and million as of december accounts receivable allowances credit is extended to our advertisers and subscribers based upon an evaluation of the customers financial condition  and collateral is not required from such customers 
we use prior credit losses as a percentage of credit sales  the aging of accounts receivable and specific identification of potential losses to establish reserves for credit losses on accounts receivable 
in addition  we establish reserves for estimated rebates  rate adjustments and discounts based on historical experience 
accounts receivable allowances in millions restated accounts receivable allowances accounts receivable net accounts receivable gross total current assets   percentage of accounts receivable allowances to gross accounts receivable percentage of net accounts receivable to current assets we consider accounting for accounts receivable allowances critical to all of our operating segments because of the significance of accounts receivable to our current assets and operating cash flows 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required  which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
pension and postretirement benefits pension benefits we sponsor several pension plans  and make contributions to several others that are considered multi employer pension plans  in connection with collective bargaining agreements 
these plans cover substantially all employees 
our company sponsored plans include qualified funded plans as well as non qualified unfunded plans 
these plans provide participating employees with retirement benefits in accordance with benefit provision formulas detailed in each plan 
our non qualified plans provide retirement benefits only to certain highly compensated employees 
we also have a foreign based pension plan for certain iht employees the foreign plan 
the information for the foreign plan is combined with the information for us non qualified plans 
the benefit obligation of the foreign plan is immaterial to our total benefit obligation 
prior to the fourth quarter of  a pension plan between the company and its subsidiaries  on the one hand  and the new york times newspaper guild  on the other  was accounted for as a multi employer pension plan 
we have concluded that it should have been accounted for as a single employer pension plan and have restated prior periods to account for the plan under fas see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
pension expense is calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on assets for qualified plans and a discount rate 
our methodology in selecting these actuarial assumptions is discussed below 
long term rate of return on assets in determining the expected long term rate of return on assets  we evaluated input from our investment consultants  actuaries and investment management firms  including their review of asset class return expectations  as well as long term historical asset class returns 
projected returns by such consultants and economists are based on broad equity and bond indices 
additionally  we pension and postretirement benefits the new york times company p 
considered our historical year and year compounded returns  which have been in excess of our forward looking return expectations 
the expected long term rate of return determined on this basis was in we anticipate that our pension assets will generate long term returns on assets of at least 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of to with equity managers  with an expected long term rate of return on assets of  and to with fixed income real estate managers  with an expected long term rate of return on assets of 
our actual asset allocation as of december was in line with our expectations 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
we believe that is a reasonable expected long term rate of return on assets 
our plan assets had a rate of return of approximately for and for the three years ended december our determination of pension expense or income is based on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation of assets recognizes investment gains or losses over a three year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a three year period  the future value of assets will be affected as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
if we had decreased our expected long term rate of return on our plan assets by in  pension expense would have increased by approximately million in for our qualified pension plans 
our funding requirements would not have been materially affected 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our pension plans 
discount rate we select a discount rate utilizing a methodology that equates the plans projected benefit obligations to a present value calculated using the citigroup pension discount curve 
the methodology described above includes producing a cash flow of annual accrued benefits as defined under the projected unit cost method as provided by fas for active participants  service is projected to the end of the current measurement date and benefit earnings are projected to the date of termination 
the projected plan cash flow is discounted to the measurement date using the annual spot rates provided in the citigroup pension discount curve 
a single discount rate is then computed so that the present value of the benefit cash flow on a projected benefit obligation basis as described above equals the present value computed using the citigroup annual rates 
the discount rate determined on this basis increased to as of december from as of december if we had decreased the expected discount rate by in  pension expense would have increased by approximately million for our qualified pension plans and million for our non qualified pension plans 
our funding requirements would not have been materially affected 
we will continue to evaluate all of our actuarial assumptions  generally on an annual basis  including the expected long term rate of return on assets and discount rate  and will adjust as necessary 
actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates  the level of contributions we make and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans 
postretirement benefits we provide health and life insurance benefits to retired employees and their eligible dependents who are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements  if the employees meet specified age and service requirements 
our policy is to pay our portion of insurance premiums and claims from our assets 
in addition  we contribute to a postretirement plan under the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement 
prior to the fourth quarter of  a postretirement plan between the company and its subsidiaries  on the one hand  and the new york times newspaper guild  on the other  was accounted for as a multi employer plan 
we have concluded that it should have been accounted for as a single employer plan and have restated prior periods to account for this plan under fas see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
p 
annual report pension and postretirement benefits in accordance with fas  we accrue the costs of postretirement benefits during the employees active years of service 
the annual postretirement expense was calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions  including a health care cost trend rate and a discount rate 
the health care cost trend rate range used to calculate the postretirement expense decreased to to from to 
a increase decrease in the health care cost trend rates range would result in an increase of approximately million or a decrease of approximately million in our service and interest costs  respectively  two factors included in the calculation of postretirement expense 
a increase decrease in the health care cost trend rates would result in an increase of approximately million or a decrease of approximately million  in our accumulated benefit obligation as of december our discount rate assumption for postretirement benefits is consistent with that used in the calculation of pension benefits 
see pension benefits above for a di scussion about our discount rate assumption 
in february we announced amendments  such as the elimination of retiree medical benefits to new employees and the elimination of life insurance benefits to new retirees  to our postretirement benefit plans effective january  in addition  effective february  certain retirees at the new england media group were moved to a new benefits plan 
in connection with this change  the insurance premiums were reduced with benefits comparable to that of the previous benefits plan 
these changes will reduce our future obligations and expense under these plans
