item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis should be read together with the consolidated financial statements of national coal corp 
and the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results  financial condition and liquidity and cash flows of national coal corp 
for the fiscal years ended december   and except for historical information  the matters discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and are based upon judgments concerning various factors that are beyond our control 
we mine  process and sell high quality bituminous steam coal from mines located in east tennessee and southeastern kentucky 
we own the coal mineral rights to approximately  acres of land and lease the rights to approximately  additional acres 
we have expanded our operations considerably since commencing operations at a single surface mine in tennessee in july as of december   our active mining complexes included two underground mines  two surface mines  and two highwall mines 
in addition  we have four preparation plants  two active and two inactive  and four unit train loading facilities  three active and one inactive  served by the csx and norfolk southern ns railroads 
we hold permits that allow us to open or re open five new mines close to our current operations 
as of december   we controlled approximately million estimated recoverable tons of coal reserves 
during the year ended december   we generated total revenues of million  an ebitda a reconciliation of non gaap figures is presented in footnote of item selected financial data loss of million  and sold approximately  tons of coal 
our goals continue to include expansion and increasing mine production  as market conditions allow 
the majority of our revenues have come from the sale of coal we produce 
we have also sold coal that we purchase from third party coal producers  both on a contract and a case by case basis 
additionally  we charge third party coal producers a negotiated price per ton for coal loading services 
for  we expect our production to be be slightly lower than in due to business decisions to temporarily idle or delay the opening of certain mines  a preparation plant  and a load out facility 
we will resume and expand our production activities when economic conditions are favorable 
we plan to increase the purchase of coal from third party producers to fulfill contractual obligations as part of our business strategy in our revenues depend largely on the price at which we are able to sell our coal 
coal prices decreased between and decreases in coal prices are primarily due to the supply and demand balance of coal in the market both domestic and imported  as well as the price and availability of alternative fuels for electricity generation 
continued low prices could adversely affect our revenues and our ability to generate cash flows in the future 
as a result of supply having exceeded demand during  which resulted in the currently low coal price environment  we have idled certain operations 
our long term sales agreements generally require our customers to buy coal from us at prices averaging over per ton  subject to customary quality adjustment provisions 
three of our contracts  pursuant to which we sold of our coal in the twelve months ended december   and which expire in and  provide for adjustment of coal purchase prices based on market conditions 
one of the contracts expiring in  which represented of coal sales for the twelve months ended december   is not being renewed due to our inability to obtain a contract with an acceptable sales price 
we plan to capitalize on upswings in the pricing environment  if such market conditions emerge  by pursuing additional long term contracts when economically acceptable to us 
in the interim  any uncommitted coal produced will be sold on the spot market for an economically acceptable price 
we have expanded our production capacity significantly 
in tennessee  we made million of major improvements to our infrastructure through the purchase of a mile short line railroad and the modernization of a large preparation plant and rail load out facility 
in february  we purchased a short line railroad for approximately million which connects our owned reserves to the norfolk southern railroad at oneida  tennessee 
we spent an additional million to refurbish the line and make it operational 
we also acquired the baldwin preparation plant and rail load out facility in in return for the assumption of certain reclamation liabilities and spent million during to refurbish and modernize the baldwin preparation plant and rail load out facility 
these investments will provide the capability to efficiently process and transport our coal produced from our owned reserves to market 
in addition we spent million on developing new mining operations in tennessee during the capital expenditures on mines  processing  and transportation should help us lower our operating costs 
also  the expenditures made on our transportation infrastructure should help reduce delivery cost to our southeast us utility customers 
when economically advantageous  we intend to utilize our increased production capacity by increasing our production 
longer term  we plan to permit and develop additional production capability from our current reserve base 
our financial results from operations depends heavily upon the cost of producing coal 
our primary expenses are wages and benefits  repairs and maintenance expenditures  diesel fuel purchases  blasting supplies  coal transportation costs  cost of purchased coal  freight and handling costs and taxes incurred in selling coal 
we expect that our exploration costs in the next few years will be relatively significant but that our exploration costs will decline as a percentage of revenues 
because of rising fuel costs  our transportation costs have increased significantly 
given that the coal mining business is capital intensive  we expect our depreciation expenses to increase in and beyond as we increase our capital expenditures for mining and other equipment needed to expand our business 
for additional information regarding some of the risks and uncertainties that affect us and our industry  see risk factors 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to computing depreciation  depletion  amortization  accretion  the basis of reclamation and workers compensation liabilities  asset impairment  valuing non cash transactions  and recovery of receivables 
estimates are then based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  the corresponding accounts receivable and the methods of estimating depletion and reclamation expense of actual mining operations in relation to estimated total mineable tonnage on our properties 
revenue recognition 
under sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in the case of coal we mine and sell  we negotiate a specific sales contract with each customer  which includes a fixed price per ton  a delivery schedule  and terms for payment 
when applicable  freight costs billed to the customers as part of the contract price are included as coal sales with the offsetting expense included in cost of sales 
we recognize revenue from sales made pursuant to these contracts at the time the coal is loaded onto rail cars and trucks at our load out  mine  and processing plant facilities 
property  plant  equipment and mine development 
property and equipment are stated at cost 
maintenance and repairs that do not improve efficiency or extend economic life are expensed as incurred 
plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of assets which generally range from seven to thirty years for building and plant and one to five years for equipment 
on sale or retirement  asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any related gain or loss is reflected in income 
leasing is used for certain capital additions when considered cost effective relative to other capital sources 
all leases with an initial term greater than one year are accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas   accounting for leases 
these leases are classified as either capital or operating as appropriate 
leased equipment meeting the capital lease criteria of sfas is capitalized and the present value of the related minimum lease payments is recorded as a liability 
amortization of capitalized leased assets is computed on the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the initial lease term 
reserves and mine development costs are recorded at cost or at fair value in the case of acquired businesses 
our coal reserves are controlled either through direct ownership or through leasing arrangements which generally last until the recoverable reserves are depleted 
depletion of reserves and amortization of mine development costs is computed using the units of production method over the estimated recoverable tons 
costs related to locating coal deposits and determining the extractive feasibility of such deposits are expensed as incurred 
exclusive of the approximately million of property  plant  equipment and mine development  net we had as of december  is approximately million of mining equipment classified as assets held for sale 
this equipment was sold in january for a small gain 
we review our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if impairment indicators are present and the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets  the carrying values are reduced to the estimated fair value 
asset retirement obligation 
the surface mining control and reclamation act of and similar state statutes require that mine properties be restored in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan 
significant reclamation activities include reclaiming refuse and slurry ponds  reclaiming the pit and support acreage at surface mines  and sealing portals at underground mines 
reclamation activities that are performed outside of the normal mining process are accounted for as asset retirement obligations in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
we record our reclamation obligations on a mine by mine basis based upon current permit requirements and estimated reclamation obligations for such mines as determined by engineering estimates 
in accordance with sfas  we determine the fair value of our asset retirement obligations using a discounted cash flow methodology based on a discount rate related to the rates of us treasury bonds with maturities similar to the expected life of a mine  adjusted for our credit standing 
in estimating future cash flows  we consider third party profit and apply inflation factors as required by sfas on at least an annual basis  we review our entire reclamation liability and make necessary adjustments for permit changes granted by state authorities  additional costs resulting from accelerated mine closures  and revisions to cost estimates and productivity assumptions  to reflect current experience 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation using statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
we currently use a standard option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
sfas r requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments  including employee stock options  at fair value and is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after december  we adopted this standard effective january  and have elected the modified prospective application transition method 
under the modified prospective application transition method  awards that are granted  modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the date of adoption should be measured and accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
awards granted prior to the effective date should continue to be accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sfas r with the exception that compensation expense related to unvested options must be recognized in the income statement based on the fair value of the options on the date of grant 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
mineral reserves 
we amortize our acquisition costs  development costs  capitalized asset retirement costs and some plant and equipment using the units of production method and estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves 
we review these estimates on a regular basis and adjust them to reflect our current mining plans 
the rate at which we record depletion also depends on the estimates of our reserves 
if the estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves decline  the rate at which we record depletion increases 
such a decline in reserves may result from geological conditions  coal quality  effects of governmental  environmental and tax regulations  and assumptions about future prices and future operating costs 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  which clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
a conditional asset retirement obligation is defined as a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
fin is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  our adoption of fin did not result in a change to current practice 
at its march  meeting  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf in issue no 
 accounting for stripping costs incurred during production in the mining industry 
issue no 
requires that the costs of removing overburden and waste materials to access mineral deposits during the production phase of a mine  commonly referred to as stripping costs  be included in the costs of the inventory produced 
eitf issue no 
is effective for the first fiscal period in fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we have adopted the eitf effective january  adoption of this eitf has had no material impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
 which changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of change 
when it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects of an accounting change on one or more individual prior periods presented  this statement requires that the new accounting principle be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and that a corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that period rather than being reported in the income statement 
management believes this statement will have no impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently assessing the potential impact of the interpretation on our financial position and results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within that fiscal year 
we are still analyzing sfas to determine the impact of adoption 
results of operations the following table presents consolidated statement of operations data for each of the periods indicated as a percentage of revenues

for the twelve months ended december   our revenues were derived from coal sales to fifteen customers  eight of which were utilities  six of which were industrial customers and one of which was a coal reseller 
our five largest customers represent of our total coal sales 
the increase in coal sales during the year ended december  is primarily attributable to a increase in sales volume and the addition of a new customer partially offset by a decrease in average net sales prices  including penalties and premiums 
in  coal prices in central appalachia remained relatively unchanged despite unseasonable weather in the southeast  however  a second year of cooler summer temperatures and warmer winter temperatures in did have a large negative impact on coal prices 
also  many producers increased production to meet the higher demand 
the increase in other revenues is due to the increase in receipts of loading fees of  from a coal company with property located adjacent to ours and approximately  of wheelage revenue under a lease agreement  offset by a prior year negotiated termination of a sales contract of  operating expenses caption twelve months percent ended december change 
del cost of sales   general and administrative expenses   depreciation  depletion  accretion and amortization expense total operating expenses   del 
cost of sales cost of sales consists primarily of salary  benefits  and other compensation costs paid directly to miners  and direct costs paid to third party vendors whose goods and services were directly used in the process of producing coal inventory 
third party vendor costs include equipment leases and maintenance costs  blasting costs  fuel costs  parts and supplies  coal purchases  and transportation costs 
the increase in cost of sales in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is primarily due to a increase in mined and purchased coal 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenue increased from in to in this was primarily due to inefficiencies incurred during the early stages of opening three new mines and building significant inventories  operating the refurbished baldwin wash plant with insufficient volume to absorb fixed costs  and the start up of our short line railroad 
operating costs associated with these projects for the year totaled million 
a significant portion of the cost increase  about million was associated with the three capital projects that were completed  but then idled 
those projects were mine  the baldwin preparation facility  and the shortline railroad 
in addition to the above  three other events contributed to higher costs during the year lost production from a highwall miner due to an accident in march  higher costs associated with purchasing and processing coal from third parties  and a significant increase in our cost structure in kentucky due to the termination of a subcontractor 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses primarily include non operations salary  benefits and related expenses  consulting expenses  legal and professional fees  insurance expenses  and travel and travel related expenses 
the change in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to changes in three major components  increase in stock option expense primarily due to our adoption of sfas r and an accelerated vesting of executive stock options for the former ceo  the former general counsel and secretary who is also the spouse of the former ceo  and the former coo   increase in professional fees  primarily legal fees  and  increase in payroll  primarily due to an increase in corporate personnel in as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses have decreased from in to in depreciation  depletion  accretion and amortization expense the increase in depreciation  depletion  accretion and amortization expense in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  is primarily attributable to a increase in depreciation 
this change was due to the acquisition of million of fixed assets  primarily mining equipment  net of fixed asset disposals with a gross value of approximately million and a change in the estimated useful lives of certain mining equipment at april  had this revision been made as of january   the effect would have been to increase depreciation expense by approximately million for the year ended december  other income expense caption twelve months percent ended december change 
del interest expense and financing fees   interest income   other income expense  net   total other income expense   del 
the increase in interest expense for the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  is attributable to an increase in the average outstanding balance of our debt related primarily to the issuance of million of senior secured notes obtained immediately prior to year end  partially offset by a decrease in financing fees of approximately million related to our prior year bond offering and a decrease in our weighted average interest rate of approximately 
interest income increased by primarily due to larger average short term deposit balances other income expense  net of  expense consists primarily of the write off of acquisition costs and a rebate from a third party railroad agreement in the current year versus a  expense in the prior year related primarily to a loss on the early extinguishment of notes payable 
comparison of twelve months ended december  and december  revenues twelve months percent ended december change coal sales   other revenue   total revenues   for the twelve months ended december   our revenues were derived from coal sales to fifteen customers  eight of which were utilities  six of which were industrial customers and one of which was a coal reseller 
our five largest customers represent of our revenue 
for the twelve months ended december   we had a total of twelve customers  two of which were utilities that accounted for approximately of our revenue 
the increase in coal sales during the year ended december  is primarily attributable to a increase in production volume  the addition of three new customers and a increase in average sales prices 
the significant increase in production volume over is primarily the result of experiencing four full quarters of operations in as compared to a single quarter in along with the closure of two lower volume mines and commencement of operations at two higher volume mines  one of which was a highwall mine 
during the two year period ended december   the market for central appalachian coal experienced an increase in demand and strong pricing 
during the year ended december   of our sales were below per ton  were between and per ton and was sold above per ton 
all sales under contract during were made at an average price above per ton 
all average prices include premiums and penalties for coal quality variances from contractual requirements 
the increase in other revenue is due to the receipt of tippling fees of  from a coal company with property located adjacent to ours and a negotiated termination of a sales contract of  at december   the sales contract had thirteen months remaining and required the delivery of  tons of coal through these increases were offset by the elimination of  in royalty revenue during operating expenses caption twelve months percent ended december change

third party vendor costs include equipment leases and maintenance costs  blasting costs  fuel costs  parts and supplies  coal purchases  and transportation costs 
the increase in cost of sales in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is primarily due to a increase in mined and purchased coal 
as the production of coal tons increases the cost per ton is decreasing 
our cost of sales as a percentage of total revenue has improved from in to in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses primarily include non operations salary  benefits and related expenses  consulting expenses  legal and professional fees  insurance expenses  and travel and travel related expenses 
the change in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to changes in six major components  increase in payroll  primarily due to an increase in corporate personnel in and incurring a full year of expense on eleven corporate employees hired in   increase in professional fees  primarily legal fees   increase in security costs related to securing our mine sites and corporate offices against various threats  the addition of  in directors fees due to the addition of independent directors   forfeited deposit on a real estate transaction  and a  increase in consultants  primarily financial consultants 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses have decreased from in to in depreciation  depletion  accretion and amortization expense the increase in depreciation  depletion  accretion and amortization expense in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  is primarily attributable to a increase in depreciation 
this change was due to the acquisition of million of fixed assets  primarily mining equipment  and a change in the estimated useful lives of our mining equipment 
on april   we changed our policy for the depreciable life of mining equipment to three to five years from seven years 
subsequently  most of our equipment was estimated to have a three year useful life 
this had the impact of increasing depreciation on mining equipment by approximately million during this adjustment was treated as a change in accounting estimate and depreciation expense was adjusted on a prospective basis

the increase in other income expense  net  in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense of  and an increase in other expense of  the increase in interest expense is due to added borrowings for asset acquisitions made during calendar of approximately million offset by the million interest expense recognized in as a result of the beneficial conversion feature of million of preferred shares issued in august the added borrowings do not include the  senior secured notes due  which were issued on december  related transactions see certain relationships and related transactions included elsewhere in this report for a full description of transactions to which we were or will be a party  in which the transaction involved exceeds a material amount  and in which any director  executive officer  shareholder of more than of our common stock or any member of their immediate family had or will have a direct or indirect material interest 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  negative working capital of approximately million  and cash flows used in operations of approximately million for the year then ended 
in order to fund general operating and working capital needs  we entered into a term loan credit facility in october that provides borrowings of up to million with guggenheim corporate funding  llc 
we borrowed million at closing  an additional million in december  and the the remaining million subsequent to year end 
as noted previously  we have made significant investments over the past three years to expand our production capacity significantly 
we are now in a position to increase our production when doing so will be economically advantageous 
we have no material capital projects planned for and our budgeted capital expenditures for the year are less than million 
at december   we had a shareholders deficit of million and incurred net losses of million excluding preferred stock dividends for the year then ended 
we expect that we will continue to incur net losses into the foreseeable future which will increase our shareholders deficit 
on march  we sold million shares of our common stock in a private sale 
two institutional investors purchased million shares and our current ceo purchased the remaining  shares 
proceeds from the sale were approximately million and will be used for potential internal and external growth opportunities and to fund general operating and working capital needs 
we are required to file a registration statement to register the shares as early as practicable  but no later than april  we expect to be able to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future through current cash reserves and cash provided by operations 
if our operating plans for vary significantly from our expectations  we may have to seek additional financing sources 
in the case that market conditions improve and we determine that it is economically advantageous to resume expansion plans  we may have to seek additional financing sources 
there are no assurances that our efforts to raise additional financial resources will be successful

we borrowed an additional million in january to fund our acquisition of mining equipment 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at the prime rate  plus 
the obligation under the credit agreement was secured by substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries 
at december   we repaid and terminated this credit facility resulting in the write off of approximately  of deferred financing costs 
cash flows we currently satisfy our working capital requirements primarily through cash flows generated from operations and sales of debt and equity securities

cash flows from operating  financing and investing activities for the twelve months ended december    and are summarized in the following table activity twelve months ended december  operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    net increase decrease in cash   operating activities the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities of approximately million to million used in operating activities during the year ended december  was primarily the result of an increase in net loss  net of depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion and non cash stock option expense  of million 
the increase was primarily due to lower contract prices  increased purchases of coal due in part to the highwall miner damage during the year  and the termination of a financially favorable agreement with a subcontractor for the management of our kentucky properties  partially offset by increased non cash stock option expenses of million over prior year due to the adoption of sfas r and the accelerated vesting of certain executive options 
offsetting the overall decrease in cash flow from operations is a greater increase in accounts payable of million primarily attributable to the refurbishment of our baldwin preparation plant and load out facility which has taken place in and increased interest due to higher debt balances 
these and other expansion activities have also resulted in a greater increase in inventory of million in current year and million of asset retirement obligation settlements  both of which decreased cash from operations 
the net cash provided by operating activities of approximately million during the twelve months ended december  was primarily the result of an improving net loss 
when the impact of depreciation is removed from the net loss  there is an improvement of million 
the reduction of net loss is due to a significant increase in coal sales and resulting improvements in the percentage of cost of sales and general and administrative expenses 
although many operating costs are variable  gross margin percentage improves as volume increases due to the fixed mine operating costs 
additionally  general and administrative costs are not variable and growth in those costs is slowing significantly relative to the increase in coal volumes as the securing of the management team and related corporate costs is completed 
the net cash used in operating activities of approximately million during the twelve months ended december  was primarily the result of the net loss of approximately million and an increase in receivables of approximately million  inventory of approximately  deferred revenue of approximately  payments for reclamation obligations of approximately  and prepaid and other of approximately  as we increased coal production during the year  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of approximately million and non cash expenses of approximately million 
the non cash expenses recorded during the period included  of interest expense related to the beneficial conversion feature of the million convertible debentures issued in august   of non cash compensation expense related to the issuance of stock options with an exercise price below the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant   of non cash compensation expense for the issuance of common stock in consideration of salary   of non cash interest expense for the issuance of common stock in lieu of interest payments  and  of non cash consulting expense for the black scholes pricing model valuation of warrants issued as consideration for consulting services rendered

the capital expenditures were used to open two new mines  including a highwall mine  and to acquire additional equipment for existing mines 
the approximately million of cash used in investing activities during the twelve months ended december  was due primarily to the purchase of approximately million of property  plant and equipment  million for the purchase of coal and mineral assets  million deposited with a bank as collateral for osm reclamation requirements   in deposits for a potential purchase of mining rights  and  of prepaid royalty in advance of royalties to be paid on property we lease and expect to mine within a few years 
financing activities the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities of approximately million to approximately million during the twelve months ended december  was primarily the result of the senior notes issued in december which decreased the need for additional funding

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risks our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the us at december   we had million aggregate principal amount of debt under fixed rate instruments and million of debt under variable rate instruments  with our term loan credit facility making up of the variable rate instruments and equipment financing making the remaining 
at december   we had million aggregate principal amount of debt under fixed rate instruments and million of debt under variable rate instruments  with equipment financing making up of the variable rate instruments 
under the terms of our term loan credit facility and our equipment financing agreements  the interest rate on borrowings there under was determined based on the eurodollar rate and the prime rate  respectively 
we are able to lock in the existing interest rate on our term loan credit facility for periods of up to six months 
based on the variable rate debt outstanding as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately  based on the variable rate debt outstanding as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately  commodity risks we are subject to commodity price risk based on the fluctuating market price of coal 
we manage this risk through securing long term coal supply agreements rather than through use of derivative instruments 
in the future  as existing long term contracts expire or become subject to repricing  our coal sales will be made at then current market prices 
as a result  our revenues and net income will be significantly affected by fluctuations in the price of coal 
coal prices are influenced by a number of factors and vary dramatically by region 
the two principal components of the delivered price of coal are the price of coal at the mine  which is influenced by coal quality  and the cost of transporting coal from the mine to the point of use 
electricity generators purchase coal on the basis of its delivered cost per million btu 
the price of coal is generally in parity with oil and natural gas prices 
as macroeconomic factors affect these commodity prices  the price of coal will similarly be impacted 
the cost of operating a mine is influenced by geological characteristics such as seam thickness  overburden ratios and depth of underground reserves 
it is generally cheaper to mine coal seams that are thick and located close to the surface than to mine thin underground seams 
typically  coal mining operations will begin at the part of the coal seam that is easiest and most economical to mine 
in the coal industry  this surface mining characteristic is referred to as low ratio 
as the seam is mined  it becomes more difficult and expensive to mine because the seam either becomes thinner or extends more deeply into the earth  requiring removal of more overburden 
underground mining is generally more expensive than surface mining as a result of high capital costs including costs for modern mining equipment and construction of extensive ventilation systems and higher labor costs  including costs for labor benefits and health care 
in addition to the cost of mine operations  the price of coal at the mine is also a function of quality characteristics such as heat value and sulfur  ash and moisture content 
coal used for domestic consumption is generally sold free on board at a loading point  and the purchaser normally pays the transportation costs 
export coal is usually sold at an export terminal  and the seller is responsible for shipment to the export coal loading facility while the purchaser pays the ocean freight 
most electric power generators arrange long term shipping contracts with rail or barge companies to assure stable delivery costs 
transportation cost can be a large component of the purchaser s cost 
although the customer pays the freight  transportation cost is still important to coal mining companies because the customer may choose a supplier largely based on the cost of transportation 
trucks and overland conveyors haul coal over shorter distances  while lake carriers and ocean vessels move coal to export markets 
some domestic coal is shipped over the great lakes 
railroads move more coal than any other product  and in  coal accounted for of total us rail freight revenue and more than of total freight tonnage 
railroads typically handle approximately of us coal production  with csx and norfolk southern the dominant carriers in the eastern united states 
some products used in mining activities  such as diesel fuel  are subject to price volatility 
we use short term fuel contracts to manage the volatility related to this exposure 
foreign currency all of our transactions are denominated in us dollars  and as a result  we do not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risk
