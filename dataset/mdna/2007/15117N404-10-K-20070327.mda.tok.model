table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview celsion is a biotechnology company dedicated to furthering the development and commercialization of oncology drugs including tumor targeting treatments using focused heat energy in combination with heat activated drug delivery 
in  we obtained premarketing approval pma from the fda to use our microwave based microfocus heat therapy system on surface and subsurface tumors in conjunction with radiation therapy 
we marketed this system until from until early in we engaged in research and development of new treatment systems 
on february   we obtained a pma for our prolieve thermodilatation system for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia bph and thereafter our marketing partner  boston scientific  commenced commercial sales of the prolieve system 
in addition  we are engaged in the development of treatment systems using a combination of heat and thermodox tm  our proprietary heat activated liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin  for the treatment of liver cancer and breast cancer 
development pipeline our pipeline presently consists of the following products  in the indicated stages of development product status prolieve thermodilatation system for the treatment of bph we received premarketing approval pma for the prolieve system from the fda on february  since that time  we have been commercializing the prolieve system through boston scientific 
boston scientific has an option to purchase the prolieve assets and technology for million which expires in february thermodox doxorubicin encapsulated thermo liposome plus heat for the treatment of cancer we are conducting a phase i clinical trial in collaboration with the national institutes of health and queen mary s hospital in hong kong using thermodox in conjunction with radio frequency ablation rfa in the treatment of liver cancer 
the company is also conducting a phase i study at the cleveland clinic and north shore long island jewish health system to test pre treatment regimens performed in the thermodox rfa study  as well as the company s single vial formulation of thermodox and multiple dosing of liver cancer patients 
cc 
we are also sponsoring the conduct of an investigator initiated phase i study of the use of thermodox for the treatment of recurrent chest wall rcw breast cancer 
from to  we generated minimal revenues and funded our operations primarily through private placements of our equity securities 
during  following fda premarketing approval of our prolieve thermodilatation system  we received a one time licensing fee of million under our agreement with boston scientific  the distributor of our prolieve system 
since receipt of the pma in february  sales of prolieve products generated revenues to us of million 
until such time as we are able to complete development and testing of  and gain necessary regulatory approvals for  one or more of our other products  sales of prolieve products may represent our only source of revenue 
we presently do not have any committed sources of financing 

table of contents we anticipate that our revenues in the next months will be generated from the sale of our prolieve system and related disposables 
the prolieve system consists of a microwave generator and conductors  along with a computer and computer software programs that control the focusing and application of heat control units  plus a specially designed  single use catheter kit 
under our agreement with boston scientific  we are entitled to receive our costs plus of the profit for each control unit measured as the difference between our costs and boston scientific s selling price determined in accordance with the agreement for each control unit and of the revenue generated by boston scientific from the sale of catheter kits  for which celsion bears the cost of goods sold 
while we anticipate strong initial sales growth for prolieve over time as the product becomes established in the market sales growth will level off 
should boston scientific exercise its option to acquire our prolieve assets and related technology for million as described further in note to our financial statements  we would not expect to generate any revenues for at least the next months 
however  the company would expect to generate investment income on the aggregate proceeds received from such sale 
in the longer term  we will attempt to develop new revenue streams from our current work with duke university in targeted drug delivery systems 
we anticipate that revenues will come from the licensing of these technologies to pharmaceutical manufacturers and from eventual sales to major institutional health care providers who would employ these technologies to deliver drug regimens throughout the body or from the sale of one or more of these technologies 
costs our principal costs consist of costs relating to the production and sale of prolieve control units and catheter kits  which are being marketed by boston scientific under a seven year agreement expiring in  research and development costs related to thermodox and prolieve  and general and administrative expenses ie corporate overhead and other costs our research and development activities  pre clinical tests and clinical trials  and the manufacturing  marketing and labeling of each of our products are subject to extensive regulation by the fda 
we may not bring to market any product in the us without fda final or fda premarketing approval 
we received such premarketing approval for our prolieve system on february  we are currently conducting basic research and development activities and pursuing prototype products through clinical testing and regulatory approval 
our ultimate objective is to commercialize those products to generate a return on investment for our stockholders through one of several means including selling products directly to end users  selling products through a distributor as is the case with our prolieve products  and licensing the technology to third parties and generating income through royalties and milestone payments

during the second quarter of  celsion conducted a voluntary class ii recall related to its disposable catheter kit in order to correct a manufacturing issue that could cause the catheter to fail to reach operating pressure during a treatment 
an investigation by the company of the new catheter kit manufacturer revealed issues in the manufacturing process and in one of the components that resulted in the performance failure 
the company has since corrected both issues and filed a supplement with the fda to approve the change in the manufacturing process 
a class ii recall is a situation in which use of the product in question may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote 
shipments of disposable catheter kits resumed in august on april  american medical systems  inc and ams research corporation together referred to as ams filed suit in the us district court for the district of minnesota alleging infringement of two patents of ams resulting from our manufacture  use and sale of the prolieve thermodilatation system

accounting policies and estimates our financial statements  which appear at item to this annual report on form k  have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require that the company make certain assumptions and estimates and  in connection therewith  adopt certain accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are set forth in note to our financial statements 
of those policies  we believe that the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and may be more critical to an accurate reflection of our financial condition and results of operations we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we track prolieve control units by serial number and cost is the actual cost of each unit 
we carry catheter kits at average cost 
carrying value does not include any general and administrative costs 
we have established an inventory reserve to reflect the estimated value of excess and obsolete inventory 
we recognize revenue on the sale of prolieve control units as they are sold to ultimate customers by boston scientific 
prolieve control units shipped to boston scientific but not yet sold to ultimate customers are reflected in finished goods inventory 
we recognize revenue on the sale of catheter kits upon shipment to boston scientific 
we include in the cost of sales the inventory carrying value of items sold  shipping and handling  miscellaneous production costs  excess and obsolescence costs and warranty expenses 
we have stock option plans that provide for non qualified and incentive stock options to be issued to directors  officers  employees and consultants 
prior to january   we accounted for options issued under the plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
no stock based compensation cost related to employee stock options was recognized in the statement of operations for the year ended december  as all options granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation cost recognized in the year ended december  includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of statement  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of statement r 

table of contents we use the black scholes model for determining the fair value of our options granted 
the black scholes model was originally developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have different characteristics from celsion s incentive and non qualified stock options 
the model is also sensitive to changes in assumptions  which can materially affect the fair value estimate 
as a result of adopting statement r on january   the company s loss before income taxes and net loss for the year ended december  are  higher than if the company had continued to account for share based compensation under opinion as a result of adopting statement r on january   the company s reported basic loss per share and diluted loss per share for the year ended december  are higher than if it had continued to account for share based compensation under opinion we review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies on an ongoing basis to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosure system provides accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
as part of the process  the company reviews the selection  application and communication of critical accounting policies and financial disclosures 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that our management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period

our business model will generate uneven cash flows  as continuing research and development expenditures will not necessarily be matched by revenues from one of the above sources 
in the event that our annual research and development expenditures are not covered by current revenues  funding will be provided from other sources including any cash on hand  revenues provided as above  income generated from licensing agreements and debt or equity funding raised in the capital markets
