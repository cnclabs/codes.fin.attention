critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following significant accounting policies  among others  affect its judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  profit recognition and allowance for bad debt  derivatives  accounting for income taxes  impairment of long lived assets  share based compensation  and goodwill 
revenue recognition  profit recognition and allowance for bad debts revenues consist of monthly recurring fees for colocation  exchange point  and managed and professional services fees 
colocation revenues also include monthly rental income for unconditioned space in our nap of the americas 
revenues from colocation and exchange point services  as well as rental income for unconditioned space  are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
installation fees and related direct costs are deferred and recognized ratably over the expected life of the customer installation  which is estimated to be to months 

table of contents managed and professional services are recognized in the period in which the services are provided 
revenues also include equipment resales which are recognized in the period in which the equipment is delivered 
revenue from contract settlements is generally recognized when collectibility is reasonably assured and no remaining performance obligation exists 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  when more than one element such as equipment  installation and colocation services are contained in a single arrangement  we allocate revenue between the elements based on acceptable fair value allocation methodologies  provided that each element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting 
an item is considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the fair value of the undelivered elements is determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately  or in cases when the item is not sold separately  by the using other acceptable objective evidence 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from customers 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
as of march  and  accounts receivable amounted to million and million  respectively 
these amounts are net of allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately million and million  respectively 
we analyze current economic news and trends  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating revenue recognition and the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts 
customer contracts generally require us to meet certain service level commitments 
if we do not meet the required service levels  we may be obligated to provide credits  usually a month of free service 
such credits  to date  have not been material 
derivatives we have  in the past  used financial instruments  including swaps and cap agreements  to manage exposures to movements in interest rates 
the use of these financial instruments is designed to modify our exposure to these risks 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
however  our senior convertible notes  due june  and our senior subordinated convertible notes  due june   collectively  the notes contain embedded derivatives that require separate valuation from the notes 
we recognize these derivatives as assets or liabilities on our balance sheet and measure them at their estimated fair value  and recognize changes in their estimated fair value in earnings in the period of change 
we estimated that the embedded derivatives classified as liabilities had an estimated fair value of approximately million as of march   and estimated fair value of approximately million as of march  during  we entered into our series b notes  due june   which contained an embedded derivative classified as an asset 
we estimated that the embedded derivatives classified as an asset had an estimated fair value of approximately million as of march  the embedded derivatives derive their value primarily based on changes in the price and volatility of our common stock 
the closing price of our common stock decreased to as of march  from per share as of march  as a result  during the year ended march   we recognized income of million due to the change in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives 
during the years ended march  and  we recognized an expense of million and income of million due to the change in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives  respectively 
with the assistance of a third party  we estimate the fair value of our embedded derivatives using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies 
over the life of the notes  given the historical volatility of our common stock  changes in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives are expected to have a material effect on our results of operations 
furthermore  we have estimated the fair value of these embedded derivatives using a theoretical model based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the past twelve 
table of contents months of 
if an active trading market develops for the notes or we are able to find comparable market data  we may in the future be able to use actual market data to adjust the estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives 
such adjustment could be significant and would be accounted for prospectively 
accounting for income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  we consider estimates of future taxable income 
beginning in the first quarter ended june   we will adopt financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
as amended accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
as a result of the adoption of fin  any adjustments will be reflected as an opening adjustment to retained earnings  as of april  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements 
we follow the guidance established in eitf issue no 
 income tax consequences of issuing convertible debt with a beneficial conversion feature eitf which concludes that i the issuance of convertible debt with a beneficial conversion feature results in a basis difference that should be accounted for as a temporary difference and ii the establishment of the deferred tax liability for the basis difference should result in an adjustment to additional paid in capital 
we believe that the underlying concepts in eitf should be similarly applied to debt for which an embedded derivative has been bifurcated under fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivatives instruments and hedging activities 
this application results in the recognition of deferred taxes upon issuance for the temporary differences existing on both the debt instrument and the embedded derivative 
subsequent changes in fair value of embedded derivatives will result in remeasurement of the related deferred tax account 
we currently have provided for a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
based on the available objective evidence  management does not believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realizable in the future 
an adjustment to the valuation allowance would benefit net income in the period in which such determination is made if we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future 
our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  amounting to approximately million  begin to expire in on april   terremark holdings  inc merged with amtec  inc 
we determined that the net operating losses generated prior to the amtech merger may have been limited by federal tax laws that impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change for tax purposes  as defined in section of the internal revenue code 
such a limitation is effective for a five year period 
as a result  we determined that we are no longer limited in utilizing net operating losses generated prior to the amtec merger 
should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
such events and circumstances include  but are not limited to  prolonged industry downturns  significant decline in our market value and significant reductions in our projected cash flows 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future 
table of contents cash flows  including long term forecasts of the number of additional customer contracts  profit margins  terminal growth rates and discounted rates 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
as of march  and  our long lived assets  including property and equipment  net and identifiable intangible assets  totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
share based compensation on april   we adopted the fair value provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments by estimating the fair value of options at grant date using the black scholes merton option pricing model and the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
calculating the fair value of option awards requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected term  risk free interest rates  expected dividends and stock price volatility 
management bases expected term in accordance with sab and expected volatility on historical volatility trends and our peer group s common stock over the period commensurate with the expected term 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period and could result in subsequent increases or decreases in compensation expense 
see note  share based compensation  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on share based compensation 
on march   the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the vesting  effective as of march   of all unvested stock options previously granted under our stock option and executive incentive compensation plans 
the options affected by this accelerated vesting had exercise prices ranging from to 
as a result of the accelerated vesting  options to purchase approximately  shares became immediately exercisable 
all other terms of these options remain unchanged 
goodwill goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives are not amortized  but rather  are tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step approach 
the first step involves a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units with its respective carrying amount 
if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed 
the second step involves a comparison of the implied fair value to the carrying value of that reporting unit s goodwill 
to the extent that a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized 
identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount 
an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives 
as of march  and  our goodwill totaled approximately million for both years 
goodwill represents the carrying amount of the excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in conjunction with i the acquisition of a corporation holding rights to develop and manage facilities catering to the telecommunications industry and ii the acquisition of a managed host service provider in europe 
we performed the annual tests for impairment for the rights to develop and manage facilities catering to the telecommunications industry in the quarters ended march  and  and concluded that there were no impairments 
we performed the annual tests for impairment for goodwill  related to our managed host service provider  acquired in august  in the quarter ended september  and concluded that there were no impairments

table of contents the net loss from data center operations is primarily the result of insufficient revenues to cover our operating and interest expenses 
we will generate net losses until we reach required levels of monthly revenues 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended march   we generated income from operations of million and our net loss amounted to million 
prior to this  we incurred losses from operations in each quarter and annual period dating back to our merger with amtec  inc cash used in operations for the year ended march  was approximately million compared to million for the year ended march  our working capital increased from million at march  to million at march  sources and uses of cash cash used in operations for the year ended march  was approximately million as compared to cash used in operations of million for the year ended march  we used cash to primarily fund our operations  including cash interest payments on our debt

the third step is the refinancing of our existing mortgage debt and senior secured notes 
our nap of the americas facility in miami was recently appraised at a value of approximately million  which has not been completed but for which we have obtained commitments in an aggregate amount equal to million from credit suisse and tannenbaum capital partners 
the funding commitment is subject to customary conditions  including the completion or definitive documentation for the facilities 
we intend to leverage this strategic asset to accomplish this refinancing and raise additional debt to complete the funding of our expansion plans in culpeper  virginia and silicon valley 
as of march   our principal source of liquidity was our million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and our million in accounts receivable

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not entered into any financial instruments for trading purposes 
however  the estimated fair value of the derivatives embedded within our senior convertible notes and series b notes create a market risk exposure resulting from changes in the price of our common stock 
these embedded derivatives derive their value primarily based on the price and volatility of our common stock  however  we do not expect significant changes in the near 
table of contents term in the one year historical volatility of our common stock used to calculate the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives 
other factors being equal  as of march   the table below provides information about the estimated fair value of the derivatives embedded within our senior convertible notes and series b notes and the effect that changes in the price of our common stock are expected to have on the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives estimated fair value of price per share of common stock embedded derivatives our exposure to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates results from the variable rate of our mortgage loan  as an increase in interest rates would result in lower earnings and increased cash outflows 
the interest rate on our mortgage loan is payable at variable rates indexed to libor 
the effect of each increase in the libor rate on our mortgage loan at march  would result in an annual increase in interest expense of approximately million 
our senior convertible notes and our senior secured notes have fixed interest rates and  accordingly  are not exposed to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates 
however  the fair market value of our long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
these interest rate changes may affect the fair market value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows 
our carrying values of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses are reasonable approximations of their fair value 
as noted above  the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives increases as the price of our common stock increases 
these changes in estimated fair value will affect our results of operations but will not impact our cash flows 
to date  over of our recognized revenue has been denominated in us dollars  generated mostly from customers in the us  and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations has been minimal 
in the future  a larger portion of our revenues may be derived from operations outside of the us and may be denominated in foreign currency 
as a result  future operating results or cash flows could be impacted due to currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar 
furthermore  to the extent we engage in international sales that are denominated in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our services less competitive in the international markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we cannot conclude that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future 
some of our operating costs are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices 
the commodity most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of significant price change is electricity 
we are closely monitoring the cost of electricity 
to the extent that electricity costs rise  we have the ability to pass these additional power costs onto our customers that utilize this power 
we do not employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge commodity price risk
