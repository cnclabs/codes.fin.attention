critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we continually evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates 
we believe the critical accounting policies listed below reflect significant judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount estimated to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from extending credit to our customers 
in judging the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider multiple factors  including historical bad debt experience  the general economic environment  the need for specific client reserves and the aging of our outstanding receivables 
a portion of this provision is included in operating expenses as a general and administrative expense and a portion of this provision is included as a reduction of license revenue 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing these factors 
if the factors utilized in determining the allowance do not reflect future performance  then a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts would be necessary in the period such determination has been made  which would impact future results of operations 
as of december   the allowance for doubtful accounts was  for gross accounts receivable of million 
deferred taxes significant judgment is required in determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we must assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance  it must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
as of december   the consolidated balance sheet included net deferred tax assets of million 
our methodology for determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets involves estimates of future taxable income from our core business  the estimated impact of future tax deductions from the exercise of stock options outstanding as of each balance sheet date  and the expiration dates and amounts of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits 
these estimates are projected through the life of the related deferred tax assets based on assumptions which we believe to be reasonable and consistent with current operating results 
although we had cumulative pre tax income for financial reporting purposes for the three years ended december   we did not pay any significant income taxes for that period due to tax deductions from the exercise of stock options as well as our utilization of net operating losses 
in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets as of each balance sheet date  we considered evidence regarding our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
the primary evidence considered included the cumulative pre tax income for financial reporting purposes for the past three years  the estimated impact of future tax deductions from the exercise of stock options outstanding as of december   and the estimated future taxable income based on historical operating results 
after giving consideration to these factors  we concluded that it was more likely than not that the tax loss carryforwards will be realized prior to expiration and that other tax credits that expire prior to will not be utilized due to the estimated future tax deductions from the exercise of stock options outstanding as of december  as well as utilization of tax loss carryforwards 
as a result  we have a valuation allowance of  as of december  relating to net operating losses and tax credits that expire prior to we also concluded that it was more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets of million as of december  and the estimated future tax deductions from the exercise of stock options outstanding as of december  would be utilized prior to expiring 
based on this conclusion  we will require approximately million in cumulative future taxable income to be generated at various times over the next years to realize the related net deferred tax assets of million as of december  as well as the estimated future tax deductions from the exercise of stock options outstanding and in the money as of december  if we adjust either our estimates of future taxable income or tax deductions from the exercise of stock options down  or our stock price increases significantly without an increase in taxable income  causing us to believe that our deferred tax assets will not be utilized  we may need to establish additional valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used  or a significant adverse change in the business climate 
if such events or changes in circumstances are present  the undiscounted cash flows method is used to determine whether the asset is impaired 
cash flows would include the estimated terminal value of the asset and exclude any interest charges 
to the extent the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining life of the asset  the impairment is measured using the discounted cash flows 
the discount rate utilized would be based on our best estimate of the related risks and return at the time the impairment assessment is made 
our long lived assets consist of property and equipment of million  other intangible assets subject to amortization of million and licensed technology of  as of december  goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we operate as one reporting unit and therefore compare the book value to the market value market capitalization plus a control premium 
if the market value exceeds the book value  goodwill is considered not impaired  and thus the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
if our book value exceeds the market value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the book value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
any loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is its new accounting basis 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized goodwill impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of that loss is completed 
we completed the annual goodwill impairment assessment as of december   in which no impairment was identified 
goodwill was million as of december  agreement with r technology  inc in april  we entered into an agreement with r technology  inc r to market r s lung nodule cad software product to our customers 
the april agreement replaced our november agreement with r under the april agreement  we committed to provide r with certain minimum quarterly sales applicable minimums from certain r lung cad related products and services r lung cad products over a quarter period ending june  we will receive a commission based on sales of r lung cad products to our customers 
to the extent the quarterly applicable minimum is not met  we will pay r the difference between the applicable minimum and the actual r lung cad product sales achieved 
in the first quarter of  we reversed  of the  expense recorded in the fourth quarter of relating to our agreement with r in the second quarter of  we recorded a  expense relating to relating to our agreement with r no such charges or reversals occurred during the second half of as of december   the remaining potential aggregate commitment under this agreement ranges from a minimum of to a maximum of approximately million 
based on information available to us  r had not generated any significant r lung cad product sales through any other sales  marketing and distribution channels  other than sales generated from customers under this agreement 
as a result  the applicable minimum for the quarter ended december  was  and the applicable minimum for the quarter ending march  is see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the estimated future aggregate applicable minimums is a highly subjective determination  and actual results and any changes to estimates could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we may not generate sufficient sales to meet the minimum contractual commitment for any particular quarter  and thus we may have to pay cash to r for the deficit 
as of december   the remaining potential aggregate applicable minimums ranged from a minimum of to a maximum of approximately million 
if we foresee that we will not be able to attain the minimum contractual commitment on a continued basis  we may have to take a charge to earnings  which could be up to the amount of the maximum remaining total commitment 
any future losses would be recorded under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires the amount to be probable and estimable 
revenue recognition we follow specific and detailed guidelines in determining the proper amount of revenue to be recorded  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
the significant judgments for revenue recognition typically involve whether collectability can be considered probable and whether fees are fixed or determinable 
significant judgment is also required when evaluating and assessing revenue recognition relating to our distribution agreements with original equipment manufacturers  value added resellers and independent distributors collectively  resellers 
in addition  our transactions often consist of multiple element arrangements  which must be analyzed to determine the fair value of each element  the amount of revenue to be recognized upon shipment  if any  and the period and conditions under which deferred revenue should be recognized 
as a result  if facts and circumstances change that affect our current judgments  our revenue could be materially different in the future 
we recognize revenue in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the aicpa  and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been shipped or the services have been provided to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
equity based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method  and therefore have not restated prior periods results 
under this method  we recognize compensation expense for all equity based payments granted on or after january  and prior to but not yet vested as of january  in accordance with sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  we recognize equity based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and recognize compensation cost only for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the award 
prior to sfas no 
r adoption  we accounted for equity based payments under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and accordingly did not recognize equity based compensation related to these options  as the exercise price equaled the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the development of assumptions that are input into the model 
these assumptions are the expected stock volatility  the risk free interest rate  the option s expected life and the dividend yield on the underlying stock 
expected volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected option life and other appropriate factors 
risk free interest rates are calculated based on continuously compounded us treasury risk free rates for the appropriate term 
prior to march   the expected life of stock options was calculated by performing a detailed analysis of all historical stock option information available 
on march   we began to grant options with a five year legal life instead of the eight year legal life that had historically been used 
as a result  we elected to use the simplified method  as described in sab  to estimate the expected life of options granted on and after march  we will utilize the simplified method until sufficient historical information becomes available on the five year legal life options 
the dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
the expected forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical experience 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of equity based payment awards require the input of the subjective assumptions described above 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of equity based payment awards represent management s best estimates  which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our equity based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the equity based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of equity based compensation 
results of operations the following table sets forth information from our statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of total revenue

during  sales of vitrea options and third party software grew faster than vitrea sales due to increased option sales both upfront and as add on purchases from our installed base of existing customers 
top selling options in and were general vessel probe  automated vessel measurement and ct cardiac all cardiovascular solutions 
as of december   we have sold approximately  separate software licenses for our solutions  compared to approximately  and  as of december  and  respectively 
license fee revenue by source is as follows for the years ended december  percent of license fee revenue direct toshiba mckesson total license fee revenue the decrease in toshiba license fee revenue as a percentage of total license fee revenue reflects our growth in pacs and direct enterprise deals 
maintenance and services revenue in thousands for the years ended december  increase decrease percent increase decrease to to to to maintenance and services revenue maintenance and support training installation total maintenance and services maintenance and services revenue increased to million in compared to million in maintenance and services revenue increased to million in compared to million in the increases in maintenance revenues in each year were due to a significant increase in our installed base of customers  increased pricing on maintenance related services and an increased maintenance renewal rate 
the increase in training revenue and installation revenue was due to an increase in the number of vitrea licenses sold each year 
also contributing to the increase in training revenue is that in the fourth quarter of  we put in place an expiration policy for unused training 
the fourth quarter was the first period we were able to expire unused training 
additionally  in the fourth quarter  we reached an agreement with one of our partners on an expiration period for training 
as a result  maintenance and services revenue during the fourth quarter of included approximately  of non recurring revenue relating to unused training that expired 
hardware revenue hardware revenue decreased to million in compared to million in hardware revenue decreased to million in compared to million in we sell hardware as a convenience to our customers  and fluctuations are driven by individual customer purchasing preferences 
sales of hardware systems are not core to our strategy and will fluctuate from period to period depending upon the needs of our customers

also contributing to the increase in was an increase in the percentage of license revenue generated outside of our toshiba relationship  as sales through toshiba have lower average revenue per transaction 
amortization charged to cost of revenue related to the hinnovation acquisition was million  million and  in  and  respectively 
as revenue continues to increase  amortization expense as a percentage of license revenue will decrease 
maintenance and services gross margin increased during and due to increased pricing on maintenance services and increased revenue from a growing installed base  without an increase in costs at a similar rate 
we will continue to invest in our training  installation  professional services and customer support areas in the future to adequately support our growing installed base of customers  as well as to evaluate maintenance and services pricing as our cost structure increases  which could have an impact on maintenance and services gross margins in the future 
the decrease in hardware gross margin during was primarily due to a maintenance and support promotion which provided customers with a discount on hardware in connection with their purchasing contracts for maintenance and support 
during  hardware gross margin increased due to increased pricing 
during we expect total gross margin to be approximately

we had  and sales and marketing personnel as of december   and  respectively 
the increase in equity based compensation costs during was the result of our adoption of sfas no 
r as of january  also  in the first quarter of  we reversed  of the  expense recorded in the fourth quarter of relating to our agreement with r in the second quarter of  we recorded a  expense relating to relating to our agreement with r see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in future periods primarily as a result of the need to support additional growth through the hiring of sales and marketing personnel 
including equity based compensation  we expect sales and marketing expenses to be between and of total revenue for the year ending december  research and development research and development expenses increased million to million in compared to million in research and development expenses increased million to million in compared to million in the change in research and development expense is as follows in thousands year over year change from fiscal year over year percent change from fiscal to to to to salaries  benefits and bonus equity based compensation depreciation consulting overhead and other expenses total the increases in expenses for both periods were due in part to increases in compensation costs as a result of additional personnel focused on product innovation and development 
we had   and research and development personnel as of december   and  respectively 
salaries  benefits and bonus for the year ended december  included a  one time charge related to the retirement of vincent argiro  our chief technology officer and founder  which was recorded in the first quarter of of this charge   is included in salaries  benefits and bonus above and  is included in equity based compensation 
the increase in equity based compensation costs during was the result of our adoption of sfas no 
r as of january  during and  we required a significant amount of temporary consulting services in completing certain research and development activities  specifically in the area of software testing and validation 
however  during we added a significant number of research and development personnel  which allowed us to rely less on outside consulting as a total percentage of research and development expense 
we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in future periods primarily as a result of additional personnel to support the expansion of our product development activities so that we can maintain our status as an industry leader in advanced visualization 
including the equity based compensation  we expect research and development expenses to be between and of total revenue for the year ending december  general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in general and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in the change in general and administrative expense is as follows in thousands year over year change from fiscal year over year percent change from fiscal to to to to salaries  benefits and bonus equity based compensation overhead and other expenses total the increase during was primarily due to higher equity based compensation costs as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
r as of january  the remaining increases in both periods were due to increases in compensation costs as a result of additional personnel and increases in overhead expenses due to the growth of the business 
we had   and general and administrative personnel as of december   and  respectively 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in future periods primarily as a result of increased personnel and administrative costs associated with various company initiatives to build the infrastructure for a larger business  as well as international expansion 
including the equity based compensation  we expect general and administrative expenses to be approximately to of total revenue for the year ending december  other items loss on operating lease in march  we signed a non cancelable operating lease for a new office facility in minnetonka  minnesota 
the new lease term started in february and expires in january we moved into the minnetonka location and moved out of the plymouth  minnesota location in february our lease for the office facility in plymouth expired on july   with the exception of a small portion of the space that was under lease until may  under the terms of the minnetonka lease  since february  the lessor paid the monthly base rent payments and taxes and operating cost rent obligation payments for our former office facility in plymouth 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a lease loss of  related to the abandonment of the plymouth office 
the estimated lease payments to be made by the minnetonka landlord to the plymouth landlord are considered a lease incentive and recorded as an immediate charge and deferred rent  which is amortized as a reduction of rent expense through the term of the lease 
acquired in process research and development results for the first quarter of included a million write off of in process research and development costs related to the hinnovation acquisition 
interest income we generated million of interest income in  compared with million in and  in during the fourth quarter of  we completed a public offering of million shares of common stock  resulting in net proceeds of million  which significantly increased interest income in the fourth quarter 
in addition to the increased interest income resulting from the offering  the increases were primarily due to increases in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which were generated from increased cash flows in all periods  and an increase in interest rates 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in our effect tax rate in from was due to the non deductibility of incentive stock options  for which the tax benefit is recorded only upon a disqualifying disposition which was a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r on january  which required that we recognize compensation expense for all equity based payments granted on or after january  and prior to but not yet vested as of january  our effective tax rate of in was impacted by non deductible in process research and development and an increase in our valuation allowance 
we estimate an effective income tax rate of approximately to in due to the utilization of deferred tax assets relating to net operating losses and tax deductions from the exercise of stock options  we do not anticipate paying any significant cash for income taxes for the next two to four years 
our methodology for determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets involves estimates of future taxable income from our core business  the estimated impact of future tax deductions from the exercise of stock options outstanding as of each balance sheet date  and the expiration dates and amounts of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits 
these estimates are projected through the life of the related deferred tax assets based on assumptions which we believe to be reasonable and consistent with current operating results 
if we adjust either our estimates of future taxable income or tax deductions from the exercise of stock options down  or our stock price increases significantly without an increase in taxable income  causing us to believe that our deferred tax assets will not be utilized  we may need to establish additional valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  million in marketable securities  working capital of million and no borrowings  as compared to million in cash and cash equivalents  million in marketable securities  working capital of million and no borrowings as of december  operating activities during  cash provided by operations was million  which consisted of net income of million  a decrease of  from changes in working capital accounts  an increase of  in deferred rent relating to payments and estimated payments to be made by our minnetonka landlord for our benefit  and an increase of million from other non cash operating activities 
changes in working capital accounts primarily related to an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in deferred revenue of million due to increased sales and an increased customer base 
days sales outstanding calculated by dividing ending net accounts receivable by revenue per day was as of december  and our aging remains relatively current  with less than of receivables greater than days past due as of december  and we use days sales outstanding as an activity measure which places emphasis and focus on accounts receivable  but this measure is not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles  and similarly titled measures may not be computed the same by other companies 
other changes in working capital accounts included an increase of  in prepaid and other current assets and an increase of  in accounts payable due to increased operating costs and general timing of payments to vendors 
during  cash provided by operations was million  which consisted of a decrease of  from changes in working capital accounts  an increase of million in deferred rent relating to payments and estimated payments to be made by our minnetonka landlord for our benefit  and an increase of million from other operating activities 
changes in working capital accounts primarily related to an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in deferred revenue of million due to increased sales and an increased customer base 
days sales outstanding as of december  increased to days  compared to days as of december   which increased as a result of a significant portion of sales occurring in the third month of the fourth quarter of other changes in working capital accounts included a decrease of  in prepaid and other current assets  an increase of  in accounts payable due to increased operating costs and general timing of payments to vendors  and an increase of million related to accruals for bonuses and royalty payments 
investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was million in we used million and million of cash in investing activities in and  respectively 
we used million  million and million for purchases of property and equipment in  and  respectively 
the purchases for all periods were principally to expand our facilities and upgrade computer equipment and to purchase computer equipment for new personnel 
we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment in the normal course of business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods are difficult to predict and depend on a number of factors  including the hiring of employees and the rate of change of computer hardware 
we used million  million and million to purchase investments in marketable securities during  and  respectively 
we realized million  million and million of proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities during  and  respectively 
the marketable securities consist of us government obligations  us government agency obligations  corporate commercial obligations and certificates of deposits 
during the first quarter of  we completed the acquisition of hinnovation  inc in accordance with the terms and conditions of an acquisition agreement and plan of reorganization dated as of january   using million of cash 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the acquisition 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the cash provided by financing activities in related primarily to the million in net proceeds from our public offering of million shares of common stock 
the cash provided by financing activities in and resulted primarily from the exercise of stock options granted under our stock plans and upon the exercise of warrants 
we have never paid or declared any cash dividends and do not intend to pay dividends in the near future 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands 
total year or less to years to years more than years operating leases off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  or agreement with r technology  inc in the first quarter of  we reversed  of the  expense recorded in the fourth quarter of relating to our agreement with r in the second quarter of  we recorded a  expense relating to relating to our agreement with r no such charges or reversals occurred during the second half of as of december   the remaining potential aggregate commitment under this agreement ranges from a minimum of to a maximum of approximately million and we estimate that we will incur no additional losses relating to this agreement 
based on information available to us  r had not generated any significant r lung cad product sales through any other sales  marketing and distribution channels  other than sales generated from customers under this agreement 
as a result  the applicable minimum for the quarter ended december  was  and the applicable minimum for the quarter ending march  is see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
other purchase commitments we had no significant outstanding purchase orders as of december  we have entered into a number of technology licensing agreements that provide for the payment of royalties when we sell vitrea 
except for the r purchase commitment described above  we are not obligated for any minimum payments under such agreements

fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return

fin is effective for us beginning january  we are currently evaluating the impact of fin item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  interest rates  indices  volatilities  correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes  and we do not enter into forward financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency rates because  as disclosed above  substantially all of our foreign transactions are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
based on the controls in place and the relative size of the financial instruments entered into  we believe the risks associated with not using these instruments would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in addition  we do not engage in speculative transactions and do not use derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 
in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risks  including changes in interest rates and price changes  which could affect our operating results 
as of december   fluctuations in interest rates  exchange rates and price changes would not have had a material effect on our financial position or operating results 
interest rate risk we place our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which generally have a term of less than one year  with a high quality financial institution and have investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million 
if  during  average short term interest rates decreased by from average rates  based on our quarterly average balance of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  our projected interest income from short term investments would have decreased by approximately  foreign currency risk substantially all of our foreign transactions are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
therefore  fluctuations in the value of the dollar as compared to other foreign currencies have not had an effect on our results of operations or financial condition
