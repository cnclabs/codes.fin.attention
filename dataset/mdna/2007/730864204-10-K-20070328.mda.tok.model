risk factors 
we have a limited operating history on which to evaluate our business 
we are a company that has only recently begun to receive operating revenue and our management has limited experience in our market 
our business model is unproven and the lack of meaningful historical financial data makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects 
to the extent that we are able to implement our business plan  our business will be subject to all of the problems that typically affect a business with a limited operating history  such as unanticipated expenses  capital shortfalls  delays in program development and possible cost overruns 
in addition  our only product  the pokerpro system  is an innovative product that has not yet been introduced to the market on a wide scale 
although we have completed development of the initial version of the pokerpro system  we are still in the process of developing and testing the software that will allow additional poker games to be played on the pokerpro system and enhancing the pokerpro system s player tracking and accounting system 
we have minimal operating revenue to date and a history of losses 
we may be unable to generate sufficient net revenue in the future to achieve or sustain profitability 
we have experienced operating losses for each quarterly and annual period since our inception in august we experienced net losses of  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  to implement our business plan and generate revenue from other sources  we must obtain necessary regulatory approvals in many additional jurisdictions 
the timing of our revenue generation will be driven in part by our receipt of such approvals in additional jurisdictions and entry into definitive agreements with customers in those jurisdictions 
we anticipate that we will incur increased expenses  losses and cash flow deficits as we seek regulatory approval for our pokerpro system and market it in various jurisdictions 
we may not receive further regulatory approvals 
for the reasons discussed above and elsewhere in this report  it is possible that we may not generate significant revenues or profits in the foreseeable future or at all 
even if we achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis  and our failure to do so would adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock and may require us to raise additional capital  which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
our success depends on the pokerpro system achieving and maintaining widespread acceptance by casinos and poker players 
our success will depend to a large extent on broad market acceptance of the pokerpro system among casinos and poker players 
even if we demonstrate the effectiveness of the pokerpro system and our business model  casinos and poker players may still not use the pokerpro system for a number of other reasons  including preference for live dealers  mistrust of technology and perceived lack of reliability 
we believe that the acceptance of the pokerpro system by casinos and poker players will depend on the following factors our ability to demonstrate the pokerpro system s economic and other benefits to casinos  players becoming comfortable with using the pokerpro system  and the reliability of the hardware and software comprising the pokerpro system 
initially  we intend to enter into month to month agreements with our customers under which we will license the software associated with the pokerpro system 
if and when market acceptance of the pokerpro system has been established  we intend to negotiate long term agreements with our customers and may sell components to customers rather than license them 
however  if the pokerpro system fails to achieve market acceptance quickly  our customers may not renew such agreements  which would reduce our net revenue and impede our efforts to market the pokerpro system 
if we fail to obtain or maintain gaming licenses and regulatory approvals  we will be unable to operate our business and license or sell our products 
the manufacture and distribution of gaming machines is subject to extensive federal  state  local and tribal regulation 
some jurisdictions require licenses  permits and other forms of approval for gaming devices 
most  if not all  jurisdictions also require licenses  permits and documentation of suitability  including evidence of financial stability  for the manufacturers and distributors of such gaming devices and for their officers  directors  major shareholders and key personnel 
our failure to obtain regulatory approval in any jurisdiction will prevent us from distributing our product and generating revenue in that jurisdiction 
obtaining requisite approvals is a time consuming and costly process and cannot be assured 
although a manufacturer of gaming devices may pursue entity regulatory approval with regulators of tribal casinos at the same time that it pursues regulatory approval for its gaming devices  states that license commercial casinos  such as nevada  require that a manufacturer obtain entity regulatory approval before seeking approval for its gaming devices 
in addition  because the pokerpro system is an innovative product  we expect that some regulatory authorities will be uncertain as to how to classify it 
we expect that this uncertainty will result in additional time and expense associated with obtaining necessary regulatory approvals 
even after incurring significant time and expense seeking such regulatory approvals  we may not be able to obtain them 
we have received approval to conduct business as a company in california  michigan  arkansas  british columbia  mississippi  and various tribal gaming jurisdictions 
we have also submitted applications in a number of major jurisdictions including nevada  new jersey  and louisiana 
our current registrations and any other registrations  licenses  approvals or findings of suitability that we may obtain may be revoked  suspended or conditioned 
the revocation or denial of a license in a particular jurisdiction means that we cannot distribute the pokerpro system in that jurisdiction  and could adversely affect our ability to obtain or maintain licenses in other jurisdictions 
gaming devices are regulated at the federal level by the johnson act 
we believe the johnson act does not apply to the use of the pokerpro system by tribal casinos because several court decisions have held that electronic aids to permitted class ii gaming devices under the igra are not prohibited by the johnson act 
however  there is no guarantee that our belief is correct 
we currently manufacture and offer electronic poker tables that we consider to be outside the scope of the johnson act 
however  we have filed under the johnson act and will maintain the required documentation under the johnson act to attempt to avoid any possible rulings prohibiting the installation of its products 
these court decisions have focused on the use by tribal casinos of electronic aids to bingo 
we are not aware of any court or regulatory body that has considered how the johnson act applies to the pokerpro system or any other form of electronic poker table 
the department of justice  the primary law enforcement entity responsible for enforcing the johnson act  has traditionally taken a broad view as to what constitutes a gambling device prohibited by the johnson act 
it is possible that the department of justice may institute criminal and civil proceedings against us and that a court may rule that the johnson act prohibits the use of the pokerpro system by tribal casinos unless the tribe and state have entered into an appropriate tribal state compact 
any such proceedings could interfere with our ability to obtain regulatory approvals in other jurisdictions 
if we fail to obtain a necessary registration  license  approval or finding of suitability in a given jurisdiction  we would likely be prohibited from distributing our pokerpro system in that jurisdiction 
in addition  some jurisdictions require license holders to obtain government approval before engaging in some transactions  such as business combinations  reorganizations  stock offerings and repurchases 
we may not be able to obtain all necessary registrations  licenses  permits  approvals or findings of suitability in a timely manner  or at all 
our failure to obtain in a timely manner necessary regulatory approvals in jurisdictions that are material to us  whether individually or in the aggregate  would have a material adverse effect on our net revenue and delay or prevent market acceptance of the pokerpro system 
gaming authorities in multiple jurisdictions have determined that certain of our executive officers  key employees  directors and significant shareholders are suitable 
the inability of an executive officer  key employee  director or significant shareholder to obtain a determination of suitability in a jurisdiction may adversely affect the introduction of pokerpro in that jurisdiction 
gaming authorities in some jurisdictions may investigate any individual who has a material relationship with us and any of our shareholders to determine whether the individual or shareholder is suitable to those gaming authorities 
certain of our executive officers  key employees  directors and significant shareholders have been found suitable in multiple jurisdictions by various gaming authorities 
if a gaming authority in any jurisdiction fails to find any of our executive officers  key employees  directors or significant shareholders suitable  we may be prohibited from leasing  licensing or selling the pokerpro system in that jurisdiction 
a finding of suitability is generally determined based upon numerous facts and circumstances surrounding the entity or individual in question and many gaming authorities have broad discretion in determining whether a particular entity or individual is suitable 
we are unaware of circumstances that would categorically prevent a gaming authority from finding any of our officers  key employees  directors or significant shareholders suitable 
gehrig h 
lou white  our chief executive officer  a director and beneficial owner of approximately of our common stock  intends to disclose in applications for the determination of suitability to be filed with gaming authorities that the irs has recently completed an examination of his and federal individual income tax returns 
the irs previously issued an examination report showing a proposed income tax deficiency for mr 
white s federal income tax return of  plus additional interest and penalties attributable to that underpayment of tax based on a disallowance of certain deductions for charitable contributions that mr 
white made to a foundation he established and mortgage interest that mr 
white paid to legacy capital  llc  an affiliate of merrill scott 
merrill scott is an investment advisor that was placed under receivership in by the sec for violations of a variety of federal securities laws in connection with fraud and misappropriations of clients funds by the firm through a scheme in which it obtained funds from its clients seeking above market returns and other benefits 
mr 
white is currently appealing the irs s proposed income tax deficiency 
the irs examination of mr 
white s federal tax return resulted in the issuance of a notice of deficiency for additional income tax in the amount of  plus additional interest and penalties attributable to that underpayment of tax 
in his original federal tax return  mr 
white claimed deductions relating to a partnership investment he made after receiving advice from a law firm 
the law firm subsequently informed mr 
white that the irs had challenged the tax treatment of the investment structure and that he should file an amended return 
mr 
white then filed an amended federal income tax return for eliminating the deductions relating to the partnership investment 
he also paid the federal income taxes resulting from the elimination of such deductions 
the irs notice of deficiency assessed additional income taxes as the result of disallowing deductions for tax advice in connection with the partnership investment transaction and an accuracy penalty in connection with the losses claimed with respect to that investment 
these amounts have been paid which completes the audit process for mr 
white s return 
due to the broad discretionary powers of gaming authorities  it is unknown what effect the irs examinations of mr 
white s federal income tax returns may have on mr 
white s applications for a determination of suitability 
if any of our executive officers  certain key employees  directors or significant shareholders is not found suitable in a jurisdiction requiring a finding of suitability  we would be prevented from leasing  licensing or selling the pokerpro system in that jurisdiction as long as the individual or entity in question remained an officer  key employee  director or a significant shareholder 
such an occurrence would likely delay our introducing the pokerpro system into such jurisdiction or prevent us from introducing the system in such jurisdictions altogether 
depending on how material such jurisdiction is to our plan of operations  failure to obtain such findings of suitability could have a material adverse effect on our result of operations 
in addition  a finding that one of our executive officers  certain key employees  directors or significant shareholders is not suitable in any jurisdiction may hinder our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals in other jurisdictions 
conversely  however  a finding of suitability by one or more gaming authorities does not ensure that similar suitability determinations will be obtained from any other gaming authorities 
although we have the ability to terminate the employment of an executive officer or key employee in the event that such executive officer or key employee fails to be found suitable  such termination would disrupt the management of our company  may trigger severance provisions under certain employment agreements and would likely have an adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations 
in addition  the removal of a director under the provisions of our amended and restated bylaws requires action on the part of our shareholders at a special shareholders meeting 
our amended and restated articles of incorporation provide that we may redeem at fair market value any or all shares of our capital stock held by any person or entity whose status as a shareholder  in the opinion of our board of directors  jeopardizes the approval  continued existence  or renewal of any federal  state  local or tribal license we hold 
however  we may not have the funds available for such a redemption  especially if the shareholder in question holds a significant amount of our common stock 
we have not determined what action we would take in such event 
we will also be prevented from effecting such a redemption if it would violate north carolina law 
because there are few significant barriers to entry to the market for our products  we could face substantial competition  which could reduce our market share and negatively impact our net revenue 
there are a number of companies that offer poker related entertainment or manufacture and distribute automated gaming machines 
most of these companies have greater financial resources than we have 
although we are unaware of any competitors offering automated poker tables such as ours  the costs of entry into the markets for competitive products are low  and there are few significant barriers to entry 
the primary barriers to entry  some of which we are still in the process of overcoming  are the establishment of relationships with the owners and operators of casinos and card clubs  the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals and the development of the technology necessary to create an automated poker table 
however  we anticipate that our potential competitors will include manufacturers of gaming devices that have already established such relationships and that have received some  if not all  of the regulatory approvals that would be required to market and sell automated poker tables in our target markets 
in addition  most of these companies have greater financial resources than we have 
therefore  we anticipate that the barriers to entry discussed above would not pose a significant obstacle for such manufacturers if they sought to compete with us 
due to the limited barriers to entry  we believe that the early establishment of market share is a key factor in our plan of operations  especially given the finite market for the pokerpro system 
if we are unable to obtain significant early market presence or we lose market share to our competitors  it may cause us to reduce the price at which we license or sell the pokerpro system  which would materially affect our net revenue 
there are many companies that could introduce directly competitive products in the short term that also have established industry relationships  the potential to develop technology quickly and greater resources than we have 
we compete in a single industry  and our business would suffer if demand for gaming in general  or poker in particular  decreases 
we expect to derive substantially all of our revenues from the leasing  licensing  and sale of the pokerpro system and from providing related maintenance and support services 
although the popularity of poker in particular and gaming in general has recently been growing in the united states and abroad  gaming has historically experienced backlash from various constituencies and communities 
public tastes are unpredictable and subject to change and may be affected by changes in the country s political and social climate 
a change in public tastes or a backlash among certain constituencies or in certain communities could result in reduced popularity of poker or increased regulation of the gaming industry  either of which could significantly reduce demand for the pokerpro system 
moreover  the market for the pokerpro system is limited  according to casino city press  as of january   there were approximately  poker tables in the united states and approximately  poker tables in other countries 
although we believe that this represents a significant opportunity for the pokerpro system  the number of venues in which the pokerpro system can be placed is finite  and the number of jurisdictions in which gaming is legal is limited 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may be able to use our technology  which could weaken our competitive position  reduce our net revenue and increase our costs 
we believe that our long term success will depend to a large degree on our ability to protect the proprietary technology that we have developed or acquired or may develop or acquire in the future 
we currently have applications for approximately patents pending before the us patent and trademark office that relate to various aspects of the pokerpro system 
however  patent applications can take many years to issue and we can provide no assurance that any of these patents will be issued 
if we are denied any or all of these patents  we may not be able to successfully prevent our competitors from imitating the pokerpro system or using some or all of the processes that are the subject of such patent applications 
such imitation may lead to increased competition within the finite market for the pokerpro system 
even if our pending patents are issued  our intellectual property rights may not be sufficiently comprehensive to prevent our competitors from developing similar competitive products and technologies 
although we intend to aggressively pursue anyone we reasonably believe is infringing upon our intellectual property rights  initiating and maintaining suits against third parties that may infringe upon our intellectual property rights will require substantial financial resources 
we may not have the financial resources to bring such suits and if we do bring such suits  we may not prevail 
regardless of our success in any such actions  we could incur significant expenses in connection with such suits 
third party claims of infringement against us could adversely affect our ability to market our products and require us to redesign our products or seek licenses from third parties 
we are susceptible to intellectual property lawsuits that could cause us to incur substantial costs  pay substantial damages or prohibit us from distributing the pokerpro system 
whether a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues  the determination of which is often uncertain 
in addition  because patent applications can take many years to issue  there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware  which may later result in issued patents that our products may infringe 
if the pokerpro system infringes a valid patent  we could be prevented from distributing the pokerpro system unless and until we can obtain a license or redesign it to avoid infringement 
a license may not be available or may require us to pay substantial royalties 
we also may not be successful in any attempt to redesign the pokerpro system to avoid any infringement 
infringement and other intellectual property claims  with or without merit  can be expensive and time consuming to litigate  and we may not have the financial and human resources to defend ourselves against any infringement suits that may be brought against us 
defects in  and fraudulent manipulation of  the pokerpro system could reduce our revenue  increase our costs  burden our engineering and marketing resources  involve us in litigation and adversely affect our gaming licenses 
our success will depend on our ability to avoid  detect and correct software and hardware defects and prevent fraudulent manipulation of the pokerpro system 
the pokerpro system is subject to rigorous internal testing  and will be subject to additional testing by regulators in certain gaming jurisdictions 
we may not be able to build and maintain products that are free from defects or manipulation and that satisfy these tests 
although we have taken steps to prevent defects and manipulations  the pokerpro system could suffer such defects and manipulation after it has been widely distributed 
although we do not believe it is likely  it is possible that an individual could breach the security systems of a casino or card club  gain access to the server on which the pokerpro system operates and fraudulently manipulate its operations 
the occurrence of such fraudulent manipulation or of defects or malfunctions could result in financial losses for our customers and the subsequent termination of agreements  cancellation of orders  product returns and diversion of our resources 
even if our customers do not suffer financial losses  casinos and card clubs may replace the pokerpro system if it does not perform according to expectations 
any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of the pokerpro system and loss of licenses and sales 
in addition  the occurrence of defects in  or fraudulent manipulation of  the pokerpro system and its associated software may give rise to claims for lost revenues and related litigation by our customers and may subject us to investigation or other disciplinary action by regulatory authorities that could include suspension or revocation of our regulatory approvals 
the use of the pokerpro system could result in product liability claims that could be expensive and that could damage our reputation and harm our business 
our business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims 
subject to contractual limitations  we will face financial exposure to product liability claims if the pokerpro system fails to work properly and causes monetary damage to either poker players or casinos and card clubs 
in addition  defects in the design or manufacture of the pokerpro system might require us to recall each pokerpro system that has been licensed 
although we maintain product liability insurance  the coverage limits of policies available to us may not be adequate to cover future claims 
if a successful claim brought against us is in excess or outside of our insurance coverage  we may be forced to divert resources from the development of the pokerpro system  the pursuit of regulatory approvals and other working capital needs in order to satisfy such claims 
the loss of the services of our chairman  chief executive officer  president or other key employees  or the failure to attract additional key individuals  would materially adversely affect our business 
our success depends on the continued services of lyle berman  who serves as the chairman of our board of directors 
in addition  although they have limited experience in the gaming industry  we believe that due to their leadership in the development of our business  our success also depends on gehrig h 
lou white  who has served as our chief executive officer since our inception  and james t 
crawford  who has served in an executive officer capacity since our inception and who currently serves as our president and secretary 
our success will also depend on retention of other key management executives who have been instrumental in our development thus far  and on our ability to attract and retain employees to complete the development of enhancements to the pokerpro system and to market it throughout the united states 
mr 
berman is the executive chairman of wpt enterprises  inc  the operator of the world poker tour 
we hope to develop business relationships from introductions to strategic partners in the gaming industry that we believe mr 
berman can facilitate 
mr 
berman is under no obligation to facilitate such introductions and if our relationship with mr 
berman is terminated or impaired  we may not be able to develop such business relationships  which could delay market acceptance of the pokerpro system and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have not entered into an employment agreement or non competition agreement with either mr 
white or mr 
crawford 
therefore  either may terminate their employment with us at any time and immediately use certain information and contacts they obtained from their employment with us to compete with our business 
the loss of mr 
white  mr 
crawford or our other senior executives or an inability to attract or retain other key individuals could materially adversely affect us 
growth in our business depends  to a large degree  on our ability to retain and attract such employees 
we seek to compensate and incentivize our key executives  as well as other employees  through competitive salaries  stock ownership and bonus plans  but these programs may not be sufficient to allow us to retain key employees or hire new employees 
our management team s limited experience in this market could increase costs  hamper our marketing strategies and delay our expansion 
we have not yet demonstrated that we are able to implement our business plan fully or in a timely manner 
the limited experience of our management team in the gaming industry and the market for automated game technology could result in increased operating and capital costs  difficulties in executing our operating and marketing strategies and delays in our expansion strategy 
our management team also has limited experience with the process of obtaining the regulatory licenses  certifications and approvals that we will need in order to market and distribute the pokerpro system in additional jurisdictions 
we may not successfully address any or all of the risks posed by this limited experience  and our failure to do so could seriously harm our business and operating results 
if we fail to manage our expected growth  our business and operating results could be harmed 
although we have not received significant operating revenue  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience rapid growth in our headcount and operations  placing significant demands on our operational and financial infrastructure 
we intend to increase modestly the number of our employees in the next months to further our research and development and sales efforts and to meet our administrative needs 
if we do not effectively manage our growth  our ability to develop and market the pokerpro system could suffer  which could negatively affect our operating results 
to manage our expected growth effectively  we must continue to improve our operational  financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures 
these systems enhancements and improvements will require significant capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources 
if required improvements are not implemented successfully  our ability to manage our expected growth will be impaired and we may have to make significant additional expenditures to address these issues 
our success will depend on the reliability and performance of third party distributors  manufacturers and suppliers 
although we currently manufacture the pokerpro system from component parts obtained from third party suppliers  we expect that when development of the pokerpro system is complete  we will retain third party manufacturers to complete all phases of manufacturing 
should the selected manufacturers not be able to meet our requirements  we would be significantly hampered from serving our customers and may miss revenue generating opportunities 
we currently obtain the touch screen monitors for the pokerpro system from a single supplier 
while changing suppliers for this component is not impossible  doing so would require significant time and effort on the part of our management team and may cause us to miss revenue generating opportunities until we are able to obtain touch screen monitors from a new supplier 
in addition  the supply of the liquid crystal display for the pokerpro system is uncertain and subject to significant backlogs from time to time due to spikes in general demand for such displays 
we compete with other companies for the production capacity of third party suppliers for these displays and for other components 
certain of these competing companies have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and thus we may be at a competitive disadvantage in seeking to procure production capacity 
our inability to contract with third party manufacturers and suppliers to provide a sufficient supply of our products on acceptable terms and on a timely basis could negatively impact our relationships with existing customers and cause us to lose revenue generating opportunities with potential customers 
we also currently rely on aristocrat  a third party distributor  to market and distribute our pokerpro system outside of the united states and canada 
we cannot predict the timing or acceptance of our product at this time 
if aristocrat is unsuccessful in marketing and distributing our product  we may miss revenue generating opportunities that might have been recognized by another third party distributor 
while changing distributors is not impossible  doing so would require significant time and effort on the part of our management team and may cause us to miss further revenue generating opportunities 
our failure to obtain any necessary additional financing would have a material adverse effect on our business 
although initially we have licensed the components of the pokerpro system to customers  in the future we may sell customers such components 
until such time as we are able to sell such hardware components to our customers  our ability to license the pokerpro system to our customers on a large scale may require us to obtain additional financing necessary for the manufacture of such hardware components 
such financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us  or at all 
our inability to obtain such financing on terms that allow us to license the pokerpro system profitably would hamper our ability to distribute pokerpro systems on a large scale and may therefore delay our ability to obtain significant market presence as well as market acceptance of the pokerpro system 
in addition  if our revenue is less than we anticipate or if we incur unforeseen expenses  we may need to seek additional equity or debt financing 
we may not be able to obtain such additional equity or debt financing when we need it or at all 
even if such financing is available  it may not be available on terms that are favorable to us or in sufficient amounts to satisfy our requirements 
if we require  but are unable to obtain  sufficient additional financing in the future we may be unable to develop the pokerpro system  further protect our intellectual property sufficiently  meet customer demand for pokerpro systems or withstand adverse operating results 
more importantly  if we are unable to raise further financing when required  our continued operations may have to be scaled down or even terminated and our ability to generate revenues would be negatively affected 
a decline in general economic conditions would have a greater material adverse effect on our business than on other businesses 
the demand for entertainment and leisure activities  including gaming activities like poker  tends to be highly sensitive to consumers disposable incomes 
therefore  a decline in general economic conditions would have more of a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition and the price of our common stock than on other businesses that are not as dependent on consumers disposable incomes 
if the network infrastructure of certain of the casinos in which the pokerpro system is or will be installed proves unreliable  market acceptance of the pokerpro system would be materially and adversely affected 
we have entered into agreements with customers that operate casinos and card clubs in more than one location 
in such cases  our agreement with such customer provides that such customer will be responsible for providing  at its expense  a dedicated high speed connection between the tables comprising the pokerpro system in the various locations operated by the customer to a remote central server supporting such tables 
failures or disruptions of a customer s dedicated high speed connection that result in the stoppage of play or in reduced performance of the pokerpro system could reduce players gaming experience  adversely affect the casinos or card clubs satisfaction with automated gaming devices in general and delay or prevent market acceptance of the pokerpro system 
enforcement of remedies or contracts against native american tribes could be difficult 
many of our contracts with native american tribes are subject to sovereign immunity and tribal jurisdiction 
if a dispute arises with respect to any of those agreements  it could be difficult for us to protect our rights 
native american tribes generally enjoy sovereign immunity from suit similar to that enjoyed by individual states and the united states 
in order to sue a native american tribe or an agency or instrumentality of a native american tribe  the tribe must have effectively waived its sovereign immunity with respect to the matter in dispute 
moreover  even if a native american tribe were to waive sovereign immunity  such waiver may not be valid and in the absence of an effective waiver of sovereign immunity by a native american tribe  we could be precluded from judicially enforcing any rights or remedies against that tribe 
our business is closely tied to the casino industry and factors that negatively impact the casino industry may also negatively affect our ability to generate revenues 
casinos and other gaming operators represent a significant portion of our customers 
therefore  factors that may negatively impact the casino industry may also negatively impact our future revenues 
if casinos experience reduced patronage  revenues may be reduced as our games may not perform well and may be taken off of the casino floor altogether 
the level of casino patronage  and therefore our revenues  are affected by a number of factors beyond our control  including general economic conditions  levels of disposable income of casino patrons  downturn or loss in popularity of the gaming industry in general  and table and slot games in particular  the relative popularity of entertainment alternatives to casino gaming  the growth and number of legalized gaming jurisdictions  local conditions in key gaming markets  including seasonal and weather related factors  increased transportation costs  acts of terrorism and anti terrorism efforts  changes or proposed changes to tax laws  increases in gaming taxes or fees  legal and regulatory issues affecting the development  operation and licensing of casinos  the availability and cost of capital to construct  expand or renovate new and existing casinos  the level of new casino construction and renovation schedules of existing casinos  and competitive conditions in the gaming industry and in particular gaming markets  including the effect of such conditions on the pricing of our games and products 
these factors significantly impact the demand for our products and technologies 
we may be forced to reduce or delay growth initiatives and capital expenditures  obtain additional equity capital or assume debt if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our operational requirements 
if our future cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to meet our operational needs and commitments  we may be forced to reduce or delay activities and capital expenditures  obtain additional equity capital or assume debt 
in the event that we are unable to do so  we may be left without sufficient liquidity and we may not be able to meet current needs
