part i item business overview silverleaf resorts  inc the company  silverleaf  we  or our was incorporated in texas in our principal business is the development  marketing  and operation of getaway and destination timeshare resorts 
as of december   we own seven getaway resorts in texas  missouri  illinois  and georgia the getaway resorts 
we also own six destination resorts in texas  missouri  massachusetts  and florida the destination resorts 
in april we purchased pinnacle lodge  a hotel property located near the winter park recreational area in colorado which provides our owners with another destination vacation alternative and gives silverleaf an entry point into this increasingly popular destination area 
the getaway resorts are designed to appeal to vacationers seeking comfortable and affordable accommodations in locations convenient to their residences and are located near major metropolitan areas 
our getaway resorts are located close to principal areas where we market our vacation products to facilitate more frequent short stay getaways 
we believe such short stay getaways are growing in popularity as a vacation trend 
our destination resorts are located in or near areas with national tourist appeal and offer our customers the opportunity to upgrade into a more upscale resort area as their lifestyles and travel budgets permit 
both the getaway resorts and the destination resorts collectively  the existing resorts provide a quiet  relaxing vacation environment 
we believe our resorts offer our customers an economical alternative to commercial vacation lodging 
the average price for an annual one week vacation ownership interval vacation interval for a two bedroom unit at the existing resorts was  for and  for owners of silverleaf vacation intervals at the existing resorts silverleaf owners enjoy certain distinct benefits 
these benefits include i use of vacant lodging facilities at the existing resorts through our bonus time program  ii year round access to the existing resorts non lodging amenities such as fishing  boating  horseback riding  swimming  tennis  or golf on a daily basis for little or no additional charge  and iii the right to exchange the use of a vacation interval at one of our existing resorts for a different time period at a different existing resort through our internal exchange program 
these benefits are subject to availability and other limitations 
most silverleaf owners may also enroll in the vacation interval exchange network operated by resort condominiums international rci 
our destination resort in florida is not under contract with rci  however it is under contract with interval international  inc  a competitor of rci 
certain significant events in january  we purchased approximately acres of undeveloped land contiguous to our orlando breeze resort in davenport  polk county  florida  just outside orlando  florida for a purchase price of million 
extensive planning and pre development work must be completed before we can begin developing the property 
in addition  development of the property is subject to state and local governmental approvals necessary before commencing timeshare operations on this acre tract 
in march  we opened our first showroom style  off site sales office 
the showroom  located in the dallas fort worth metroplex in irving  texas  operates under the name silverleaf vacation store 
it offers potential customers an interactive virtual experience of our resorts  including a model unit  photo gallery  and film presentation for each of our current resorts and their related amenities 
the  square foot showroom cost approximately million and employs approximately to on site sales personnel 
we believe this new showroom will generate between million to million in annual sales to new members 
the showroom will provide us with a significant sales opportunity by enabling potential customers to experience the quality and service of our resorts in their own community 
we expect that new owners who purchase at these showrooms will later participate in our upgrade and additional week sales programs 
in march  we closed a million revolving senior credit facility through a newly formed  wholly owned and consolidated special purpose finance subsidiary  silverleaf finance iv  llc sf iv  a delaware limited liability company 
sf iv was formed for the purpose of issuing a million variable funding note vfn to ubs real estate securities inc ubs 
during the fourth quarter of the facility was amended to increase funding availability from million to million 
the funding period was originally scheduled to end in march but was extended to december  and the interest rate on advances by ubs to sf iv was reduced from the initial rate of libor plus to libor plus 
the revised facility will mature in december the vfn is secured by customer notes receivable sold to sf iv 
proceeds from the sale of customer notes receivable to sf iv are used to fund normal business operations and for general working capital purposes 
the vfn was issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of an indenture between sf iv  ubs  and wells fargo bank  national association  as indenture trustee 
we will service the customer notes receivable sold to sf iv under the terms of an agreement with the indenture trustee and sf iv 
in april  we acquired property located near the winter park recreational area in colorado for a purchase price of approximately million 
the property is currently being operated as the pinnacle lodge  a room hotel 
we will continue to operate the property as a hotel as well as a destination for our current timeshare owners 
in august  we closed a million term securitization transaction through our newly formed  wholly owned and consolidated special purpose finance subsidiary  silverleaf finance v  lp sf v  a delaware limited partnership 
sf v was formed for the purpose of issuing approximately million of its timeshare loan backed notes series a series a notes in a private offering and sale through ubs securities llc ubs 
the series a notes were issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of an indenture between ourselves as servicer  sf v  as issuer  and wells fargo bank  national association  as indenture trustee  custodian  backup servicer  and account intermediary 
the series a notes were issued in seven classes ranging from class a through class g notes with a blended fixed rate of 
the class a through class g notes have been rated aaa  aa  a  baa  baa  baa  and ba respectively by moody s investors service  inc  and have a final maturity of july the series a notes are secured by customer notes receivable sold to sf v by sf iv and silverleaf in three separate transactions from august to november the original amount of notes receivable purchased by sf v to secure the series a notes was million and the balance of eligible notes receivable pledged as collateral at december  was million 
the proceeds from the sale of the customer notes receivable to sf v were primarily used to pay down consolidated indebtedness to senior lenders 
all customer notes receivable purchased by sf v are being acquired without recourse  except in the case of breaches of customary representations and warranties made in connection with the sale of the notes 
we will continue to service the customer notes receivable sold to sf v under the terms of the indenture and will receive a fee for our services 
certain significant events subsequent to we entered into a consolidated  amended and restated loan and security agreement the agreement with textron financial corporation effective february  our current receivables and inventory financing arrangements were consolidated into one facility  with a reduction in the interest rate on the receivables component from prime rate plus to the prime rate 
the interest rate on advances under the acquisition component and the inventory component of the consolidated debt are now prime rate plus 
the interest rates charged under our prior inventory loan agreements with textron were the prime rate plus and libor plus 
the funding period has been extended from june to january the receivables component matures on january   and the acquisition and inventory component each mature on january  the new terms of the agreement will provide us with additional liquidity to acquire additional developed or undeveloped properties 
we listed our common stock on the nasdaq capital market nasdaq  under the symbol svlf  effective as of the opening of the market on february  as a result  trading in silverleaf common stock ceased on the american stock exchange effective at the closing of the markets on february  operations our primary business is marketing and selling vacation intervals from our inventory to individual consumers 
our principal activities in this regard include acquiring and developing timeshare resorts  marketing and selling one week annual and biennial vacation intervals to prospective first time owners  marketing and selling upgraded and additional vacation intervals to existing silverleaf owners  financing the purchase of vacation intervals  and managing timeshare resorts 
we have in house capabilities which enable us to coordinate all aspects of development and expansion of the existing resorts and the potential development of any future resorts  including site selection  design  and construction pursuant to standardized plans and specifications 
we perform substantial marketing and sales functions internally 
we have made significant investments in operating technology  including telemarketing and computer systems and proprietary software applications 
we identify potential purchasers through internally developed marketing techniques and through cooperative arrangements with outside vendors 
we sell vacation intervals predominately through on site sales offices located at certain of our resorts  which are located near major metropolitan areas 
this practice provides us an alternative to marketing costs of subsidized airfare or lodging  which are typically associated with the timeshare industry 
in  we began marketing and sales activity at our first off site sales center  which is located in the dallas ft 
worth metroplex 
as part of the vacation interval sales process  we offer potential purchasers financing of up to of the purchase price over a seven year to ten year period 
we have historically financed our operations by borrowing from third party lending institutions at an advance rate of to of eligible customer receivables 
at december  and  we had a portfolio of approximately  and  customer promissory notes  respectively  totaling approximately million and million  respectively  with an average yield of and per annum  respectively  which compares favorably to our weighted average cost of borrowings of per annum at december  we cease recognition of interest income when collection is no longer deemed probable 
at december  and  approximately million and million in principal  or and  respectively  of our loans to silverleaf owners were to days past due 
as of december  and  no timeshare loans receivable were over days past due 
we continue collection efforts with regard to all timeshare notes receivable from customers until all collection techniques that we utilize have been exhausted 
we provide for uncollectible notes by reserving an estimated amount that our management believes is sufficient to cover anticipated losses from customer defaults 
each timeshare resort has a timeshare owners association a club 
at december   each club other than the club at orlando breeze operates through a centralized organization to manage its respective resort on a collective basis 
this centralized organization is silverleaf club  a texas not for profit corporation 
silverleaf club is under contract with each club for each of the existing resorts with the exception of orlando breeze to operate and manage their resort 
in turn  we have a contract management agreement with silverleaf club  under which we perform the supervisory and management functions of the resorts on a collective basis 
all costs of operating the timeshare resorts  including management fees payable to us under the management agreement  are to be covered by monthly dues paid by the timeshare owners to their respective clubs as well as income generated by the operation of certain amenities at the timeshare resorts 
orlando breeze has its own club orlando breeze resort club  which is operated independently of silverleaf club 
we also provide certain supervisory and management functions for orlando breeze resort club under the terms of a written agreement 
marketing and sales marketing is the process by which we attract potential customers to visit and tour an existing resort or attend a sales presentation 
sales is the process by which we seek to sell a vacation interval to a potential customer once he arrives for a tour at an existing resort or attends a sales presentation 
marketing 
our in house marketing staff creates databases of new prospects  which are principally developed through cooperative arrangements with outside vendors to identify prospects that meet our marketing criteria 
using our automated dialing and bulk mailing equipment  in house marketing specialists conduct coordinated telemarketing and direct mail procedures which invite prospects to tour one of our resorts and receive an incentive  such as a free gift  without regard to whether or not an interval is purchased 
sales 
we sell our vacation intervals primarily through on site salespersons at certain existing resorts 
upon arrival at an existing resort for a scheduled tour  the prospect is met by a member of our sales force who leads the prospect on a minute tour of the resort and its amenities 
at the conclusion of the tour  the sales representative explains the benefits and costs of becoming a silverleaf owner 
the presentation also includes a description of the financing alternatives that we offer 
prior to the closing of any sale  a verification officer interviews each prospect to ensure our compliance with sales policies and regulatory agency requirements 
the verification officer also plays a bonus time video for the customer to explain the advantages of and limitations on the bonus time program 
no sale becomes final until a statutory waiting period which varies from state to state of three to fifteen calendar days has passed 
we also sell our vacation intervals to existing silverleaf owners as either upgraded sales of more desirable higher priced vacation intervals or additional week vacation interval sales 
sales representatives receive commissions ranging from to of the sales price of a vacation interval depending on established guidelines 
sales managers also receive commissions of to and are subject to commission chargebacks in the event the purchaser fails to make the first required payment 
sales directors also receive commissions of to  which are also subject to chargebacks 
prospects who are interested in a lower priced product are offered biennial alternate year intervals or other lower priced products that entitle the prospect to sample a resort for a specified number of nights 
the prospect may apply the cost of a lower priced product against the down payment on a vacation interval if the interval is purchased by a certain date 
in addition  we actively market both on site and off site upgraded vacation intervals to existing silverleaf owners  as well as additional week sales to existing silverleaf owners 
although most upgrades and additional week sales are sold by our in house sales staff  we have contracted with a third party to assist in offsite marketing of these at the destination resorts 
we have been focusing on increasing the percentage mix of sales to existing customers in and these upgrade and additional week programs have been well received by silverleaf owners and accounted for approximately and of our gross revenues from vacation interval sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
by offering lower priced products and upgraded and additional week vacation intervals  we believe we offer an affordable product for all prospects in our target market 
also  by offering products with a range of prices  we attempt to broaden our market with initial sales of lower priced products  which we attempt to gradually upgrade and or augment with additional week sales over time 
in march  we opened our first showroom style  off site sales office 
the showroom  located in the dallas fort worth metroplex in irving  texas  operates under the name silverleaf vacation store 
it offers potential customers an interactive virtual experience of our resorts  including a model unit  photo gallery  and film presentation for each of our current resorts and their related amenities 
the  square foot showroom cost approximately million and employs approximately to on site sales personnel 
after a nine to twelve month ramp up period  we believe this new showroom will generate between million to million in annual sales to new members 
the showroom will provide us with a significant sales opportunity by enabling potential customers to experience the quality and service of our resorts in their own community 
we expect that new owners who purchase at these showrooms will later participate in our upgrade and additional week sales programs 
our sales representatives are a critical component of our sales and marketing effort 
we continually strive to attract  train  and retain a dedicated sales force 
we provide intensive sales instruction and training  which assists the sales representatives in acquainting prospects with the resort s benefits 
our sales instruction and training also focuses on compliance by each sales representative with all federal  state  and local laws applicable to timeshare sales 
each sales representative is our employee and receives some employment benefits 
at december   we employed sales representatives 
seasonality our sales of vacation intervals have generally been lower in the months of november and december 
cash flow and earnings may be impacted by the timing of development  the completion of future resorts  and the potential impact of weather or other conditions in the regions where we operate 
our operating results could be negatively impacted by these factors 
customer financing we offer financing to buyers of vacation intervals at our resorts 
buyers who elect to finance their purchases through us typically make down payments of at least of the purchase prices and deliver promissory notes for the balances 
the promissory notes generally bear interest at a fixed rate  are generally payable over a seven year to ten year period  and are secured by a first mortgage on the vacation interval 
we bear the risk of defaults on these promissory notes 
in  we began obtaining a pre screen credit score on touring families 
if the credit score does not meet certain minimum credit criteria  a down payment is generally required instead of our standard down payment 
there are a number of risks associated with financing customers purchases of vacation intervals 
for an explanation of these risks  please see risk factors beginning on page of this report 
in we accrued of the purchase price of vacation intervals as estimated uncollectible revenue  which is an offset to vacation interval sales 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 this line item was recorded as an expense provision for uncollectible notes 
the allowance for uncollectible notes was of gross notes receivable as of december  compared to at december  we plan to continue our current collection programs and seek new programs to reduce note defaults and improve the credit quality of our customers 
however  there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful 
if a buyer of a vacation interval defaults  we generally must foreclose on the vacation interval and attempt to resell it 
when this occurs the associated marketing  selling  and administrative costs from the original sale are not recovered and sales and marketing costs must be incurred again to resell the vacation interval 
although  in many cases  we may have recourse against a vacation interval buyer for the unpaid price  certain states have laws that limit or hinder our ability to recover personal judgments against customers who have defaulted on their loans 
for example  under texas law  if we pursue a post foreclosure deficiency claim against a customer  the customer may file a court proceeding to determine the fair market value of the property foreclosed upon 
in such event  we may not recover a personal judgment against the customer for the full amount of the deficiency  but may recover only to the extent that the indebtedness owed to the company exceeds the fair market value of the property 
accordingly  we do not generally pursue this remedy because we have not found it to be cost effective 
at december   we had notes receivable including notes unrelated to vacation intervals in the approximate principal amount of million with an allowance for uncollectible notes of approximately million 
additionally  at december   our off balance sheet finance subsidiary  sf iii  held notes receivable totaling million  with related borrowings of million 
except for the repurchase of notes that fail to meet initial eligibility requirements  we are not obligated to repurchase defaulted or any other contracts sold to sf iii 
as the servicer of the notes receivable sold to sf iii  we are obligated by the terms of the conduit facility to foreclose upon the vacation interval securing a defaulted note receivable 
we may  but are not obligated to  purchase the foreclosed vacation interval for an amount equal to the net fair market value of the vacation interval  which may not be less than fifteen percent of the original acquisition price that the customer paid for the vacation interval 
for the year ended december   we paid approximately million to repurchase the vacation intervals securing defaulted notes receivable to facilitate the re marketing of those vacation intervals 
our total investment in sf iii was valued at million at december  we recognize interest income as earned 
interest income is accrued on notes receivable  net of an estimated amount that will not be collected  until the individual notes become days delinquent 
once a note becomes days delinquent  the accrual of interest income ceases until collection is deemed probable 
we intend to borrow either directly or through our fully consolidated special purpose finance subsidiaries additional funds under our existing revolving credit facilities with our lenders to finance our operations 
at december   we and our fully consolidated subsidiaries  had borrowings under our credit facilities in the approximate principal amount of million  of which million of such facilities are receivables based and currently permit borrowings of to of the principal amount of performing notes 
payments from silverleaf owners on such notes are credited directly to the senior lender and applied against our loan balance 
at december   we had a portfolio of approximately  vacation interval customer promissory notes in the approximate principal amount of million  of which approximately million in principal amount was days or more past due and therefore ineligible as collateral 
at december   our portfolio of customer notes receivable had an average yield of 
at such date  our borrowings had a weighted average cost of  and had a fixed to floating debt ratio of fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
we have historically derived net interest income from our operating activities because the interest rates we charge our customers who finance the purchase of their vacation intervals exceed the interest rates we pay our senior lenders 
because of our existing indebtedness currently bears interest at variable rates and our customer notes receivable bear interest at fixed rates  increases in interest rates would erode the spread in interest rates that we have historically experienced and could cause our interest expense on borrowings to exceed our interest income on our portfolio of customer loans 
therefore  any increase in interest rates  particularly if sustained  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition 
to partially offset an increase in interest rates  we have engaged in two interest rate hedging transactions  or derivatives  related to our conduit loan through silverleaf finance ii  inc  a delaware corporation  for a notional amount of million at december   that expires between september and march sf iv s vfn also acts as an interest rate hedge since it contains a provision for an interest rate cap  however there are no amounts outstanding under this line of credit at december  in addition  the series a notes related to our off balance sheet special purpose finance subsidiary  sf iii  with a balance of million at december   bear interest at a blended fixed rate of  and our series a notes related to sf v bear interest at a blended fixed rate of 
limitations on availability of financing would inhibit sales of vacation intervals due to i the lack of funds to finance the initial negative cash flow that results from sales that we finance  and ii reduced demand if we are unable to provide financing to purchasers of vacation intervals 
we ordinarily receive only to of the purchase price as a cash down payment on the sale of a vacation interval that we finance  but we must pay in full the costs of developing  marketing  and selling the vacation interval 
maximum borrowings available under our current credit agreements may not be sufficient to cover these costs  thereby straining capital resources  liquidity  and capacity to grow 
in addition  to the extent interest rates decrease generally on loans available to our customers  we face an increased risk that customers will pre pay their loans and reduce our income from operating activities 
we typically provide financing to customers over a seven year to ten year period 
our customer notes receivable had an average maturity of years at december  our credit facilities have scheduled maturities between april and july additionally  our revolving credit facilities could be declared immediately due and payable as a result of any default by us 
although it appears that we have adequate liquidity to meet our needs through at least december  we are continuing to identify additional financing arrangements beyond such date 
in the first quarter of  we consolidated our debt with textron financial corporation into one revolving loan 
as a result of the amended and restated loan and security agreement  the funding period on the consolidated debt has been extended from june to january  with revised maturity dates of january  for the receivables component and january  on both the acquisition and inventory components 
in addition  the interest rates previously charged have been reduced 
this transaction is described in more detail under the heading subsequent events in note to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f development and acquisition process we intend to develop at our existing resorts and or acquire new resorts only to the extent we deem such expansion financially beneficial  and then only as the capital markets permit 
if we are able to develop or acquire new resorts  we will do so under our established development policies 
before committing capital to a site  we test the market using our own market analysis testing techniques and explore the zoning and land use laws applicable to the potential site and the regulatory issues pertaining to licenses and permits for timeshare marketing  sales  and operations 
we also contact various governmental entities and review applications for necessary governmental permits and approvals 
if we are satisfied with our market analysis and regulatory review  we will prepare a conceptual layout of the resort  including building site plans and resort amenities 
after we apply our standard lodging unit design and amenity package  we prepare a budget that estimates the cost of developing the resort  including costs of lodging facilities  infrastructure  and amenities  as well as projected sales  marketing  and general and administrative costs 
we typically perform additional due diligence  including obtaining an environmental report by an environmental consulting firm  a survey of the property  and a title commitment 
we employ legal counsel to review these documents and pertinent legal issues 
if we are satisfied with the site after the environmental and legal review  we will complete the purchase of the property 
we manage all construction activities internally 
we typically complete the development of a new resort s basic infrastructure and models within one year  with additional units to be added within to days based on demand  weather permitting 
a normal part of the development process is the establishment of a functional sales office at the new resort 
clubs silverleaf club the silverleaf club directors are elected by the majority of the boards of directors of the individual clubs 
we have the right to supervise the management of our resorts under the terms of the management agreement 
the silverleaf owners are obligated to pay monthly dues to their respective clubs  which obligation is secured by a lien on their vacation interval in favor of their club 
if a silverleaf owner fails to pay his monthly dues  his club may institute foreclosure proceedings regarding the delinquent silverleaf owner s vacation interval 
the number of foreclosures that occurred as a result of silverleaf owners failing to pay monthly dues was  in and in typically  we purchase at foreclosure all vacation intervals that are the subject of foreclosure proceedings instituted by the club because of delinquent dues 
at december   the club at each timeshare resort other than orlando breeze operates through a centralized organization provided by silverleaf club to manage the resorts on a collective basis 
the consolidation of resort operations through silverleaf club permits i a centralized reservation system for all resorts  ii substantial cost savings by purchasing goods and services for all resorts on a group basis  which generally results in a lower cost of goods and services than if such goods and services were purchased by each resort on an individual basis  iii centralized management for the entire resort system  iv centralized legal  accounting  and administrative services for the entire resort system  and v uniform implementation of various rules and regulations governing all resorts 
all furniture  furnishings  recreational equipment  and other personal property used in connection with the operation of the existing resorts are owned by either that resort s club or the silverleaf club  rather than by us 
orlando breeze has its own club  orlando breeze resort club  which is operated independently of silverleaf club  however  we supervise the management and operation of the orlando breeze resort club under the terms of a written agreement 
at december   silverleaf club had full time employees and orlando breeze resort club had full time employees 
each club is solely responsible for their salaries  as well as the direct expenses of operating the existing resorts  while we are responsible for the direct expenses of new development and all marketing and sales activities 
to the extent silverleaf club provides payroll  administrative  and other services that directly benefit the company  we reimburse silverleaf club for such services and vice versa 
silverleaf club collects dues from silverleaf owners  plus certain other amounts assessed against the silverleaf owners from time to time  and generates income by the operation of certain amenities at the existing resorts 
silverleaf club and orlando breeze resort club dues were approximately per month for biennial owners during  except for certain members of oak n spruce resort  who prepay dues at an annual rate of approximately such amounts are used by the respective clubs to pay the costs of operating the existing resorts and the management fees due to the company pursuant to management agreements 
the management agreement with silverleaf club authorizes the company to supervise the management and operations of the resorts and provides for a maximum management fee equal to of gross revenues of silverleaf club  but our right to receive such a fee on an annual basis is limited to the amount of silverleaf club s net income 
however  if we do not receive the maximum fee  such deficiency is deferred for payment to succeeding years  subject again to the annual net income limitation 
the management agreement between orlando breeze resort club and us authorizes us to supervise management and operation of orlando breeze resort and provides for a maximum annual management fee equal to of gross revenues of orlando breeze resort club  but our right to receive such a fee on an annual basis is limited to the amount of orlando breeze resort club s net income 
however  if we do not receive the maximum fee  such deficiency is deferred for payment to succeeding years  subject again to the annual net income limitation 
due to anticipated refurbishment of units at the existing resorts  together with the operational and maintenance expenses associated with our current expansion and development plans  our management fees were subject to the annual net income limitation 
accordingly  for the year ended december   management fees recognized were million 
for financial reporting purposes  management fees from silverleaf club are recognized based on the lower of i the aforementioned maximum fees or ii silverleaf club s net income 
the silverleaf club management agreement is effective through march  and will continue year to year thereafter unless cancelled by either party 
as a result of the past performance of the silverleaf club  it is uncertain whether silverleaf club will consistently generate positive net income 
therefore  future income to the company under the management agreement with silverleaf club could be limited 
at december   there were approximately  vacation interval owners who pay dues to silverleaf club and approximately vacation interval owners who pay dues to orlando breeze resort club 
if we develop new resorts outside of florida  their respective clubs are expected to be added to the silverleaf club management agreement 
other operations operation of amenities 
we own  operate  and receive the revenues from the marina at the villages  the golf course and pro shop at holiday hills  and the golf course and pro shop at apple mountain 
although we own the golf course at holly lake  a homeowners association in the development operates the golf course 
in general  silverleaf club receives revenues from the various amenities that require a usage fee  such as watercraft rentals  horseback rides  and restaurants 
samplers 
revenues related to sampler contracts  which entitle the prospective owner to sample a resort during certain periods  have been and will continue to be deferred until the customer uses the stay or allows the contract to expire 
effective january   sampler sales and related costs are accounted for as incidental operations  whereby incremental costs in excess of incremental revenue are charged to expense as incurred and the operations are presented as a net expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
conversely  incremental revenue in excess of incremental costs is recorded as a reduction of inventory in the consolidated balance sheet 
incremental costs include costs that would not have been incurred had we not sold samplers 
during the year ended december   all sampler sales were recorded as a reduction to sales and marketing expense since direct and incremental costs of sampler sales exceeded incremental sampler sales 
the amount of the reduction to sales and marketing expense for sampler sales in was million 
prior to sfas no 
 sampler sales were reported separately as revenue 
we recognized million and million in revenues from sampler sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
utility services 
at december   we owned the water supply facilities at piney shores  the villages  hill country  holly lake  ozark mountain  holiday hills  timber creek  and fox river resorts 
we also owned the waste water treatment facilities at the villages  piney shores  ozark mountain  holly lake  timber creek  and fox river resorts 
we maintained permits to supply and charge third parties for the water supply facilities at the villages  holly lake  holiday hills  ozark mountain  hill country  piney shores  and timber creek resorts  and the waste water facilities at the ozark mountain  holly lake  piney shores  hill country  and the villages resorts 
in march  all of our utility services assets and liabilities were sold for an aggregate sales price of million  which resulted in a pretax gain of  certain of the purchasers of these utility assets entered into a services agreement to provide uninterrupted water supply and waste water treatment services to the eight timeshare resorts to which the transferred utility assets relate 
the purchasers of these utility assets charge the timeshare resorts the tariffed rate for those utility services that are regulated by the states in which the resorts are located 
for any unregulated utility services  the purchasers of these utility assets charge a rate set in accordance with the ratemaking procedures of the texas commission on environmental quality 
other property 
at december   we owned approximately acres in mississippi  and we are entitled to of any profits from this land 
an affiliate of a director of the company owns a net profits interest in this land 
we subsequently sold approximately acres of this land during the first quarter of for approximately  which resulted in a pretax gain of approximately  since  we owned  acres of undeveloped land near philadelphia  pennsylvania  which we were holding for future development as a timeshare resort 
in  we sold this property for an aggregate sales price of million after related expenses  which resulted in a gain of million 
we also own a acre tract of land in the berkshire mountains of western massachusetts that we are in the initial stages of developing 
we have not yet finalized our future development plans for this site  however  we believe that its proximity to major population centers in the northeastern united states and the year round outdoor recreational attractions in the berkshire region make this property suitable for future development as a timeshare resort

each silverleaf owner has certain exchange privileges through the silverleaf club which may be used on an annual basis to i exchange an interval for a different interval week at the same resort so long as the desired interval is of an equal or lower rating  or ii exchange an interval for the same interval week of equal or lower rating at any other of our existing resorts 
silverleaf owners of getaway resorts can only exchange for an interval in a getaway resort unless they own a presidents or chairmans vacation interval 
these exchange rights are a convenience we provide silverleaf owners as an accommodation to them  and are conditioned upon availability of the desired interval or resort 
approximately  exchanges occurred in silverleaf owners pay an exchange fee of to silverleaf club for each such internal exchange 
exchanges 
we believe that our vacation intervals are made more attractive by our participation in a vacation interval exchange network operated by rci 
at december   the existing resorts except for orlando breeze are registered with rci  and approximately of silverleaf owners participate in rci s exchange network 
membership in rci allows participating silverleaf owners to exchange their occupancy right in a unit in a particular year for an occupancy right at the same time or a different time of the same or lower color rating in another participating resort  based upon availability and the payment of a variable exchange fee 
a member may exchange a vacation interval for an occupancy right in another participating resort by listing the vacation interval as available with the exchange organization and by requesting occupancy at another participating resort  indicating the particular resort or geographic area to which the member desires to travel  the size of the unit desired  and the period during which occupancy is desired 
rci assigns a rating of red  white  or blue to each vacation interval for participating resorts based upon a number of factors  including the location and size of the unit  the quality of the resort  and the period during which the vacation interval is available  and attempts to satisfy exchange requests by providing an occupancy right in another vacation interval with a similar rating 
for example  an owner of a red vacation interval may exchange his interval for a red  white  or blue interval 
an owner of a white vacation interval may exchange only for a white or blue interval  and an owner of a blue interval may exchange only for a blue interval 
at december   rci s designation of our units of red  white  and blue vacation intervals is approximately   and  respectively 
if rci is unable to meet the member s initial request  it suggests alternative resorts based on availability 
the annual membership fees in rci  which are at the option and expense of the owner of the vacation interval  are currently exchange rights with rci require an additional fee of approximately for domestic exchanges and for foreign exchanges 
silverleaf club charges an exchange fee of for each exchange through its internal exchange program 
resorts participating in the exchange networks are required to adhere to certain minimum standards regarding available amenities  safety  security  d cor  unit supplies  maid service  room availability  and overall ambiance 
see risk factors for a description of risks associated with the exchange programs 
orlando breeze is not under contract with rci  however it is under contract with interval international  inc  a competitor of rci 
an owner of a vacation interval at orlando breeze may  for annual membership fees and exchange fees similar to those charged by rci  become a member of the interval international timeshare exchange system 
competition all of our operations are contained within and are in support of a single industry segment the vacation ownership industry and we currently operate in only six geographic areas of the united states 
these geographic areas are texas  missouri  massachusetts  illinois  georgia  and florida 
we encounter significant competition from other timeshare resorts in the markets that we serve 
the timeshare industry is highly fragmented and includes a large number of local and regional resort developers and operators 
however  some of the world s most recognized lodging  hospitality  and entertainment companies  such as marriott international marriott vacation club brands  the walt disney company  hilton hotels corporation  hyatt corporation  and four seasons resorts have entered the industry 
other companies in the timeshare industry  including sunterra corporation sunterra  wyndham worldwide corporation wyndham  through its wyndham vacation resorts formerly fairfield resorts  and worldmark by wyndham formerly trendwest resorts  starwood hotels resorts worldwide inc starwood  ramada vacation suites ramada  and bluegreen corporation bluegreen are  or are subsidiaries of  public companies with enhanced access to capital and other resources that public ownership implies 
wyndham  sunterra  and bluegreen own timeshare resorts in or near branson  missouri  which compete with our holiday hills and ozark mountain resorts  and to a lesser extent with our timber creek resort 
sunterra also owns a resort that is located near and competes with piney shores resort 
additionally  there are a number of public or privately owned and operated timeshare resorts in most states in which we own resorts that compete with the existing resorts 
many competitors also own timeshare resorts in or near orlando  florida where our newest resort  orlando breeze  is located 
however sales of orlando breeze vacation intervals are primarily upgrade and additional week interval sales to our existing customers  with the sales taking place at our other existing resorts 
we do not have a sales office in orlando that directly competes with other resort developers and operators located there 
we believe marriott  disney  hilton  hyatt  and four seasons generally target consumers with higher annual incomes than our target market 
our other competitors target consumers with similar income levels as our target market 
our competitors may possess significantly greater financial  marketing  personnel  and other resources than we do 
we cannot be certain that such competitors will not significantly reduce the price of their vacation intervals or offer greater convenience  services  or amenities than we do 
the american resort development association arda recently published a study entitled state of the vacation timeshare industry  united states study the arda study  which reported sales volume in the united states of billion for  compared to billion in and billion in  equating to a year compound annual growth rate exceeding percent 
the study estimated that million households owned one or more us timeshare intervals or points equivalent at january   representing a percent increase over the amount reported one year earlier  however  there can be no assurance that the existing levels of growth in timeshare demand will continue or that we will not have to compete with larger and better capitalized competitors in future periods for a declining number of potential timeshare purchasers 
while our principal competitors are developers of timeshare resorts  we are also subject to competition from other entities engaged in the commercial lodging business  including condominiums  hotels  and motels  as well as others engaged in the leisure business and  to a lesser extent  from campgrounds  recreational vehicles  tour packages  and second home sales 
a reduction in the product costs associated with any of these competitors  or an increase in the company s costs relative to such competitors costs  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition 
numerous businesses  individuals  and other entities compete with us in seeking properties for acquisition and development of new resorts 
some of these competitors are larger and have greater financial and other resources 
such competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to acquire or may cause us to be unable to acquire suitable properties for the development of new resorts 
governmental regulation general 
our marketing and sales of vacation intervals and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by the federal government and the states and jurisdictions in which the existing resorts are located and in which our vacation intervals are marketed and sold 
on a federal level  the federal trade commission has taken the most active regulatory role through the federal trade commission act  which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or competition in interstate commerce 
other federal legislation to which the company is or may be subject includes the truth in lending act and regulation z  the equal opportunity credit act and regulation b  the interstate land sales full disclosure act  the real estate settlement procedures act  the consumer credit protection act  the telephone consumer protection act  the telemarketing and consumer fraud and abuse prevention act  the fair housing act  the civil rights acts of and  the fair credit reporting act  the fair debt collection act  and the americans with disabilities act 
additionally  as a publicly owned company  we are subject to all federal and state securities laws  including the sarbanes oxley act of in response to certain fraudulent marketing practices in the timeshare industry in the s  various states enacted legislation aimed at curbing such abuses 
certain states in which we operate have adopted specific laws and regulations regarding the marketing and sale of vacation intervals 
the laws of most states require us to file a detailed offering statement and supporting documents with a designated state authority  which describe the company  the project  and our promotion and sale of vacation intervals 
the offering statement must be approved by the appropriate state agency before we may solicit residents of such state 
the laws of certain states require us to deliver an offering statement or disclosure statement  together with certain additional information concerning the terms of the purchase  to prospective purchasers of vacation intervals who are residents of such states  even if the resort is not located in such state 
the laws of missouri generally only require certain disclosures in sales documents for prospective purchasers 
there are also laws in each state where we sell vacation intervals that grant the purchaser the right to cancel a contract of purchase at any time within three to fifteen calendar days following the sale 
we market and sell our vacation intervals to residents of certain states adjacent or proximate to the states where our resorts are located 
many of these neighboring states also regulate the marketing and sale of vacation intervals to their residents 
most states have additional laws which regulate our activities and protect purchasers  such as real estate licensure laws  travel sales licensure laws  anti fraud laws  consumer protection laws  telemarketing laws  prize  gift  and sweepstakes laws  and other related laws 
we do not register all of our resorts in each of the states where we register certain resorts 
most of the states where we currently operate have enacted laws and regulations that limit our ability to market our resorts through telemarketing activities 
these states have enacted do not call lists that permit consumers to block telemarketing activities by registering their telephone numbers for a period of years for a nominal fee 
we purchase these lists from the various states quarterly and do not contact those telephone numbers listed 
additionally  the federal do not call implementation act the dnc act  which was enacted on march   provided for the establishment of a national do not call registry administered by the united states federal trade commission ftc under its telemarketing sales rule tsr and the federal communications commission 
the ftc began enforcement actions in october for violations of the tsr by telemarketers 
violations could result in penalties up to  per violation 
the ftc has reported that approximately million telephone numbers had been registered on the national do not call list registry by the end of since the introduction of state and federal do not call legislation  we have become somewhat more reliant on direct mail solicitations as an alternative to some of the telemarketing techniques we have historically utilized 
existing and future restrictions on telemarketing practices could cause our sales to decline 
we believe we are in material compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to the sales and marketing of vacation intervals in the jurisdictions in which we currently do business 
however  we are normally and currently the subject of a number of consumer complaints and regulatory inquiries generally relating to our marketing or sales practices 
we always attempt to resolve all such complaints or inquiries directly with the consumer or the regulatory authority involved 
we cannot be certain that all of these complaints and inquiries by regulators can be resolved without adverse regulatory actions or other consequences  such as class action lawsuits or rescission offers 
we expect some level of consumer complaints in the ordinary course of business as we aggressively market and sell vacation intervals to households  which may include individuals who may not be financially sophisticated 
we cannot be certain that the costs of resolving consumer complaints  regulatory inquiries  or of qualifying under vacation interval ownership regulations in all jurisdictions in which we conduct sales or wish to conduct sales in the future will not be significant  that we are in material compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations  or that violations of law will not have adverse implications  including negative public relations  potential litigation  and regulatory sanctions 
the expense  negative publicity  and potential sanctions associated with the failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity  or financial condition 
further  we cannot be certain that either the federal government or states having jurisdiction over our business will not adopt additional regulations or take other actions that would adversely affect our results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition 
during the s and continuing through the present  the timeshare industry has been and continues to be afflicted with negative publicity and prosecutorial attention due to  among other things  marketing practices which were widely viewed as deceptive or fraudulent 
among the many timeshare companies which have been the subject of federal  state  and local enforcement actions and investigations in the past were certain of the partnerships and corporations that were merged into the company prior to the merged companies  or individually merged company 
some of the settlements  injunctions  and decrees resulting from litigation and enforcement actions the orders to which certain of the merged companies consented in the s purport to bind all successors and assigns  and accordingly may also be enforceable against the company 
in addition  at that time the company was directly a party to one such order issued in missouri 
no past or present officers  directors  or employees of the company or any merged company were named as subjects or respondents in any of these orders  however  each order purports to bind generically unnamed officers  directors  and employees of certain merged companies 
therefore  certain of these orders may be interpreted to be enforceable against the present officers  directors  and employees of the company even though they were not individually named as subjects of the enforcement actions which resulted in these orders 
these orders require  among other things  that all parties bound by the orders  including the company  refrain from engaging in deceptive sales practices in connection with the offer and sale of vacation intervals 
the requirements of the orders are substantially what applicable state and federal laws and regulations mandate  but the consequence of violating the orders may be that sanctions including possible financial penalties and suspension or loss of licensure may be imposed more summarily and may be harsher than would be the case if the orders did not bind the company 
in addition  the existence of the orders may be viewed negatively by prospective regulators in jurisdictions where the company does not now do business  with attendant risks of increased costs and reduced opportunities 
in early  we were the subject of some consumer complaints that triggered governmental investigations into the company s affairs 
in march  we entered into an assurance of voluntary compliance with the texas attorney general  in which we agreed to make additional disclosure to purchasers of vacation intervals regarding the limited availability of our bonus time program during certain periods 
we paid  for investigatory costs and attorneys fees of the texas attorney general in connection with this matter 
also  in march  we entered into an agreed order the agreed order with the texas real estate commission requiring that we comply with certain aspects of the texas timeshare act  texas real estate license act  and rules of the texas real estate commission  with which we had allegedly been in non compliance until mid the allegations included i our admitted failure to register the missouri destination resorts in texas due to our misunderstanding of the reach of the texas timeshare act  ii payment of referral fees for vacation interval sales  the receipt of which was improper on the part of the recipients  and iii miscellaneous other actions alleged to violate the texas timeshare act  which we denied 
while the agreed order acknowledged that we independently resolved ten consumer complaints referenced in the agreed order  discontinued the practices complained of  and registered the missouri destination resorts during and  the texas real estate commission ordered us to cease these discontinued practices and enhance our disclosure to purchasers of vacation intervals 
in the agreed order  we agreed to make a voluntary donation of  to the state of texas 
the agreed order also directed that we revise our training manual for timeshare salespersons and verification officers 
while the agreed order resolved all of the alleged violations contained in complaints received by the texas real estate commission through december   we have encountered and expect to encounter some level of additional consumer complaints  regulatory scrutiny  and periodic remedial action in the ordinary course of our business 
in this regard  during we renewed our timeshare offering plan in the state of new york  which we inadvertently allowed to lapse in as part of this renewal process  we rescinded approximately  of sales to new york residents that were made in after our timeshare offering plan lapsed 
we have established compliance and supervisory methods in training sales and marketing personnel as to adherence to legal requirements 
with regard to direct mailings  a designated compliance employee reviews all mailings to determine if they comply with applicable state legal requirements 
with regard to telemarketing  our marketing management personnel prepare a script for telemarketers based upon applicable state legal requirements 
all telemarketers receive training that includes  among other things  directions to adhere strictly to the approved script 
telemarketers are also monitored by their supervisors to ensure that they do not deviate from the approved script 
additionally  sales personnel receive training as to such applicable legal requirements 
we have a salaried employee at each sales office who reviews the sales documents prior to closing a sale to review compliance with legal requirements 
periodically  we are notified by regulatory agencies to revise our disclosures to consumers and to remedy other alleged inadequacies regarding the sales and marketing process 
in such cases  we revise our direct mailings  telemarketing scripts  or sales disclosure documents  as appropriate  to comply with such requests 
we have supervisors to monitor compliance with all state and federal do not call regulations 
we are not currently aware of any non compliance with any state or federal statute  rule  or regulation which we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
environmental matters 
under various federal  state  and local environmental laws  ordinances  and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property  and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and tort liability and for investigation and clean up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination 
such laws typically impose clean up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants  and the liability under such laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility 
the cost of investigation  remediation  or removal of such substances may be substantial  and the presence of such substances  or the failure to properly remediate the contamination on such property  may adversely affect the owner s ability to sell such property or to borrow using such property as collateral 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of a release of hazardous or toxic substances at such disposal or treatment facility  whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person 
in addition  some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination 
finally  the owner or operator of a site may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from a site or from environmental regulatory violations 
in connection with our ownership and operation of our properties  we may be potentially liable for such claims 
certain federal  state  and local laws  regulations  and ordinances govern the removal  encapsulation  or disturbance of asbestos containing materials acms when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction  remodeling  renovation  or demolition of a building 
such laws may impose liability for release of acms and may provide for third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with acms 
in connection with our ownership and operation of our properties  we may be potentially liable for such costs 
in  we conducted a limited asbestos survey at each of our existing resorts  which surveys did not reveal material potential losses associated with acms at certain of the existing resorts 
in addition  recent studies have linked radon  a naturally occurring substance  to increased risks of lung cancer 
while there are currently no state or federal requirements regarding the monitoring for  presence of  or exposure to radon in indoor air  the epa and the surgeon general recommend testing residences for the presence of radon in indoor air  and the epa further recommends that concentrations of radon in indoor air be limited to less than picocuries per liter of air pci l the recommended action level 
the presence of radon in concentrations equal to or greater than the recommended action level in one or more of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell vacation intervals at such properties and the market value of such property 
we have not tested our properties for radon 
recently enacted federal legislation will eventually require us to disclose to potential purchasers of vacation intervals at our resorts that were constructed prior to any known lead paint hazards and will impose treble damages for failure to so notify 
electric transmission lines are located in the vicinity of some of our properties 
electric transmission lines are one of many sources of electromagnetic fields emfs to which people may be exposed 
research into potential health impacts associated with exposure to emfs has produced inconclusive results 
notwithstanding the lack of conclusive scientific evidence  some states now regulate the strength of electric and magnetic fields emanating from electric transmission lines  while others have required transmission facilities to measure for levels of emfs 
in addition  we understand that lawsuits have  on occasion  been filed primarily against electric utilities alleging personal injuries resulting from exposure as well as fear of adverse health effects 
in addition  fear of adverse health effects from transmission lines has been a factor considered in determining property value in obtaining financing and in condemnation and eminent domain proceedings brought by power companies seeking to construct transmission lines 
therefore  there is a potential for the value of a property to be adversely affected as a result of its proximity to a transmission line and for the company to be exposed to damage claims by persons exposed to emfs 
we conducted phase i environmental assessments at each of our resorts during or later  in order to identify potential environmental concerns 
these phase i assessments were carried out in accordance with accepted industry practices and consisted of non invasive investigations of environmental conditions at the properties  including a preliminary investigation of the sites and identification of publicly known conditions concerning properties in the vicinity of the sites  physical site inspections  review of aerial photographs and relevant governmental records where readily available  interviews with knowledgeable parties  investigation for the presence of above ground and underground storage tanks presently or formerly at the sites  and the preparation and issuance of written reports 
our phase i assessments of the properties did not reveal any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business  assets  or results of operations taken as a whole  nor are we aware of any such material environmental liability 
nevertheless  it is possible that our phase i assessments did not reveal all environmental liabilities or that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware 
moreover  there can be no assurance that i future laws  ordinances  or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or ii the current environmental condition of the properties will not be affected by the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of the properties such as the presence of underground storage tanks or by third parties unrelated to us 
we do not believe that compliance with applicable environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity  or financial condition 
we believe that our properties are in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state  and local laws  ordinances  and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances 
we have not been notified by any governmental authority or any third party  and are not otherwise aware  of any material noncompliance  liability  or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our present properties 
utility regulation 
at december   we owned the water supply and waste water treatment facilities at several of the existing resorts  which are regulated by various governmental agencies 
the texas natural resource conservation commission is the primary state umbrella agency regulating utilities at the resorts in texas  and the missouri department of natural resources and public service commission of missouri are the primary state umbrella agencies regulating utilities at the resorts in missouri 
the environmental protection agency  division of water pollution control  and the illinois commerce commission are the primary state agencies regulating water utilities in illinois 
these agencies regulate the rates and charges for the services allowing a reasonable rate of return in relation to invested capital and other factors  the size and quality of the plants  the quality of water supplied  the efficacy of waste water treatment  and many other aspects of the utilities operations 
the agencies have approval rights regarding the entity owning the utilities including its financial strength and the right to approve a transfer of the applicable permits upon any change in control of the entity holding the permits 
other federal  state  regional  and local environmental  health  and other agencies also regulate various aspects of the provision of water and waste water treatment services 
in march  all of our utility services assets and liabilities were sold for an aggregate sales price of million  which resulted in a pretax gain of  other regulation 
under various state and federal laws governing housing and places of public accommodation  we are required to meet certain requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
although we believe that our facilities are generally in compliance with present requirements of such laws  we are aware of certain of our properties that are not in full compliance with all aspects of such laws 
we are presently responding  and expect to respond in the future  to inquiries  claims  and concerns from consumers and regulators regarding our compliance with existing state and federal regulations affording the disabled access to housing and accommodations 
it is our practice to respond positively to all such inquiries  claims and concerns and to work with regulators and consumers to resolve all issues arising under existing regulations concerning access and use of our properties by disabled persons 
we believe that we will incur additional costs of compliance and or remediation in the future with regard to the requirements of such existing regulations 
future legislation may also impose new or further burdens or restrictions on owners of timeshare resort properties with respect to access by the disabled 
the ultimate cost of compliance with such legislation and or remediation of conditions found to be non compliant is not currently ascertainable  and while such costs are not expected to have a material effect on our business  such costs could be substantial 
limitations or restrictions on the completion of certain renovations may limit application of our growth strategy in certain instances or reduce profit margins on our operations 
we are also subject to a variety of local  state  and federal laws and regulations concerning health and sanitation  facility operations  fire safety and occupational safety 
employees at december   we had  full and part time employees and the clubs collectively had full and part time employees 
our employee relations are good  both at the company and at the clubs 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union and we are not aware of any union organization efforts with respect to any of our employees 
insurance we carry comprehensive liability  fire  hurricane  and storm insurance with respect to our resorts  with policy specifications  insured limits  and deductibles customarily carried for similar properties  which we believe are adequate 
there are  however  certain types of losses such as losses arising from floods and acts of war that are not generally insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose the capital invested in a resort  as well as the anticipated future revenues from such resort  and would continue to be obligated on any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property 
any such loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity  or financial condition 
we self insure for employee medical claims reduced by certain stop loss provisions 
we also self insure for property damage to certain vehicles and heavy equipment 
description of our indebtedness and senior credit facilities at december  existing indebtedness

the timeshare receivables we sold to sf iii are without recourse to us  except for breaches of certain representations and warranties at the time of sale 
we are responsible for servicing the timeshare receivables purchased by sf iii pursuant to the terms of the indenture and will receive a fee for our services 
such fees received approximate our internal cost of servicing such receivables  and approximates the fee a third party would receive to service such receivables

financial covenants under senior credit facilities 
the company s senior credit facilities discussed above provide certain financial covenants that we must satisfy 
any failure to comply with the financial covenants in any single loan agreement will result in a cross default under the various facilities 
the financial covenants as they exist at december  are described below 
tangible net worth covenant 
each of our senior lenders has a somewhat different requirement  the most restrictive being that we must maintain a tangible net worth at all times greater than the tangible net worth as of december   or million  plus of the aggregate amount of consolidated net income after december  tangible net worth is i the consolidated net worth of the company and our consolidated subsidiaries  plus ii to the extent not otherwise included in the such consolidated net worth  unsecured subordinated indebtedness of the company and our consolidated subsidiaries the terms and conditions of which are reasonably satisfactory to the required banks  minus iii the consolidated intangibles of the company and our consolidated subsidiaries  including  without limitation  goodwill  trademarks  trade names  copyrights  patents  patent applications  licenses and rights in any of the foregoing and other items treated as intangibles in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
consolidated net income is the consolidated net income of the company and our subsidiaries  after deduction of all expenses  taxes  and other proper charges but excluding any extraordinary profits or losses  determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
marketing and sales expenses covenant 
our ratio of marketing expenses to vacation interval sales for the latest rolling months then ended must not equal or exceed as of the last day of any fiscal quarter 
two senior lenders have increased the ratio we are required to stay below to as of the last day of each fiscal quarter 
minimum loan delinquency covenant 
our over day delinquency rate on our entire consumer loan portfolio may not be greater than as of the last day of each fiscal quarter 
debt service covenant 
our ratio of i earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda less capital expenditures as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to ii the interest expense minus all non cash items constituting interest expense for such period  for the latest rolling months then ending must not be less than to as of the last day of each fiscal quarter 
profitable operations covenant 
our consolidated net income i for any fiscal year must not be less than  ii for any two consecutive fiscal quarters reviewed on an individual rather than on an aggregate basis must not be less than  and iii for any rolling month period must not be less than 
leverage ratio covenant 
our ratio of debt to tangible net worth must not exceed to at any time during the term of the loans 
fico score covenant 
our weighted average fico credit bureau score for all sales to silverleaf owners with respect to which a fico score can be obtained must not be less than for any fiscal calendar quarter 
our credit facilities also contain covenants including requirements that we i preserve and maintain the collateral securing the loans  ii pay all taxes and other obligations relating to the collateral  and iii refrain from selling or transferring the collateral or permitting any encumbrances on the collateral 
the credit agreements also contain restrictive covenants which include i restrictions on liens against and dispositions of collateral  ii restrictions on distributions to affiliates and prepayments of loans from affiliates  iii restrictions on changes in control and management of the company  iv restrictions on sales of substantially all of the assets of the company  and v restrictions on mergers  consolidations  or other reorganizations of the company 
under certain credit facilities  a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the company  a merger  consolidation  or reorganization of the company  or other changes of control of the ownership of the company  would constitute an event of default and permit the senior lenders to accelerate the maturity of the facility 
as of december  and all periods thereafter  we have been in full compliance with our debt covenants in our credit facilities with all of our senior lenders 
termination of silverleaf finance i facility during the fourth quarter of  our qualified special purpose entity  sf i  entered into a loan and security agreement with autobahn funding company llc autobahn  as lender  dz bank  as agent  and other parties 
we serviced receivables that we sold to sf i under a separate agreement 
sf i pledged the receivables it purchased from us as collateral for funds borrowed from autobahn 
the facility began with a maximum borrowing capacity of million and a scheduled maturity of october it was subsequently extended to revolve through march with a final maximum borrowing capacity of million 
we dissolved sf i simultaneously with the sale of our timeshare receivables to sf iii during the third quarter of item a 
risk factors if our assumptions and estimates in our business model are wrong  our future results could be negatively impacted 
the financial covenants in our credit facilities are based upon a business model prepared by our management 
we used a number of assumptions and estimates in preparing the business model  including we estimated that we will sell our existing and planned inventory of vacation intervals within years  we assumed that our level of sales and operating profits and costs can be maintained and will grow in future periods  we assumed the availability of credit facilities necessary to sustain our operations and anticipated growth  and we assumed that we can raise the prices on our products and services as market conditions allow 
these assumptions and estimates are subject to significant business  economic and competitive risks and uncertainties 
if our assumptions and estimates are wrong  our future financial condition and results of operations may vary significantly from those projected in the business model 
neither our past nor present independent auditors have reviewed or expressed an opinion about our business model or our ability to achieve it 
changes in the timeshare industry could affect our operations 
we operate principally within the timeshare industry 
our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected by any of the following events an oversupply of timeshare units  a reduction in demand for timeshare units  changes in travel and vacation patterns  a decrease in popularity of our resorts with our consumers  governmental regulations or taxation of the timeshare industry  and negative publicity about the timeshare industry 
we may be impacted by general economic conditions 
our customers may be more vulnerable to deteriorating economic conditions than consumers in the luxury or upscale timeshare markets 
an economic slowdown in the united states could depress consumer spending for vacation intervals 
additionally  significant increases in the cost of transportation may limit the number of potential customers who travel to our resorts for a sales presentation 
during an economic slowdown we could experience increased delinquencies in the payment of vacation interval promissory notes and monthly club dues 
we are at risk for defaults by our customers 
we offer financing to the buyers of vacation intervals at our resorts 
notes receivable from timeshare buyers constitute one of our principal assets 
these buyers make down payments of at least of the purchase price and deliver promissory notes to us for the balances 
the promissory notes generally bear interest at a fixed rate  are payable over a seven year to ten year period  and are secured by a first mortgage on the vacation interval 
we bear the risk of defaults on these promissory notes 
although we prescreen prospects by credit scoring them in the early stages of the marketing and sales process  we generally do not perform a detailed credit history review of our customers  as is the case with most other timeshare developers 
we recorded of the purchase price of vacation intervals as estimated uncollectible revenue for the year ended december   which resulted in a decrease in our sales revenue of million for the year  in accordance with sfas which we adopted effective january  when a buyer of a vacation interval defaults  we foreclose on the vacation interval and attempt to resell it 
the associated marketing  selling  and administrative costs from the original sale are not recovered  and we will incur such costs again when we resell the vacation interval 
although we may have recourse against a vacation interval buyer for the unpaid price  certain states have laws that limit our ability to recover personal judgments against customers who have defaulted on their loans 
for example  if we were to file a lawsuit to collect the balance owed to us by a customer in texas where approximately of vacation interval sales took place in  the customer could file a court proceeding to determine the fair market value of the property foreclosed upon 
in such event  we may not recover a personal judgment against the customer for the full amount of the deficiency 
we would only recover an amount that the indebtedness owed to us exceeds the fair market value of the property 
accordingly  we have generally not pursued this remedy 
at december   we had vacation interval customer notes receivable in the approximate principal amount of million  and had an allowance for uncollectible notes of approximately million 
we cannot be certain that this allowance is adequate 
we must borrow funds to finance our operations 
our business is dependent on our ability to finance customer notes receivable through our banks 
at december   we either directly or through our fully consolidated finance subsidiaries owed approximately million of principal to our senior lenders 
borrowing base 
we have receivable based loan agreements with senior lenders to borrow up to approximately million 
we pledged our customer promissory notes and mortgages as security under these agreements 
our senior lenders typically lend us to of the principal amount of our customers notes  and payments from silverleaf owners on such notes are credited directly to the senior lender and applied against our loan balance 
at december   we had a portfolio of approximately  vacation interval customer notes receivable in the approximate principal amount of million 
approximately million in principal amount of our customers notes were days or more past due and  therefore  ineligible as collateral 
the amount of customer notes receivable eligible as collateral in the future may not be sufficient to support the borrowings we may require for our liquidity and continued growth 
negative cash flow 
we ordinarily receive only to of the purchase price as a down payment on the sale of a vacation interval  but we must pay in full the costs of development  marketing  and sale of the interval 
maximum borrowings available under our credit facilities may not be sufficient to cover these costs  thereby straining our capital resources  liquidity  and capacity to grow 
interest rate mismatch 
at december   our portfolio of customer loans had a weighted average fixed interest rate of 
at such date  our borrowings which bear interest predominantly at variable rates against the portfolio had a weighted average cost of funds of 
we have historically derived net interest income from our operating activities because the interest rates we charge our customers who finance the purchase of their vacation intervals exceed the interest rates we pay to our senior lenders 
because of our existing indebtedness currently bears interest at variable rates and our customer notes receivable bear interest at fixed rates  increases in interest rates charged by our senior lenders would erode the spread in interest rates that we have historically enjoyed and could cause the interest expense on our borrowings to exceed our interest income on our portfolio of customer notes receivable 
therefore  any increase in interest rates  particularly if sustained  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition 
to the extent interest rates decrease on loans available to our customers  we face an increased risk that customers will pre pay their loans  which would reduce our income from operating activities 
to partially offset an increase in interest rates  we have engaged in two interest rate hedging transactions  or derivatives  related to our conduit loan with silverleaf finance ii  inc  a delaware corporation  for a notional amount of million at december   that expires between september and march our vfn with sf iv also acts as an interest rate hedge since it contains a provision for an interest rate cap  however there are no amounts outstanding under this line of credit at december  in addition  the series a notes related to our off balance sheet special purpose finance subsidiary  sf iii  with a balance of million at december   bear interest at a blended fixed rate of  and our series a notes related to sf v bear interest at a blended fixed rate of 
maturity mismatch 
we typically provide financing to our customers over a seven year to ten year period 
our customer notes had an average maturity of years at december  our senior credit facilities have scheduled maturity dates between april and july additionally  should our revolving credit facilities be declared in default  the amount outstanding could be declared to be immediately due and payable 
accordingly  there could be a mismatch between our anticipated cash receipts and cash disbursements in and subsequent periods 
although we have historically been able to secure financing sufficient to fund our operations  we do not presently have agreements with our senior lenders to extend the term of our existing funding commitments beyond their scheduled maturity dates or to replace such commitments upon their expiration  with the exception of our debt with textron financial corporation  noted directly below 
if we are unable to refinance our existing loans  we could be required to sell our portfolio of customer notes receivable  probably at a substantial discount  or to seek other alternatives to enable us to continue in business 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain required financing in the future 
in the first quarter of  we consolidated our debt with textron financial corporation into one revolving loan 
as a result of the amended and restated loan and security agreement  the funding period on the consolidated debt has been extended from june to january  with revised maturity dates of january  for the receivables component and january  on both the acquisition and inventory components 
in addition  the interest rates previously charged have been reduced 
this transaction is described in more detail under the heading subsequent events in note to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f impact on sales 
limitations on the availability of financing would inhibit sales of vacation intervals due to i the lack of funds to finance the initial negative cash flow that results from sales that we finance and ii reduced demand if we are unable to provide financing to purchasers of vacation intervals 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing 
several unpredictable factors may cause our adjusted ebitda to be insufficient to meet debt service requirements or satisfy financial covenants 
we incurred net losses in one of the past five years 
should we record net losses in future periods  our cash flow and our ability to obtain additional financing could be materially and adversely impacted 
many of the factors that will determine whether or not we generate sufficient ebitda to meet current or future debt service requirements and satisfy financial covenants are inherently difficult to predict 
these factors include the number of sales of vacation intervals  the average purchase price per interval  the number of customer defaults  our cost of borrowing  our sales and marketing costs and other operating expenses  and the continued sale of notes receivable 
our current and planned expenses and debt repayment levels are and will be to a large extent fixed in the short term  and are based in part on past expectations as to future revenues and cash flows 
we may be unable to reduce spending in a timely manner to compensate for any past or future revenue or cash flow shortfall 
it is possible that our revenue  cash flow or operating results may not meet the expectations of our business model  and may even result in our being unable to meet the debt repayment schedules or financial covenants contained in the various agreements which evidence our indebtedness 
our leverage is significant and may impair our ability to obtain additional financing  reduce the amount of cash available for operations  and make us more vulnerable to financial downturns 
our agreements with our various lenders may require a substantial portion of our cash flow to be used to pay interest expense and principal  impair our ability to obtain on acceptable terms  if at all  additional financing that might be necessary for working capital  capital expenditures or other purposes  and limit our ability to further refinance or amend the terms of our existing debt obligations  if necessary or advisable 
we may not be able to manage our financial leverage as we intend  and we may not be able to achieve an appropriate balance between the rate of growth which we consider acceptable and future reductions in financial leverage 
if we are not able to achieve growth in adjusted ebitda  we may not be able to refinance our existing debt obligations and we may be precluded from incurring additional indebtedness due to cash flow coverage requirements under existing or future debt instruments 
our business is highly regulated 
we are subject to substantial governmental regulation in the conduct of our business 
see item business governmental regulation  environmental matters  utility regulation  other regulation  and item legal proceedings 
if we are found to have violated any statute  rule  or regulation applicable to us  our assets  or our business  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition 
we are dependent on our key personnel 
the loss of the services of the key members of management or our inability to hire when needed  retain  and integrate needed new or replacement management and employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition in future periods 
we will incur costs at our resorts for additional development and construction activities 
we intend to continue to develop our existing resorts 
we also intend to acquire or develop additional timeshare resorts  however  continued development of our resorts places substantial demands on our liquidity and capital resources  as well as on our personnel and administrative capabilities 
risks associated with our development and construction activities include construction costs or delays at a property may exceed original estimates which could make the development uneconomical or unprofitable  sales of vacation intervals at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable  and financing may not be available on favorable terms for development of or the continued sales of vacation intervals at a property 
we cannot be certain that we will have the liquidity and capital resources to develop and expand our resorts as we presently intend 
our development and construction activities  as well as our ownership and management of real estate  are subject to comprehensive federal  state  and local laws regulating such matters as environmental and health concerns  protection of endangered species  water supplies  zoning  land development  land use  building design and construction  marketing and sales  and other matters 
our failure to maintain the requisite licenses  permits  allocations  authorizations  and other entitlements pursuant to such laws could impact the development  completion  and sale of vacation intervals at our resorts 
the enactment of slow growth or no growth initiatives or changes in labor or other laws in any area where our resorts are located could also delay  affect the cost or feasibility of  or preclude entirely the expansion planned at one or more of our resorts 
most of our resorts are located in rustic areas  which in the past have often required us to provide public utility water and sanitation services in order to proceed with development 
this development is subject to permission and regulation by governmental agencies  the denial or conditioning of which could limit or preclude development 
although we are not currently operating any such utilities  if future development requires that we do  we would be subject to risk of liability in connection with both the quality of fresh water provided and the treatment and discharge of waste water 
in march  we sold the water distribution and waste water treatment utilities assets at eight of our resorts located in texas  illinois and missouri 
the purchasers of those assets entered into separate services agreements to provide uninterrupted water supply and waste water treatment services to the eight resorts and to maintain the utilities assets 
the purchasers have also agreed to provide sufficient future capital additions at each resort as will be required to provide at least the same level of utility services to the resort as is currently provided 
failure by the purchasers of these utility assets to supply service to the resorts or to adequately maintain and expand when required the water distribution and waste water treatment utilities assets could impact our ability to provide the utilities necessary to operate the resorts or to expand them  either of which could have a material effect on our results of operation 
we must incur costs to comply with laws governing accessibility of facilities to disabled persons 
we are subject to a number of state and federal laws  including the fair housing act and the americans with disabilities act the ada  that impose requirements related to access and use by disabled persons of a variety of public accommodations and facilities 
the ada requirements did not become effective until after january  although we believe our existing resorts are substantially in compliance with these laws  we will incur additional costs to fully comply with these laws 
additional federal  state  and local legislation may impose further restrictions or requirements on us with respect to access by disabled persons 
the ultimate cost of compliance with such legislation is not currently known  however such costs are not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition 
we may be vulnerable to regional conditions 
our performance and the value of our properties are affected by regional factors  including local economic conditions which may be adversely impacted by business layoffs or downsizing  industry slowdowns  changing demographics  and other factors and the local regulatory climate 
our current geographic concentration could make us more susceptible to adverse events or conditions that affect these areas in particular 
at december   of our owners lived in texas  lived in illinois  lived in massachusetts  and lived in missouri 
our remaining customer base lives primarily in other states within the united states of america 
we may be liable for environmental claims 
under various federal  state  and local laws  ordinances  and regulations  as well as common law  the owner or operator of real property generally is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on  in  or emanating from  such property  as well as related costs of investigation and property damage 
such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances 
the presence of such substances  or the failure to properly remediate such substances  may adversely affect the owner s ability to sell or lease a property or to borrow money using such real property as collateral 
other federal and state laws require the removal or encapsulation of asbestos containing material when such material is in poor condition or in the event of construction  demolition  remodeling  or renovation 
other statutes may require the removal of underground storage tanks 
noncompliance with these and other environmental  health  or safety requirements may result in the need to cease or alter operations at a property 
further  the owner or operator of a site may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from violations of environmental regulations or from contamination associated with the site 
phase i environmental reports which typically involve inspection without soil sampling or ground water analysis were prepared in or later by independent environmental consultants for all of the existing resorts 
the reports did not reveal  nor are we aware of  any environmental liability that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity  or financial condition 
we cannot be certain that the phase i reports revealed all environmental liabilities or that no prior owner created any material environmental condition not known to us 
certain environmental laws impose liability on a previous owner of property to the extent hazardous or toxic substances were present during the prior ownership period 
a transfer of the property may not relieve an owner of such liability 
thus  we may have liability with respect to properties previously sold by us or by our predecessors 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state  and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances 
we have not been notified by any governmental authority or third party of any non compliance  liability  or other claim in connection with any of our present or former properties 
our sales could decline if our resorts do not qualify for participation in an exchange network 
the attractiveness of vacation interval ownership is enhanced by the availability of exchange networks that allow silverleaf owners to exchange in a particular year the occupancy right in their vacation interval for an occupancy right in another participating network resort 
according to arda  the ability to exchange vacation intervals was cited by many buyers as an important reason for purchasing a vacation interval 
several companies  including rci  provide broad based vacation interval exchange services  and as of december   the existing resorts are qualified for participation in the rci exchange network except for orlando breeze  which is qualified through interval international  a competitor of rci 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to qualify the existing resorts or any future resorts for participation in these networks or any other exchange network 
if such exchange networks cease to function effectively  or if our resorts are not accepted as exchanges for other desirable resorts  our sales of vacation intervals could decline 
our sales would be affected by a secondary market for vacation intervals 
we believe the market for resale of vacation intervals is very limited and that resale prices are substantially below the original purchase price of a vacation interval 
this may make ownership of vacation intervals less attractive to prospective buyers 
owners of vacation intervals who wish to sell their vacation interval compete with our sales 
vacation interval resale clearing houses and brokers  including internet based clearinghouses  do not currently have a material impact on our sales 
however  if the secondary market for vacation intervals becomes more organized and liquid  whether through internet based clearinghouses and brokers or other means  the availability of resale intervals at lower prices could materially adversely affect our prices and our ability to sell new vacation intervals 
our sales are seasonal in nature 
our sales of vacation intervals have generally been lower in the months of november and december 
cash flow and earnings may be impacted by the timing of development  the completion of future resorts  and the potential impact of weather or other conditions in the regions where we operate 
our operating results could be negatively impacted by these factors 
we are not insured for certain types of losses 
we do not insure certain types of losses such as losses arising from floods and acts of war either because insurance is unavailable or unaffordable 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could be required to repair damage at our expense or lose our capital invested in a resort  as well as the anticipated future revenues from such resort 
we would continue to be obligated on any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property 
our results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition could be adversely affected by such losses 
we will continue to be leveraged 
our ability to finance customer notes receivable and develop our resorts is dependent upon borrowed funds  which would be collateralized by certain of our assets 
in addition  our loan agreements contain financial covenants that must be complied with in order to continue to borrow additional funds 
failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition 
future loan agreements would likely contain similar restrictions 
the indentures pertaining to our and senior subordinated notes permit us to incur certain additional indebtedness  including indebtedness secured by our customer notes receivable 
accordingly  to the extent our customer notes receivable increase and we have sufficient credit facilities available  we may be able to borrow additional funds 
the indentures pertaining to our and senior subordinated notes also permit us to borrow additional funds in order to finance development of our resorts 
future construction loans will likely result in liens against the respective properties 
common stock could be impacted by our indebtedness 
the level of our indebtedness could negatively impact holders of our common stock  because a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness  our ability to obtain additional debt financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or acquisitions may be limited  our level of indebtedness could limit our flexibility in reacting to changes in the industry and economic conditions generally  negative covenants in our loan agreements may limit our management s ability to operate our business in the best interests of our shareholders  some of our loans are at variable rates of interest  and a substantial increase in interest rates could adversely affect our ability to meet debt service obligations  and increased interest expense will reduce earnings  if any 
we could lose the right to manage the clubs 
each existing resort has a club that operates through a centralized organization called silverleaf club  to manage most of our existing resorts on a collective basis  except for orlando breeze  which has its own club 
the consolidation of operations at most of our existing resorts through silverleaf club permits a centralized reservation system for all resorts  substantial cost savings by purchasing goods and services for all resorts on a group basis  which generally results in a lower cost of goods and services than if such goods and services were purchased by each resort on an individual basis  centralized management for the entire resort system  centralized legal  accounting  and administrative services for the entire resort system  and uniform implementation of various rules and regulations governing all resorts 
we currently have the right to unilaterally appoint the board of directors or governors of the clubs until the respective control periods have expired typically triggered by the cessation of sales of the planned development  unless otherwise provided by the bylaws of the association or under applicable law 
thereafter  the bylaws of certain of the clubs require that a majority of the members of the board of directors or governors of those clubs be owners of vacation intervals of those resorts 
the loss of control of the board of directors or governors of the clubs could result in our being unable to unilaterally cause the renewal of the management agreement with the silverleaf club when it expires in this could result in a loss of revenue and have other materially adverse effects on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
we could issue preferred stock that would have rights and preferences senior to common stock 
our articles of incorporation authorize the board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to establish the preferences and rights including the right to vote and the right to convert into common stock of any series of preferred stock issued 
such preferences and rights would likely grant to the holders of the preferred stock certain preferences in right of payment upon a dissolution of the company and the liquidation of our assets that would not be available to the holders of our common stock 
to the extent that our credit facilities would permit  the board could also establish a dividend payable to the holders of the preferred stock that would not be available to the holders of the common stock 
our cash flow may not be adequate upon an acceleration of deferred taxes 
while we report sales of vacation intervals as income for financial reporting purposes at the time of the sale after receiving a to down payment  for federal income tax purposes  we report substantially all vacation interval sales on the installment method 
under the installment method  we recognize income for regular federal income tax purposes on the sale of vacation intervals when cash is received in the form of a down payment and as payments on customer loans are received 
our liability for deferred taxes ie  taxes owed to taxing authorities in the future in consequence of income previously reported in the financial statements was million at december   primarily attributable to this method of reporting vacation interval sales  before utilization of any available deferred tax benefits up to million at december   including net operating loss carryforwards  limitations on the use of which are discussed below 
these amounts do not include accrued interest on the deferred taxes  which will be payable if the deferred taxes become payable  the amount of which is not now reasonably ascertainable 
if we should sell the installment notes or be required to factor them or if the notes were foreclosed on by one of our senior lenders or otherwise disposed of  the deferred gain would be reportable for regular federal tax purposes and the deferred taxes  including interest on the taxes for the period the taxes were deferred  as computed under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  would become due 
we cannot be certain that we would have sufficient cash resources to pay those taxes and interest nor can we be certain how the payment of such taxes may affect our operational liquidity needs 
furthermore  if our sales of vacation intervals should decrease in the future  our diminished operations may not generate either sufficient tax losses to offset taxable income or funds to pay the deferred tax liability from prior periods 
we will be subject to alternative minimum taxes 
for purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax amt imposed under section of the code on our alternative minimum taxable income amti  the installment sale method is generally not allowed 
the code requires an adjustment to our amti for a portion of our adjusted current earnings ace 
our ace must be computed without application of the installment sale method 
accordingly  we anticipate that we will pay significant amt in future years 
section of the code does provide that we will be allowed a credit minimum tax credit against our regular federal income tax liability for all or a portion of any amt previously paid 
due to losses incurred in and  we received refunds of amt totaling million during and million during as a result of the carryback of our and amt losses to   and for  we estimate our amt liability is approximately million  with the result that we will have total amt credit carryforwards of approximately million as of december  due to the exchange offer described under the next heading  an ownership change  within the meaning of section g of the code occurred 
under section  the amount of the excess credits which exist as of the date of an ownership change can be used to offset tax liability for post change years only to the extent of the section credit limitation  which amount is defined as the tax liability which is attributable to so much of the taxable income as does not exceed the section limitation for such post change year to the extent available after the application of various adjustments 
as a result of the above described refunds of previously paid amt  there is no minimum tax credit that is subject to section of the code as a result of our ownership change 
if it is subsequently determined that we have an amt liability for prior years  and thus a minimum tax credit as of the time of the exchange offer  or if additional ownership changes within the meaning of section g of the code occur in the future  we cannot be certain that such ownership changes will not result in a limitation on the use of any such minimum tax credit 
see the discussion under the next heading regarding possible future ownership changes 
our use of net operating loss carryforwards could be limited by an ownership change 
we had net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million at december   for regular federal income tax purposes  related primarily to the immediate deduction of expenses and the simultaneous deferral of installment sale gains 
in addition to the general limitations on the carryback and carryforward of nols under section of the code  section of the code imposes additional limitations on the utilization of nols by a corporation following various types of ownership changes which result in more than a percentage point change in ownership of a corporation within a three year period 
our completion in of our exchange offer with certain holders of our senior subordinated notes resulted in an ownership change within section g as of may  the change date 
as a result  the future utilization of approximately million of our nol as of december   is subject to limitation for regular federal income tax purposes 
there is an annual limitation of approximately  which was the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change  multiplied by the applicable long term tax exempt rate 
however  that annual limitation may be increased for any recognized built in gain  which existed as of the change date to the extent allowed in section of the code 
we believe that the built in gain associated with the installment sale gains as of the change date increases the annual limitation and will allow the utilization of most of the million portion of our nol as needed 
nevertheless  we cannot be certain that the limitations of section will not limit or deny our future utilization of the million portion of our nol 
such limitation or denial could require us to pay substantial additional federal and state taxes and interest 
moreover  we cannot be certain that future ownership changes will not limit or deny our future utilization of all of our nol 
the more than percentage point test for a change in ownership is based on a three year lookback and will be determined for the three years commencing may   by including the  shares sold by two of our principal shareholders on that date  which resulted in an approximately percentage point change in ownership based on the shares outstanding on that date 
therefore  that change in ownership  when combined with other changes before and after that date  could result in another more than percentage point change in ownership in the future 
if we cannot utilize our nol  we will be required to pay substantial additional federal and state taxes and interest 
such tax and interest liabilities may adversely affect our liquidity 
we could be liable for back payroll taxes if our independent contractors are reclassified as employees 
although we treat all on site sales personnel as employees for payroll tax purposes  we do have independent contractor agreements with certain sales and marketing persons or entities 
we have not treated these independent contractors as employees and do not withhold payroll taxes from the amounts paid to such persons or entities 
in the event the internal revenue service or any state or local taxing authority were to successfully classify such persons or entities as employees  rather than as independent contractors  we could be liable for back payroll taxes 
this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
we could be negatively impacted by national and state do not call lists 
we rely heavily on telemarketing activities to arrange tours of our resorts to potential customers 
on july   the federal communications commission fcc released new rules and regulations promulgated under the telephone consumer protection act of  which could have a negative impact on our telemarketing activities 
the fcc has implemented  in conjunction with the federal trade commission ftc  a national do not call registry  which applies to both interstate and intrastate commercial telemarketing calls 
the ftc has reported that approximately million telephone numbers had been registered on the national do not call registry by the end of this could sharply limit the number of contacts we will be able to make through our telemarketing activities 
we will continue to telemarket to individuals who do not place their telephone numbers on a do not call list and those with whom we have an established business relationship 
our use of autodialers to call potential customers in our database could also be restricted by new call abandonment standards specified in the fcc rules and regulations 
we cannot currently determine the impact that these new regulations could have on our sales  however  the large number of telephone numbers registered on the national do not call registry and the restrictions on our use of autodialers could negatively affect our sales and marketing efforts and require us to use less effective  more expensive alternative marketing methods 
the new rules became effective on october  and we have experienced a decline in the number of telemarketing calls we are able to complete as a result of the changes in the rules relating to the use of automatic dialers 
all companies involved in telemarketing expect some negative impact to their businesses as a result of the do not call rules and other federal and state legislation  which seeks to protect the privacy of consumers from various types of marketing solicitations 
because of our historical dependence on telemarketing  we believe that these changes in the law will continue to have a material impact on our operations and will require us to modify our historical marketing practices in order to both remain compliant with the law and to achieve the levels of resort tours by consumers which are necessary for our profitable operation 
we will continue to assess both the rules impact on operations and alternative methods of marketing  such as direct mail  that are not impacted by the new rules 
in addition to the national do not call list  various states have implemented do not call legislation that also may affect our business 
the substantially increased costs of our compliance with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  including the requirements of section  may adversely affect our available cash  our management team s attention to our core business  and the price of our stock 
we are not yet required to fully comply with the internal control reporting provisions of of the sarbanes oxley act of  and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the sec to implement unless extended further by the sec  companies of our size ie  non accelerated filers are required to be in full compliance with for fiscal years ending on or after july  if we become subject to  we will be required to furnish a report by our management to include in our annual report on form k regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
the report would include  among other things  an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
section would also require our auditors to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control 
in an effort to be prepared to comply with the requirements of  we have taken steps over the last several years to increase the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
these internal control enhancements have resulted in substantially increased costs to us 
our management also regularly evaluates the effectiveness and design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting 
while we currently believe our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting which are in place are effective and properly documented  we may find it necessary to continue to incur substantially increased costs in future periods to further enhance our internal controls over financial reporting 
there can be no assurance that our continuing assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting will not result in increased costs of compliance which may adversely affect our available cash  our management team s attention to our core business  and our stock price 
the market trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile 
the market trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to significant fluctuations 
for example  the closing market trading price for our common stock has fluctuated over the past two years from a low of to a high of 
because of our stock s history of trading volatility  we believe that significant market fluctuations are likely to continue in future periods 
the trading market for our common stock may be limited 
approximately of our shares are held by non affiliates and there has historically been a low and inconsistent trading volume for our shares 
for example  the average daily trading volume for our shares for the two month period ended february  was approximately  shares 
there can be no assurance that an active and steady trading market  which is not subject to extreme fluctuations  will develop for our shares 
sales of common stock by existing shareholders  including officers or directors  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
approximately of our common stock is held by affiliates  including our officers and directors 
volume sales of stock by these affiliates in the trading market coupled with the historically low daily trading volume for our common stock may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we may fail to meet the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq capital market 
effective as of february   we began trading on the nasdaq capital market and ceased trading on amex 
however  due to the historic volatility of the market trading price of our common stock  there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet the requirements for continued listing on nasdaq 
our failure to comply with nasdaq listing standards could result in the delisting of our common stock by nasdaq  thereby limiting the ability of our shareholders to sell our common stock 
certain of our existing shareholders have the ability to exert a significant amount of control over the company 
as of december   robert e 
mead  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock and one related entity  grace brothers  ltd 
grace  beneficially owned of our common stock 
as a result  these individuals and entities are able to exert significant influence over the company and its activities  including the nomination  election and removal of our board of directors  the adoption of amendments to our charter documents  and the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our shareholders for approval  including mergers  consolidations  and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
mr 
mead s interests and grace s interest may conflict with the interests of other holders of our common stock and they may take actions affecting us with which other shareholders may disagree 
for example  if they determined to act in concert  grace and mr 
mead may decide not to enter into a transaction in which our shareholders would receive consideration for their shares that is much higher than the cost of their investment in our common stock  or than the then current market price of our common stock

on january   we purchased an additional acres contiguous to the orlando breeze resort 
we have not yet finalized plans for development of this property 
as of december   we had construction commitments of approximately million 
pinnacle lodge 
in april we purchased pinnacle lodge  a room hotel property located near the winter park recreational area in colorado which provides our owners with another destination vacation alternative and gives silverleaf an entry point into this increasingly popular destination area 
in december  we purchased  acres of undeveloped land near philadelphia  pennsylvania  for approximately million 
the property was intended to be developed as a getaway resort ie  beech mountain resort 
we received regulatory approval to develop units  vacation intervals  but we did not schedule dates for construction  completion of initial units  or commencement of marketing and sales efforts 
in  we determined that we would not develop this property as initially planned 
in  we sold this property for an aggregate sales price of million after related expenses  which resulted in a gain of million 
we also own a acre tract of land in the berkshire mountains of western massachusetts that we are in the initial stages of developing 
we have not yet finalized our future development plans for this site  however  we believe that its proximity to major population centers in the northeastern united states and the year round outdoor recreational attractions in the berkshire region make this property suitable for future development as a timeshare resort 
future growth strategy our future growth strategy is to conservatively increase annual revenues through a combination of continuing to develop new or existing resorts  maintaining marketing  sales  and development activities at those resorts in accordance with our current business model  concentrating on marketing to existing members  including sales of upgraded vacation intervals  additional week sales  and existing owner referral programs  adding other assets and amenities to attract our customers by enhancing vacation experiences  opening new off site sales centers in major metropolitan areas  and emphasizing our secondary products  such as biennial alternate year intervals  to broaden our potential market with a wider price range of products for first time buyers 
competitive advantages we believe our business affords us the following competitive advantages convenient getaway locations 
our getaway resorts are located within a two hour drive of a majority of our target customers residences  which accommodates what we believe to be the growing demand for shorter  more frequent  close to home vacations 
this proximity of our customer base to our resorts facilitates use of our bonus time program  allowing silverleaf owners to use vacant units  subject to availability and certain limitations 
we believe we are the only timeshare operator that offers customers these expanded use benefits 
silverleaf owners can also conveniently drive to and enjoy non lodging resort amenities at our resorts year round on a day use country club type basis 
substantial internal growth capacity 
at december   we had an inventory of  vacation intervals and a master plan to construct new units which will result in up to  additional vacation intervals at our existing resorts 
our master plan for construction of new units is contingent upon future sales at our existing resorts and the availability of financing  granting of governmental permits  and future land planning and site layout considerations 
in house operations 
we have in house marketing  sales  financing  development  and property management capabilities 
while we utilize outside contractors to supplement internal resources  our internal capabilities provide greater control over all phases of our operations  help maintain operating standards  and reduce overall costs 
lower construction and operating costs 
we have developed and generally employ standard architectural designs and operating procedures  which we believe significantly reduce construction and operating expenses 
standardization and integration also allow us to rapidly develop new inventory in response to demand 
weather permitting  new units at existing resorts can normally be constructed on an as needed basis within to days 
centralized property management supervision 
we presently supervise the operation of all of our existing resorts except for orlando breeze on an integrated  centralized  and collective basis through our management agreement with silverleaf club with operating and maintenance costs paid from silverleaf owners monthly dues 
while our orlando breeze resort in florida has its own separate club orlando breeze resort club we also provide centralized supervision of its operations under the terms of a written agreement  to ensure the quality of services provided to orlando breeze timeshare owners 
we believe that consolidation of resort operations benefits silverleaf owners by providing them with a uniform level of service  accommodations  and amenities on a standardized  cost effective basis 
integration also facilitates our internal exchange program and the bonus time program 
experienced management 
our senior management has extensive experience in the acquisition  development  marketing  sales  and operation of timeshare resorts 
the senior officers have an average of seventeen years of experience in the timeshare industry

furthermore  the resorts offer different vacation activities  including golf  fishing  boating  swimming  horseback riding  tennis  and archery 
destination resorts are located in or near areas with national tourist appeal 
features common to the existing resorts include the following bonus time program 
silverleaf club s bonus time program offers silverleaf owners a benefit not typically enjoyed by other timeshare owners 
in addition to the right to use a unit one week per year  the bonus time program allows all silverleaf owners  who are current on their dues and installment payments  to use vacant units for up to three nights at a time at any of our owned resorts 
sunday through thursday night stays are currently without charge  while friday through saturday stays presently cost per night payable to silverleaf club 
the bonus time program is limited based on the availability of units 
availability is created when a silverleaf owner does not use his or her owned week 
silverleaf owners who have utilized the resort less frequently are given priority to use the program and may only use an interval with an equal or lower rating than their owned vacation interval 
we believe this program is important as many vacationers prefer shorter two to three day vacations 
owners of unused intervals that are utilized by the bonus time program are not compensated other than by their participation in the bonus time program 
silverleaf plus program 
in february  we began offering the new silverleaf plus program 
this program  administered through silverleaf club  includes all of the prior benefits to silverleaf owners plus enhanced vacation options through the silverleaf exchange program 
in addition to use of their owned weeks and bonus time  silverleaf owners who purchase under the silverleaf plus program can also split their weeks into a minimum of day up to day increments  and extend any unused days into the following year 
year round use of amenities 
even when not using the lodging facilities  silverleaf owners have unlimited year round day usage of the amenities located at the existing resorts  such as boating  fishing  miniature golf  tennis  swimming  or hiking  for little or no additional cost 
certain amenities  however  such as golf  horseback riding  or watercraft rentals  may require a usage fee 
exchange privileges 
each silverleaf owner has certain exchange privileges through the silverleaf club which may be used on an annual basis to i exchange an interval for a different interval week at the same resort so long as the desired interval is of an equal or lower rating  or ii exchange an interval for the same interval week of equal or lower rating at any other of our existing resorts 
silverleaf owners of getaway resorts can only exchange for an interval in a getaway resort unless they own a presidents or chairmans vacation interval 
these exchange rights are a convenience we provide silverleaf owners as an accommodation to them  and are conditioned upon availability of the desired interval or resort 
approximately  exchanges occurred in silverleaf owners pay an exchange fee of to silverleaf club for each such internal exchange 
in addition  most silverleaf owners may join the exchange program administered by rci for an annual fee of orlando breeze  is not under contract with rci  however it is under contract with interval international  inc  a competitor of rci 
deeded ownership 
we typically sell a vacation interval that entitles the owner to use a specific unit for a designated one week interval each year 
the vacation interval purchaser receives a recorded deed  which grants the purchaser a percentage interest in a specific unit for a designated week 
we also sell a biennial alternate year vacation interval that allows the owner to use a unit for a one week interval every other year with reduced dues 
management club 
each of the existing resorts has a club for the benefit of the timeshare owners 
at december   the clubs except for the club at orlando breeze operate under silverleaf club to manage the existing resorts on a centralized and collective basis 
we have contracted with silverleaf club to perform the supervisory and management functions granted by the clubs 
costs of these operations are covered by monthly dues paid by timeshare owners to their respective clubs together with income generated by the operation of certain amenities at each respective resort 
our destination resort in florida  orlando breeze  has its own club  orlando breeze resort club  which operates independently of silverleaf club  however  we supervise the management and operation of the orlando breeze resort club under the terms of a written agreement 
on site security

prominent among this limited group are the walt disney company  hilton hotels corporation  and marriott international inc which are i diversified  with far less than of their respective revenues attributable to vacation ownership interval sales  and ii substantially larger than we are in terms of revenue  assets and market capitalization 
therefore  we concluded that there was not a sufficient body of reliable market data for us to use a comparison peer group 
therefore  since we have used the russell index as an index of issuers with similar market capitalization

our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
executive summary we are in the business of owning and operating thirteen timeshare resorts as of december  our income is derived principally from marketing and selling timeshare interests at our resorts in one week intervals  and from the interest earned from financed sales of such timeshare interests 
as of december   seven of our resorts are located within one and one half to two hours of major metropolitan areas getaway resorts  which are the primary market for timeshare sales to new purchasers 
six of our resorts are in destination resort areas located further from major metropolitan areas destination resorts 
the principal purchasers of timeshare interests at the destination resorts are existing owners who are upgrading or buying additional interests 
the following economic or industry wide factors are relevant to us we sell a vacation and recreational product  predominantly to customers who drive to our locations 
we believe that this type of usage is somewhat immune from issues that would affect the travel industry as a whole ie the disruptions to the airline industry and destination resort industry after september   but major increases in gasoline prices or other issues that cause the u 
s population to drive less could have a negative impact on us 
telemarketing is a very important element in the generation of tours to potential new customers of timeshare interests 
we presently comply with state and national do not call regulations 
changes to existing regulations could have a negative impact on our ability to generate the necessary tours to sell timeshare interests 
we finance the majority of our sales over seven to ten years 
an economic downturn could negatively affect the ability of our customers to pay their principal and interest  which might result in additional provision for uncollectible notes 
our fixed to floating debt ratio is fixed and floating 
an increase in interest rates above the floor rates on our variable rate facilities could have a negative impact on our profitability 
since we predominantly finance our sales of timeshare interests  we require credit facilities to have the liquidity necessary to fund our costs and expenses 
we presently have adequate credit facilities to fund our operations through december a disruption in the availability of credit facilities would severely impact our ability to continue marketing and selling timeshare interests as we do today 
in the first quarter of  we consolidated our debt with textron financial corporation into one revolving loan 
as a result of the amended and restated loan and security agreement  the funding period on the consolidated debt has been extended from june to january  with revised maturity dates of january  for the receivables component and january  on both the acquisition and inventory components 
in addition  the interest rates previously charged have been reduced 
this transaction is described in more detail under the heading subsequent events in note to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f we believe there are two areas which are particularly important to our success as a business the first area is identifying potential customers who are likely to pay their principal and interest payments when due after purchasing timeshare intervals  thereby resulting in an acceptable provision for uncollectible notes 
the second area is to keep sales and marketing expenses at an acceptable level to result in a favorable percentage relationship between sales and marketing expense and vacation interval sales 
we earn revenue and income and finance our operations as follows our primary source of revenue is vacation interval sales 
vacation interval sales are a combination of sales to new customers and upgrade and or additional week sales to existing customers 
we have been focusing on increasing the percentage mix of sales to existing customers in   and in addition we have been focusing on identifying potential new customers who have better credit characteristics that will ultimately be more likely to pay their principal and interest when due 
to manage sales we assess separately sales to potential new customers and sales to existing customers 
for sales to potential new customers we measure sales per tour in order to ascertain that our marketing programs are delivering the proper types of family tours to effectively and efficiently sell to new customers 
state law allows purchasers of timeshares to rescind their purchase within three to fifteen days depending on the state 
we also measure rescission amounts and rates of new customers to ascertain that our marketing and sales programs continue effectively 
the number of tours to existing customers is not meaningful 
as a result  we begin our assessment of sales to existing customers by totaling gross sales to existing customers 
rescissions by existing customers are generally much lower than rescissions by new customers 
we do measure rescission amounts and rates to calculate net sales to existing customers 
we then combine net sales to new and existing customers to calculate total vacation interval sales 
one product that is sold to new customers is a sampler  which gives the customer the right to use the resorts on an as available basis from sunday to thursday 
revenues related to sampler contracts  which entitle the prospective owner to sample a resort during certain periods  have been and will continue to be deferred until the customer uses the stay or allows the contract to expire 
effective january   sampler sales and related costs are accounted for as incidental operations  whereby incremental costs in excess of incremental revenue are charged to expense as incurred and the operations are presented as a net expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
conversely  incremental revenue in excess of incremental costs is recorded as a reduction of inventory in the consolidated balance sheet 
incremental costs include costs that would not have been incurred had we not sold samplers 
during the year ended december   all sampler sales were recorded as a reduction to sales and marketing expense since direct and incremental costs of sampler sales exceeded incremental sampler sales 
the amount of the reduction to sales and marketing expense for sampler sales in was million 
prior to sfas no 
 sampler sales were reported separately as revenue 
we recognized million and million in revenues from sampler sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the following table shows the elements management considers important to assessing our vacation interval sales dollars in thousands  except for sales per tour year ended december  tours to potential new purchasers sales per tour gross sales to new customers rescission of sales to new customers net sales to new customers gross sales to existing customers rescission of sales to existing customers net sales to existing customers total sales less sampler sales total vacation interval sales rescission rate for new customers rescission rate for existing customers rescission rate for all customers in assessing the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs  we believe it is also important to compare sales and marketing expenses to sales 
the separate elements of sales and marketing expense that we assess are the cost of marketing to new purchasers  the cost of marketing to existing purchasers  offsite marketing  commissions  and sales and marketing overhead  as detailed in the following table dollars in thousands  except for cost per tour year ended december  tours to potential new purchasers cost per tour rounded to nearest whole dollar cost of marketing to new purchasers cost of marketing to existing purchasers offsite marketing commissions sales and marketing overhead sampler sales offset total sales and marketing expense as a percentage of vacation interval sales cost of marketing to new purchasers cost of marketing to existing purchasers offsite marketing commissions sales and marketing overhead sampler sales offset total sales and marketing expense our second most important source of revenue is interest income  which is predominantly earned on our notes receivable 
interest income as a percentage of notes receivable has increased each year from through as a result of periodically increasing the interest rate we charged our new customers 
we have three lesser revenue sources 
they are management fees  predominantly from silverleaf club  gain on sale of notes receivable from our sale of notes receivable to our off balance sheet special purpose entities  and other income 
the gain on sale of notes receivable were million  million and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we generate cash from the collection of down payments  principal and interest from purchasers of timeshare interval sales  the sales of notes receivable and from management fees and other income 
we also generated cash in and from the sale of undeveloped land at locations that had been previously acquired for the possible development of new resorts 
since the majority of our sales are financed  we have revolving credit facilities that are drawn on monthly to fund our costs  expenses and capital expenditures 
we operate principally in only one business segment  the timeshare industry 
further  we only operate in the united states 
as of december   we operate resorts in six states texas  missouri  illinois  massachusetts  georgia  and florida  and sell primarily to residents of those states  with limited sales to residents of nearby states 
in april  we purchased pinnacle lodge  a hotel property located near the winter park recreational area in colorado which provides our owners with another destination vacation alternative and gives silverleaf an entry point into this increasingly popular destination area 
our principal short term focus is on continuing to conservatively increase annual revenues 
we will continue to identify new and existing customers with acceptable credit characteristics that will allow us to profitably sell new  upgrade  and additional vacation intervals at our existing resorts 
long term  if the opportunities present themselves  we will consider adding and developing new resorts where timeshare intervals can be marketed and sold at a profit 
critical accounting policies revenue and expense recognition as required  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for real estate time sharing transactions as of january  the adoption of sfas no 
prospectively revises the classification of certain revenue and cost activity 
however  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our reported net income for the year ended december   nor did it result in a cumulative effect adjustment 
a substantial portion of vacation interval sales are made in exchange for mortgage notes receivable  which are secured by a deed of trust on the vacation interval sold 
we recognize the sale of a vacation interval under the full accrual method after a binding sales contract has been executed  the buyer has made a down payment of at least  and the statutory rescission period has expired 
if all accrual method criteria are met except that significant development costs remain to complete the project or phase  revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion basis 
under this method  the amount of revenue recognized based on the sales value at the time a sale is recognized is measured by the relationship of costs already incurred to the total of costs already incurred and estimated future costs 
the remaining amount is deferred and recognized as the remaining costs are incurred 
there were no sales deferred at december  related to the percentage of completion method 
both of the above methods employ the relative sales value method in accounting for costs of sales and inventory  which are applied to each phase separately 
generally  we consider each building a separate phase 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 in determining relative sales value  an estimate of uncollectibility is used to reduce the estimate of total vacation interval revenue under the project  both actual to date plus expected future revenue 
the relative sales value method is used to allocate inventory cost and determine cost of sales in conjunction with a sale 
under the relative sales value method  cost of sales is estimated as a percentage of net sales using a cost of sales percentage which represents the ratio of total estimated cost  including both costs already incurred plus estimated costs to complete the phase  if any  to total estimated vacation interval revenue under the project 
common costs  including amenities  are allocated to inventory cost among the phases that those costs are expected to benefit  and are included in total estimated costs 
the estimate of total revenue for a phase  which includes both actual to date revenues and expected future revenues  incorporates factors such as actual or estimated uncollectibles  changes in sales mix and unit sales prices  repossessions of intervals  effects of upgrade programs  and past and expected sales programs to sell slow moving inventory units 
on at least a quarterly basis  we evaluate the estimated cost of sales percentage  using updated information for total estimated phase revenue and total estimated phase costs  both actual to date and expected in the future 
the effects of changes in estimates are accounted for in the period in which they first become known on a retrospective basis using a current period adjustment 
certain vacation interval sales transactions are deferred until the minimum down payment has been received 
we account for these transactions utilizing the deposit method 
under this method  the sale is not recognized  a receivable is not recorded  and inventory is not relieved 
any cash received is carried as a deposit until the sale can be recognized 
when these types of sales are cancelled without a refund  deposits forfeited are recognized as income and the interest portion is recognized as interest income 
this income is not significant 
in addition to sales of vacation intervals to new prospective owners  we sell additional and upgraded vacation intervals to existing owners 
revenues are recognized on an additional vacation interval sale  which is a new interval sale that is treated as a separate transaction from the original vacation interval for accounting purposes  when the buyer makes a down payment of at least  excluding any equity from the original vacation interval purchased 
revenues are recognized on an upgrade vacation interval sale  which is a modification and continuation of the original sale  by including the buyer s equity from the original vacation interval towards the down payment of at least 
the additional accrual method criteria described above must also be satisfied for revenue recognition of additional and upgraded vacation intervals 
the revenue recognized on upgrade vacation interval sales is the difference between the upgrade sales price and traded in sales price  and cost of sales is the incremental increase in the cost of the vacation interval purchased 
we recognize interest income as earned 
interest income is accrued on notes receivable  net of an estimated amount that will not be collected  until the individual notes become days delinquent 
once a note becomes days delinquent  the accrual of interest income ceases until collection is deemed probable 
we receive fees for management services provided to each timeshare resort s owners association a club 
these revenues are recognized on an accrual basis in the period the services are provided if collection is deemed probable 
services and other income are recognized on an accrual basis in the period service is provided 
sales and marketing costs are charged to expense in the period incurred 
commissions  however  are recognized in the same period as the revenue is recognized 
allowance for uncollectible notes beginning january   estimated uncollectible revenue  which is an offset to vacation interval sales  is recorded at an amount sufficient to maintain the allowance for uncollectible notes at a level management considers adequate to provide for anticipated losses resulting from customers failure to fulfill their obligations under the terms of their notes 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 this line item was recorded as an expense provision for uncollectible notes 
the allowance for uncollectible notes is adjusted based upon periodic analysis of the notes receivable portfolio  historical credit loss experience  and current economic factors 
credit losses take three forms 
the first is the full cancellation of the note  whereby the customer is relieved of the obligation and we recover the underlying inventory 
the second form is a deemed cancellation  whereby we record the cancellation of all notes that become days delinquent  net of notes that are no longer days delinquent 
the third form is the note receivable reduction that occurs when a customer trades a higher value product for a lower value product 
in estimating the allowance  we project future cancellations and credit losses for each sales year by using historical cancellations experience 
the allowance for uncollectible notes is reduced by actual cancellations and losses experienced  including losses related to previously sold notes receivable which became delinquent and were reacquired pursuant to the recourse obligations discussed herein 
recourse to the company on sales of customer notes receivable is governed by the agreements between the purchasers and the company 
the provision for uncollectible notes as a percentage of vacation interval sales was reported as in the provision expense line for the year ended december  in accordance with sfas no 
and as discussed previously  estimated losses on vacation interval notes receivable are recorded as a reduction to vacation interval sales beginning in rather than as an expense item provision for uncollectible notes  as it was recorded prior to our estimated uncollectible revenue as a percentage of vacation interval sales was for the year ended december  our provision for uncollectible notes as a percentage of vacation interval sales was and for the years ended december  and as noted above  an estimate for the value of inventory recoveries was included as a reduction to the provision for uncollectible notes prior to but is now included as a component in the relative sales value method of our inventory costing and allocation accounting 
considering the estimate for inventory recoveries  our net provision for expected credit losses would have been lower for the year ended december  versus the year ended december  the net improvement is due to the improved performance of notes originated in through as compared to notes originated in earlier years  before we implemented programs focused on selling to customers with a higher quality of credit 
we will continue our current collection programs and seek new programs to reduce note defaults and improve the credit quality of our customers 
however  there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost includes amounts for land  construction materials  amenities and common costs  direct labor and overhead  taxes  and capitalized interest incurred in the construction or through the acquisition of resort dwellings held for timeshare sale 
timeshare unit costs are capitalized as inventory and are allocated to cost of vacation interval sales based upon their relative sales values 
we estimate the total cost to complete all amenities at each resort 
this cost includes both costs incurred to date and expected costs to be incurred 
at december   the estimated costs not yet incurred  which are expected to complete promised amenities was million 
we allocate the estimated promised and completed amenities cost to cost of vacation interval sales based on vacation intervals sold in a given period as a percentage of total vacation intervals expected to sell over the life of a particular resort project 
the relative sales value method of recording vacation interval cost of sales has been amended by sfas no 
beginning january  to include estimated future defaults of uncollectible sales and the subsequent resale of the recovered vacation intervals reacquired on future cancelled sales in our total estimate of revenues we expect to earn on a project 
we periodically review the carrying value of our inventory on an individual project basis for impairment  to ensure that the carrying value does not exceed market value 
management periodically reviews the carrying value of our inventory on an individual project basis to ensure that the carrying value does not exceed market value 
vacation intervals may be reacquired as a result of i foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure and ii trade in associated with the purchase of an upgraded or downgraded vacation interval 
vacation intervals reacquired are recorded in inventory at the lower of their original cost or market value 
vacation intervals that have been reacquired are relieved from inventory on a specific identification basis when resold 
inventory acquired several years ago through our program to reacquire vacation intervals owned but not actively used by silverleaf owners has a significantly lower average cost basis than recently constructed inventory  contributing significantly to historical operating margins 
newer inventory added through our construction and acquisition programs has a higher average cost than our older inventory 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  and all periods thereafter  we have been in full compliance with our debt covenants in our credit facilities with all of our senior lenders 
the following table summarizes our credit agreements with our senior lenders and our off balance sheet special purpose finance subsidiary  sf iii  as of december  in thousands maximum amount available balance receivable based revolvers receivable based non revolvers inventory loans sub total on balance sheet off balance sheet receivable based term loan grand total we use these credit agreements to finance the sale of vacation intervals  to finance construction  and for working capital needs 
the loans mature between april and july  and are collateralized or cross collateralized by customer notes receivable  inventory  construction in process  land  improvements  and related equipment at certain of the existing resorts 
our fixed to floating debt ratio at december  was fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
the credit facilities that bear interest at variable rates are tied to the prime rate  libor  or the corporate rate charged by certain banks 
the credit facilities secured by customer notes receivable allow advances of to of the unpaid balance of certain eligible customer notes receivable 
in addition  we have million of senior subordinated notes due april  million of senior subordinated notes due april  and million of senior subordinated notes due april  with interest payable semi annually on april and october  guaranteed by all of our present and future domestic restricted subsidiaries 
sources of cash 
we generate cash primarily from the cash received on the sale of vacation intervals  the financing of customer notes receivable from silverleaf owners  the sale of notes receivable to our special purpose entities  management fees  sampler sales  marina income  golf course and pro shop income  and utility operations through the first quarter of 
we typically receive a to down payment on sales of vacation intervals and finance the remainder by receipt of a seven year to ten year customer promissory note 
we generate cash from the financing of customer notes receivable by i borrowing at an advance rate of to of eligible customer notes receivable  ii selling notes receivable  and iii from the spread between interest received on customer notes receivable and interest paid on related borrowings 
because we use significant amounts of cash in the development and marketing of vacation intervals  but collect cash on customer notes receivable over a seven year to ten year period  borrowing against receivables has historically been a necessary part of normal operations 
during the years ended december  and  we had net cash provided by operating activities of million and million  respectively 
in  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of increased sales of notes receivable  partially offset by the increase in our maximum exposure to loss regarding our involvement with sf iii 
operating activities typically reflect net cash provided by operations  however for the year ended december  we had net cash used in operating activities of million 
the net decrease in cash flow of million between and resulted primarily from cash provided by the sale of notes receivable in of million 
there were no sales of notes receivable in in addition  we had a increase in vacation interval sales in which resulted in a million increase in cash used for financing of sales between and construction of additional units at our existing resorts also increased million in although it appears we have adequate liquidity to meet our needs through  we are continuing to identify additional financing arrangements into and beyond 
to finance our growth  development  and any future expansion plans  we may at some time be required to consider the issuance of other debt  equity  or collateralized mortgage backed securities 
any debt we incur or issue may be secured or unsecured  have fixed or variable rate interest  and may be subject to such terms as management deems prudent 
in the first quarter of  we consolidated our debt with textron financial corporation into one revolving loan 
as a result of the amended and restated loan and security agreement  the funding period on the consolidated debt has been extended from june to january  with revised maturity dates of january  for the receivables component and january  on both the acquisition and inventory components 
in addition  the interest rates previously charged have been reduced 
this transaction is described in more detail under the heading subsequent events in note to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f uses of cash 
investing activities typically reflect a net use of cash due to capital additions and property acquisitions 
however  for the year ended  net cash provided by investing activities was million 
in  the net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to the sale of our water distribution and waste water treatment utilities assets at eight of our resorts  and the sale of undeveloped land located in luzerne county  pennsylvania 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
in the net cash used in investing activities consisted of equipment purchases 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities for the year was primarily due to the purchase of the following assets in  pinnacle lodge  a room hotel located near the winter park recreational area in colorado  two offsite sales offices  and a corporate aircraft 
we also began construction on a water park at one of our resorts in we evaluate sites for additional new resorts or acquisitions on an ongoing basis 
net cash used in financing activities for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
during  the increase in cash used in financing activities was the result of increased payments on borrowings against pledged notes receivable and the repurchase of previously sold notes 
we paid fair value for the outstanding balance of notes receivable under sf i  two non revolving loans with one of our senior lenders  three term notes with another senior lender  and the outstanding balance under both the receivable and inventory loans with a third senior lender 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended december  this was due primarily to borrowings under the sf v series a notes which originated in at december   our senior credit facilities provided for loans of up to million  of which approximately million of principal related to advances under the credit facilities was outstanding 
at december   the weighted average cost of funds for all borrowings was 
customer defaults have a significant impact on cash available to us from financing customer notes receivable in that notes more than days past due are not eligible as collateral 
as a result  we must repay borrowings against such delinquent notes 
as of december   million of notes were more than days past due 
certain debt agreements include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends based on minimum levels of net income and cash flow 
the payment of dividends might also be restricted by the texas business corporation act 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we entered into a million revolving credit agreement to finance vacation interval notes receivable through sf i  our off balance sheet special purpose entity during we agreed to reduce the principal amount of the facility from million to million in  and during the first quarter of the facility amount was further reduced to million 
during  we sold million of notes receivable to sf i and recognized pre tax gains of million 
in conjunction with these sales  we received cash consideration of million  which was primarily used to pay down borrowings under our revolving loan facilities 
during  we sold million of notes receivable to sf i and recognized pre tax gains of million 
in conjunction with these sales  we received cash consideration of million  which was used to pay down borrowings under our revolving loan facilities 
during  we sold million of notes receivable to sf i and recognized pre tax gains of  in conjunction with these sales  we received cash consideration of million  which was used to pay down borrowings under our revolving loan facilities 
sf i funded all of these purchases through advances under a credit agreement arranged for this purpose 
we receive fees for servicing sold receivables  calculated based on of eligible receivables held by the facility 
such fees were   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
such fees received approximate our internal cost of servicing such receivables  and approximates the fee a third party would receive to service such receivables 
as a result  the related servicing asset or liability was estimated to be insignificant 
during the third quarter of we closed a term securitization transaction with a wholly owned off balance sheet qualified special purpose finance subsidiary  sf iii  a delaware limited liability company  which was formed for the purpose of issuing million of its series a notes in a private placement through ubs securities llc 
the series a notes were issued pursuant to an indenture indenture between silverleaf  as servicer of the timeshare loans  sf iii  and wells fargo bank  national association  as indenture trustee  custodian  backup servicer  and account intermediary 
the series a notes were issued in four classes ranging from class a through class d notes with a blended fixed rate of 
the class a notes  class b notes  class c notes and class d notes have received a rating from moody s investor services  inc of aaa  aa  a and baa  respectively 
the series a notes are secured by timeshare receivables sold to sf iii by us pursuant to a transfer agreement between sf iii and us 
under that agreement  we sold to sf iii approximately million in timeshare receivables that were previously pledged as collateral under revolving credit facilities with our senior lenders and sf i  and recognized a pre tax gain of million 
in connection with this sale  we received gross cash consideration of million  which was primarily used to pay off in full the credit facility of sf i and to pay down amounts we owed under credit facilities with our senior lenders 
we dissolved sf i simultaneously with the sale of the timeshare receivables to sf iii 
the timeshare receivables we sold to sf iii are without recourse to us  except for breaches of certain representations and warranties at the time of sale 
we are responsible for servicing the timeshare receivables purchased by sf iii pursuant to the terms of the indenture and will receive a fee for our services equal to of eligible timeshare receivables held by the facility 
such fees were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
such fees received approximate our internal cost of servicing such timeshare receivables  and approximates the fee a third party would receive to service such receivables 
as a result  the related servicing asset or liability was estimated to be insignificant 
at december   sf iii held notes receivable totaling million  with related borrowings of million 
except for the repurchase of notes that fail to meet initial eligibility requirements  we are not obligated to repurchase defaulted or any other contracts sold to sf iii 
as the servicer of the notes receivable sold to sf iii  we are obligated by the terms of the conduit facility to foreclose upon the vacation interval securing a defaulted note receivable 
we may  but are not obligated to  purchase the foreclosed vacation interval for an amount equal to the net fair market value of the vacation interval if the net fair market value is no less than fifteen percent of the original acquisition price that the customer paid for the vacation interval 
for the year ended december   we paid approximately million to repurchase the vacation intervals securing defaulted contracts to facilitate the re marketing of those vacation intervals 
our total investment in sf iii was carried at million at december   which represents our maximum exposure to loss regarding our involvement with sf iii 
our special purpose entities allow us to realize the benefit of additional credit availability we have with our current senior lenders 
we require credit facilities to have the liquidity necessary to fund our costs and expenses  therefore it is vitally important to our liquidity plan to have financing available to us in order to finance future sales  since we finance the majority of our timeshare sales over seven to ten years 
income taxes 
for regular federal income tax purposes  we report substantially all of the vacation interval sales we finance under the installment method 
under this method  income on sales of vacation intervals is not recognized until cash is received  either in the form of a down payment or as installment payments on customer notes receivable 
the deferral of income tax liability conserves cash resources on a current basis 
interest is imposed  however  on the amount of tax attributable to the installment payments for the period beginning on the date of sale and ending on the date the payment is received 
if we are not subject to tax in a particular year  no interest is imposed since the interest is based on the amount of tax paid in that year 
the consolidated financial statements do not contain an accrual for any interest expense that would be paid on the deferred taxes related to the installment method as the interest expense is not estimable 
in addition  we are subject to current alternative minimum tax amt as a result of the deferred income that results from the installment sales treatment 
payment of amt creates a deferred tax asset in the form of a minimum tax credit  which  unless otherwise limited  reduces the future regular tax liability attributable to vacation interval sales 
due to amt losses in certain years prior to  which offset all amt income for years prior to  no minimum tax credit exists for years prior to nevertheless  we had significant amt for and anticipate that we will pay significant amt in future years 
the federal net operating losses nols expire between through realization of the deferred tax assets arising from nols is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards 
due to the exchange offer that took place during  an ownership change within the meaning of section g of the internal revenue code the code occurred 
as a result  a portion of our nol is subject to an annual limitation for taxable years beginning after the date of the exchange change date and a portion of the taxable year that includes the change date 
this annual limitation may be increased for any recognized built in gain to the extent allowed in section h of the code 
there is an annual limitation of approximately  which was the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change  multiplied by the applicable long term tax exempt rate 
we believe that approximately million of our net operating loss carryforwards as of december   are subject to the section limitations 
discontinued operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 the water and utility property assets and liabilities were designated as held for sale effective december  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 the results of operations of these properties are included in income from discontinued operations 
prior periods have been reclassified for comparability  as required 
the carrying amounts of the water and utility property assets were as of december  on march   we sold the water distribution and waste water treatment utilities assets at eight of our timeshare resorts for an aggregate sales price of million  which resulted in a pretax gain of  during the third quarter of  once all conditions of the sale were met 
the purchasers of the utilities are algonquin water resources  of texas  llc  a texas limited liability company  algonquin water resources of missouri  llc  a missouri limited liability company  algonquin water resources of illinois  llc  an illinois limited liability company  algonquin water resources of america  inc  a delaware corporation  and algonquin power income fund  an open ended investment trust established under the laws of ontario  canada collectively  the purchasers 
certain of the purchasers have entered into a services agreement to provide uninterrupted water supply and waste water treatment services to our eight timeshare resorts to which the transferred utility assets relate 
the purchasers will charge our timeshare resorts the tariffed rate for those utility services that are regulated by the states in which the resorts are located 
for any unregulated utility services  the purchasers will charge a rate set in accordance with the ratemaking procedures of the texas commission on environmental quality 
the proceeds of our sale of these utility assets were used to reduce senior debt in accordance with our loan agreements with our senior lenders 
notwithstanding the closing of this sale of utilities assets  our agreement with the purchasers contains provisions relating to the required post closing receipt of customary governmental approvals from utility regulators in missouri and texas 
during the third quarter of  the purchasers received governmental approval from the utility regulators in missouri 
approval from the utility regulators in texas is still pending at this time 
however  we entered into an amendment during july in which the deadline for obtaining required approvals from the appropriate texas regulatory agencies was extended from september to march during february  the deadline for obtaining approval from the texas regulatory agencies was extended another days from march to june if the purchasers do not receive required approvals from texas regulators relating to the utility assets in texas the texas assets by june  the texas assets will be reconveyed to us  the transaction involving the texas assets will be rescinded  and we will be obligated to return to the purchasers approximately million of the purchase price attributable to the texas assets 
the condensed consolidated statements of operations for discontinued operations are summarized as follows in thousands year ended december  revenues gain on sale of discontinued operations other income total revenues costs and operating expenses other expense depreciation interest expense total costs and operating expenses income from discontinued operations provision for income taxes income from discontinued operations there were no discontinued operations during the year ended december results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating information for the company

 total revenue for the year ended december  is decreased by estimated uncollectible revenue of million  which represents estimated future gross cancellations of notes receivable prior to any recoveries of inventory 
in addition  under sfas no 
 sampler sales are accounted for as incidental operations  which require that any such incidental revenues be recorded as a reduction of incremental costs or expenses 
accordingly  million of sampler sales  which would have been reported as revenue prior to adoption of sfas no 
 were accounted for as a reduction to sales and marketing expense in the year ended december  had these two changes mandated by sfas no 
not been made  revenues would have increased by to million 
the following table summarizes our vacation interval sales dollars in thousands  except average price 
average average sales units price sales units price interval sales to new customers upgrade interval sales to existing customers additional interval sales to existing customers total overall  vacation interval sales increased in versus  due to increased interval sales to both new and existing customers as a result of increased demand from our existing customers for upgraded intervals  higher closing percentages  and lower rescission rates 
the number of interval sales to new customers increased and average prices increased  resulting in a net increase in vacation interval sales to new customers in versus the number of interval sales to existing customers increased and average prices increased  resulting in a net increase in sales to existing customers during versus we anticipate continued growth in our annual vacation interval sales in this growth will be achieved through a combination of increased sales to new customers 
increased upgrade sales and additional week sales to existing customers 
potentially opening new resorts 
we have identified potential markets for future expansion that may include winter park  colorado  washington dc  las vegas  wisconsin dells  and or myrtle beach  south carolina 
depending on the size and location  a new resort s land  infrastructure  and amenities will cost between million and million 
anticipate a permanent opening of our second off site sales center near chicago  illinois 
estimated uncollectible revenue was million for the year ended december  versus reported on this line for as discussed previously  sfas no 
requires the estimated uncollectible revenue to be recorded as a reduction to vacation interval sales and no longer net of inventory recovery beginning in rather than as an expense item provision for uncollectible notes  as it was previously recorded 
sampler sales primarily function as a marketing program  allowing us additional opportunities to sell a vacation interval to a prospective customer 
sampler sales are not recognized in the consolidated statement of operations until the customer uses the stay or our obligation has elapsed  which often does not occur until the sampler contract expires eighteen months after the sale is consummated 
sampler sales for the year were reported as compared to million for beginning in per sfas no 
 sampler sales and related costs are accounted for as incidental operations  whereby incremental costs in excess of incremental revenue are charged to expense as incurred and the operations are presented as a net expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
conversely  incremental revenue in excess of incremental costs is recorded as a reduction of inventory 
incremental costs include costs that would not have been incurred had we not sold samplers 
during the year ended december   all sampler sales of million were recorded as a reduction to sales and marketing expense  since incremental costs of sampler sales exceeded incremental sampler sales 
interest income increased million  or  to for the year ended december  from million for the increase primarily resulted from a higher average notes receivable balance in versus the same period of  a million increase in interest accretion related to the investment in special purpose entity for the year ended december  versus the year ended december   and an increase in the average yield on our outstanding notes receivable to at december  from at december  management fee income  which consists of management fees collected from the resorts management clubs  cannot exceed the management clubs net income 
management fee income remained constant at million for both years ended december  and there were no sales of notes receivable during the year of gain on sale of notes receivable was million during  resulting from the sale of million and million of notes receivable to sf i and sf iii  respectively  and recognizing pre tax gains of  and million  respectively 
in connection with the sale to sf i  we received cash consideration of million  which was used to pay down borrowings under our senior revolving loan facilities 
in connection with the sale to sf iii  we received gross cash consideration of million  which was used to pay off in full the credit facility of sf i and to pay down borrowings under our senior revolving loan facilities 
other income consists of marina income  golf course and pro shop income  and other miscellaneous items 
other income decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to a million gain on the sale of undeveloped land located in pennsylvania during  which is partially offset by a million gain on the sale of two parcels of mississippi land during other than these two land sales  other income remained fairly constant for the years ended december  and cost of vacation interval sales cost of sales as a percentage of vacation interval sales decreased to in  versus in this decrease is primarily due to the implementation of sfas no 
effective january   which amends the relative sales value method of recording vacation interval cost of sales to include an estimate of future defaults of uncollectible revenue  both actual to date plus expected future revenue 
the relative sales value method is used to allocate inventory cost and determine cost of sales in conjunction with a sale 
under the relative sales value method  cost of sales is estimated as a percentage of net sales using a cost of sales percentage which represents the ratio of total estimated cost  including both costs already incurred plus costs to complete the phase  if any  to total estimated vacation interval revenue under the project  including amounts already recognized and future revenues 
common costs  including amenities  are allocated to inventory cost among the phases that those costs are expected to benefit 
the estimate of total revenue for a phase  which includes both actual to date revenues and expected future revenues  incorporates factors such as actual or estimated uncollectibles  changes in sales mix and unit sales prices  repossessions of intervals  effects of upgrade programs  and past and expected future sales programs to sell slow moving inventory units 
for comparability  had cost of sales not been reduced by the estimated future recoveries of inventory  as described above  cost of sales for would have been of vacation interval sales versus in higher average sales prices during compared to contributed to the reduction in cost of sales as a percentage of vacation interval sales 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of vacation interval sales decreased to for the year ended december  versus for the same period of in accordance with sfas no 
and as discussed in sampler sales above  million of sampler revenues were recorded as a reduction to sales and marketing expense since the incremental costs of our sampler sales exceeded incremental sampler revenue 
had sales and marketing expense not been reduced by sampler sales  sales and marketing expense would have been of vacation interval sales for the year ended december  the increase compared to the previous year is due to our costs associated with our newly opened off site sales centers as well as the investment in securing additional personnel and processes ahead of the expected growth for which we are planning 
provision for uncollectible notes the provision for uncollectible notes as a percentage of vacation interval sales was reported as in the provision expense line for in accordance with sfas no

 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities

this new standard also permits an election for fair value re measurement of any hybrid financial instrument containing an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation under sfas no 
the fair value election can be applied on an instrument by instrument basis to existing instruments at the date of adoption and can be applied to new instruments on a prospective basis 
this statement shall be effective for all financial instruments acquired  issued  or subject to a remeasurement new basis event occurring after the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after september  the fair value election provided for in paragraph c of this statement may also be applied upon adoption of this statement for hybrid financial instruments that had been bifurcated under paragraph of statement prior to the adoption of this statement 
earlier adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year  provided the entity has not yet issued financial statements  including financial statements for any interim period for that fiscal year

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements 
sab requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both an income statement rollover and balance sheet iron curtain approach and evaluate whether either approach results in a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
if prior year errors that had been previously considered immaterial now are considered material based on either approach  no restatement is required so long as management properly applied its previous approach and all relevant facts and circumstances were considered 
if prior years are not restated  the cumulative effect adjustment is recorded in opening accumulated earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending on or after november   with earlier adoption encouraged

sfas no 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 
 which allows an irrevocable election to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis  with unrealized gains and losses recognized currently in earnings 
under sfas no 
 the fair value option may only be elected at the time of initial recognition of a financial asset or financial liability or upon the occurrence of certain specified events 
additionally  sfas no 
provides that application of the fair value option must be based on the fair value of an entire financial asset or financial liability and not selected risks inherent in those assets or liabilities 
sfas no 
requires that assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value pursuant to the fair value option be reported in the financial statements in a manner that separates those fair values from the carrying amounts of similar assets and liabilities which are measured using another measurement attribute 
sfas no 
also provides expanded disclosure requirements regarding the effects of electing the fair value option on the financial statements 
sfas no 
is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after november   with early adoption permitted for fiscal years in which interim financial statements have not been issued  provided that all of the provisions of sfas no 
are early adopted as well 
we are currently assessing the financial impact the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest on our notes receivable portfolio  senior subordinated debt  capital leases  and miscellaneous notes is fixed  whereas interest on our primary loan agreements which had a total facility amount of million at december   have a fixed to floating debt ratio of fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
the impact of a one point effective interest rate change on the million balance of variable rate financial instruments at december   on our annual results of operations would be approximately  or approximately per diluted share 
at december   the carrying value of our notes receivable portfolio approximates fair value because the weighted average interest rate on the portfolio approximates current interest rates received on similar notes 
if interest rates on our notes receivable are increased or perceived to be above market rates  the fair market value of our fixed rate notes will decline  which may negatively impact our ability to sell new notes 
the impact of a one point interest rate change on the portfolio at december  could result in a fair value impact of approximately million over the year weighted average remaining life of our notes receivable portfolio 
credit risk we are exposed to on balance sheet credit risk related to our notes receivable 
we are exposed to off balance sheet credit risk related to notes sold 
we offer financing to the buyers of vacation intervals at our resorts 
these buyers generally make a down payment of at least of the purchase price and deliver a promissory note to us for the balance 
the promissory notes generally bear interest at a fixed rate  are payable over a seven year to ten year period  and are secured by a first mortgage on the vacation interval 
we bear the risk of default on these promissory notes 
if a buyer of a vacation interval defaults  we generally must foreclose on the vacation interval and attempt to resell it  the associated marketing  selling  and administrative costs from the original sale are not recovered  and such costs must be incurred again to resell the vacation interval 
although in many cases we may have recourse against a vacation interval buyer for the unpaid price  certain states have laws that limit our ability to recover personal judgments against customers who have defaulted on their loans 
accordingly  we have generally not pursued this remedy 
interest rate risk we have historically derived net interest income from our operating activities because the interest rates we charge our customers who finance the purchase of their vacation intervals have exceeded the interest rates we pay to our senior lenders 
because of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates and our customer receivables bear interest at fixed rates  increases in interest rates will erode the income that we have historically obtained due to this spread and could cause the rate on our borrowings to exceed the rate at which we provide financing to our customers 
to partially offset an increase in interest rates  we have engaged in two interest rate hedging transactions  or derivatives  related to our conduit loan with sf ii  for a notional amount of million at december   that expires between september and march our vfn with sf iv also acts as an interest rate hedge since it contains a provision for an interest rate cap  however there are no amounts outstanding under this line of credit at december  in addition  the series a notes related to our off balance sheet special purpose finance subsidiary  sf iii  with a balance of million at december   bear interest at a blended fixed rate of  and the series a notes related to sf v bear interest at a blended fixed rate of 
availability of funding sources we fund substantially all of our notes receivable  timeshare inventories  and land inventories which we originate or purchased with borrowings through our financing facilities  sales of notes receivable  internally generated funds  and proceeds from public debt and equity offerings 
borrowings are in turn repaid with the proceeds we receive from repayments of such notes receivable 
to the extent that we are not successful in maintaining or replacing existing financings  we would have to curtail our operations or sell assets  thereby having a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
in the first quarter of  we consolidated our debt with textron financial corporation into one revolving loan 
as a result of the amended and restated loan and security agreement  the funding period on the consolidated debt has been extended from june to january  with revised maturity dates of january  for the receivables component and january  on both the acquisition and inventory components 
in addition  the interest rates previously charged have been reduced 
this transaction is described in more detail under the heading subsequent events in note to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f geographic concentration our notes receivable are primarily originated in texas where approximately of vacation interval sales took place in  missouri  illinois  massachusetts  and georgia 
the risk inherent in such concentrations is dependent upon regional and general economic stability  which affects property values and the financial stability of the borrowers 
our vacation interval inventories are concentrated in texas  missouri  illinois  massachusetts  georgia  and florida 
the risk inherent in such concentrations is in the continued popularity of the resort destinations  which affects the marketability of our products and the collection of notes receivable
