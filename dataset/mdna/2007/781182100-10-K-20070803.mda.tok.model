item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and overview ruby tuesday  inc rti  the company  we and or our owns and operates ruby tuesday casual dining restaurants 
we also franchise the ruby tuesday concept in selected domestic and international markets 
as of fiscal year end  we owned and operated ruby tuesday restaurants  located in states and the district of columbia 
we also own or of the equity of each of domestic franchisees  with the balance of the equity in these franchisees being owned by the various operators of the franchise businesses 
as of year end  these franchisees  which we refer to as franchise partnerships  operated restaurants 
we have a contractual right to acquire  at predetermined valuation formulas  the remaining equity of any or all of the franchise partnerships 
our other franchisees  domestic and international  operated restaurants 
in total  rti s franchisees operate restaurants in states and puerto rico and foreign countries 
casual dining  the segment of the restaurant industry in which rti operates  is intensely competitive with respect to prices  services  convenience  locations and the types and quality of food 
we compete with other food service operations  including locally owned restaurants  and other national and regional restaurant chains that offer the same or similar types of services and products as we do 
our industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes  national  regional or local conditions  demographic trends  traffic patterns  and the types  numbers and locations of competing restaurants as well as overall marketing efforts 
there also is significant competition in the restaurant industry for management personnel and for attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for restaurants 
a key performance goal for us is to get more out of existing assets 
to measure our progress towards that goal  we focus on measurements we believe are critical to our growth and progress including  but not limited to  the following same restaurant sales a year over year comparison of sales volumes for restaurants that  in the current year  have been open at least months in order to remove the impact of new openings in comparing the operations of existing restaurants  and average restaurant volumes a per restaurant calculated annual average sales amount  which helps us gauge the continued development of our brand 
generally speaking  growth in average restaurant volumes in excess of same restaurant sales is an indication that newer restaurants are operating with sales levels in excess of the company system average and conversely  when the growth in average restaurant volumes is less than that of same restaurant sales  a general conclusion can be reached that newer restaurants are recording sales less than those of the existing system 
our goal is to increase same restaurant sales or greater per year and to increase average restaurant volumes by  per year towards our long term goal of million in sales per restaurant per year 
we also have strategies to invest wisely in new restaurants which means generating both higher sales as well as higher returns and to maintain the right capital structure to create value for our shareholders 
to that end  we have begun a re imaging initiative intended to move our brand towards a higher quality casual dining restaurant and away from the traditional bar and grill category 
our historical performance in these areas as well as further details regarding our re imaging are discussed throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a section 
our fiscal year ends on the first tuesday following may and  as is the case once every five or six years  we have a week year 
fiscal was a week year 
all other years discussed throughout this md a section contained weeks 
in fiscal  the rd week added million to restaurant sales and operating revenue and to diluted earnings per share in our consolidated statement of income 
we remind you that  in order to best obtain an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the last three fiscal years  this md a section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
references to franchise system revenue contained in this section are presented solely for the purposes of enhancing the investor s understanding of the franchise system  including franchise partnerships and traditional domestic and international franchisees 
franchise system revenue is not included in  and is not  revenue of ruby tuesday  inc however  we believe that such information does provide the investor with a basis for a better understanding of our revenue from franchising activities  which includes royalties  and  in certain cases  support service income and equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated franchises 
franchise system revenue contained in this section is based upon or derived from information that we obtain from our franchisees in our capacity as franchisor

rti s increase in company restaurant sales in fiscal is attributable to the net growth in number of restaurants and higher average restaurant volumes  partially offset by a decrease in same restaurant sales and the addition of a rd week in the prior year 
during the year  we added a net of restaurants 
same restaurant sales for company owned restaurants decreased in fiscal the decrease in same restaurant sales is partially attributable to a leveling of sales growth in the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry as new restaurant growth has outpaced demand  coupled with pressures on the consumer such as rising fuel prices and higher short term interest rates 
rti s increase in company restaurant sales in fiscal is attributable to the net growth in number of restaurants  coupled with an increase in same restaurant sales and higher average restaurant volumes and the addition of a rd week 
management attributes the increase in same restaurant sales to a combination of factors  including a higher check average  driven by an improved menu with slightly higher pricing and better quality products  and a positive response to our media advertising since its introduction in the prior fiscal year 
franchise development and license fees received are recognized when we have substantially performed all material services and the restaurant has opened for business 
franchise royalties generally of monthly sales are recognized as franchise revenue on the accrual basis 
franchise revenue decreased to million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal is due in part to the acquisition of two franchise partnership entities in the current fiscal year and temporarily reduced royalty rates for certain franchisees 
total franchise restaurant sales are shown in the table below 
franchise restaurant sales in thousands a franchise restaurant sales growth percentage a includes sales of all domestic and international franchised ruby tuesday restaurants 
the increase in fiscal franchise restaurant sales is due in part to an increase in average restaurant volumes as a result of an increase in same restaurant sales  partially offset by the acquisition of two franchise partnerships during the current year and the addition of a rd week in the prior year 
the increase in fiscal franchise restaurant sales is due in part to the growth in restaurants in international and domestic markets and an increase in average restaurant volumes as a result of an increase in same restaurant sales and impact of a rd week  partially offset by the acquisition of four franchise partnerships during the prior year 
operating profits the following table sets forth selected restaurant operating data as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated 
all information is derived from our consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report 
restaurant sales and operating revenue franchise revenue total revenue operating costs and expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue cost of merchandise payroll and related costs other restaurant operating costs depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenue loss from specialty restaurant group  llc bankruptcy selling  general and administrative  net of support service fees equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated franchises interest expense  net total operating costs and expenses income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income pre tax income for fiscal  pre tax profit was million or of total revenue  as compared to million or of total revenue  for fiscal the decrease is primarily due to decreases in same restaurant sales coupled with increases  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue  as appropriate  of cost of merchandise  other restaurant operating costs  selling  general and administrative expenses  and interest expense  net 
other factors impacting the change in pre tax income include the impact of the rd week in the prior year  the loss from the specialty restaurant group  llc srg bankruptcy  and increased losses from our equity in earnings of unconsolidated franchises as discussed below 
for fiscal  pre tax profit was million or of total revenue  as compared to million or of total revenue  for fiscal the decrease is primarily due to increases  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue  as appropriate  of cost of merchandise  other restaurant operating costs  advertising contained within selling  general and administrative expenses  interest expense  net  and decreased income from our equity in earnings of unconsolidated franchises as discussed below 
these higher costs were offset by increases in same restaurant sales coupled with the growth in the number of restaurants and lower  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  payroll and related costs and depreciation and amortization 
cost of merchandise cost of merchandise  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased in fiscal primarily due to increased food and beverage costs as a result of product enhancements including items rolled out as part of our fresh program  an increase in the french fry portion size  a higher quality garden bar  and transitioning to premium wines and liquors 
cost of merchandise  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased in fiscal primarily due to increased food costs as a result of burger enhancements such as wheat buns  whole leaf lettuce  apple wood smoked bacon  higher quality pickles and tomatoes  and other product enhancements such as increased portion sizes  and an extended garden bar selection 
payroll and related costs payroll and related costs remained consistent as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue in fiscal with fiscal as increased wages were offset by favorable health claims experience 
wages increased in both the front and back of the house due to the addition of training manager positions in the current year  increased spending on line cooks and food runners  as well as minimum wage increases in several states 
payroll and related costs decreased as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue in fiscal due to the leveraging of certain costs as part of the same restaurant sales growth  labor cost efficiencies resulting from the rollout of kds  the implementation of additional management tools  and improved tracking of hourly employees which resulted in reduced overtime  offset by higher management labor resulting from salary increases given at the beginning of fiscal and minimum wage increases in several states in which the company has restaurant operations 
other restaurant operating costs other restaurant operating costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased in fiscal primarily due to higher utility costs  primarily electricity  higher supplies as a result of upgraded plateware  glassware  and to go containers  and higher building and equipment repairs 
partially offsetting these increases were decreased bad debt expenses associated with certain franchise notes receivable and decreased losses from the sale or impairment of certain properties 
other restaurant operating costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased in fiscal primarily due to higher utility costs  increased bad debt expenses associated with certain franchise notes receivable  higher closing expense due to a lease reserve established upon the closing of an unprofitable restaurant as part of market upgrading  and a million gain recognized in the prior year from the sale of our interest in rt northern illinois franchise  llc 
partially offsetting this increase is the impact of higher same restaurant sales without equivalent increases in other restaurant operating costs  many of which are somewhat fixed in nature 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  remained consistent in fiscal with fiscal as the increase resulting from accelerated depreciation for restaurants remodeled during the current year was offset by reduced depreciation for older leased restaurants as initial leasehold improvements became fully depreciated during the current fiscal year 
depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  decreased in fiscal primarily due to higher average restaurant volumes and reduced depreciation for older leased restaurants as initial leasehold improvements became fully depreciated during the current fiscal year 
loss from specialty restaurant group  llc bankruptcy srg  the company to whom rti sold its american cafe and tia s tex mex restaurants concepts in fiscal  closed restaurants on january  as well as several others earlier in fiscal srg declared chapter bankruptcy on february   leading rti to record a pre tax charge of million during fiscal for leases for which we have primary liability 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding srg leases 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenue  increased in fiscal the increase is attributable to higher stock based compensation expense as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
stock based compensation expense increased million in fiscal to million  net of amounts capitalized 
this increase was partially offset by lower bonus expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenue  increased in fiscal the increase is attributable to higher advertising expense as the company began utilizing cable television advertising at the beginning of fiscal in addition to its previous network television advertising 
in addition  the company began sponsoring certain events as part of its overall marketing strategy during fiscal advertising costs increased million in fiscal to million  net of franchise marketing reimbursements 
bonus expense was also higher in fiscal due to a higher attainment of company performance goals 
these increases were partially offset by lower training payroll due to lower management turnover and efficiencies created by our kitchen display system  and lower supervisor labor due to leveraging of higher sales volumes 
equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated franchises for fiscal  our equity in the losses of unconsolidated franchisees was a million loss as compared to a million income in fiscal  the change primarily due to the acquisition of the orlando franchise in the first quarter of fiscal  coupled with increased losses associated with certain owned franchises due in part to same restaurant sales declines of certain franchisees  primarily in the fourth fiscal quarter  coupled with higher interest expense due to increased debt associated with new restaurant openings and restaurant acquisitions from rti and higher hourly labor costs as a result of minimum wage increases 
for fiscal  our equity in the earnings of unconsolidated franchisees decreased to million from million in fiscal  primarily due to the addition of advertising costs as the domestic franchise system began participating in our national media advertising program  which began including national cable covering the entire country at the beginning of this fiscal year  higher interest expense due to increased debt associated with new restaurant openings and higher interest rates on variable debt  higher utility costs  coupled with the acquisition of a prior owned franchise partnership in the second quarter of fiscal net interest expense net interest expense increased million in fiscal primarily due to higher debt outstanding resulting from the company acquiring million shares of its stock during the year under our on going share repurchase program 
in addition  the increase is attributable to the acquisition of two franchise entities during the current fiscal year  which resulted in more interest expense due to additional assumed debt 
net interest expense increased million in fiscal primarily due to higher debt outstanding resulting from the company acquiring million shares of its stock during the year under our on going share repurchase program 
in addition  the increase is attributable to higher interest rates on variable rate debt and the acquisition of franchise entities during the prior fiscal year  which resulted in more interest expense due to additional higher rate debt and less interest income from domestic franchises 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal was  down from in fiscal the change in the effective rate was primarily due to higher tax credits partially as a result of increased work opportunity tax credits 
these credits coupled with lower pre tax income resulted in our already increased tax credits having a greater impact on the overall tax rate 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was  down from in fiscal the change in the effective rate was primarily due to higher tax credits coupled with lower pre tax income 
liquidity and capital resources rti s cash from operations and excess borrowing capacity allow us to pursue our growth strategies and targeted capital structure 
accordingly  we have established certain well defined priorities for our operating cash flow invest with a focus on getting more from existing assets  invest wisely and prudently in new restaurants with a focus on achieving average restaurant volumes on new restaurants of million or more  continue to make investments in our team members in order to provide superior guest and team satisfaction  and repurchase our common stock in order to maintain our target capital structure and return excess capital to our shareholders and provide further capital return to our shareholders through our dividend program  started in fiscal sources and uses of cash our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations 
the following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years in thousands 
net cash provided by operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash used by financing activities net increase in cash and short term investments we require capital principally for new restaurant construction  investments in technology  equipment  remodeling of existing restaurants  and on occasion for acquisitions of franchisees 
we also require capital to pay dividends to our common stockholders and to repurchase our common stock 
property and equipment expenditures purchased with internally generated cash flows for fiscal   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
in addition during fiscal  we spent million  plus assumed debt  to acquire  directly and through our subsidiaries  the remaining member or limited partnership interests of two franchise partnerships  rt orlando and rt south florida 
these acquisitions added restaurants to the company 
shortly after the end of fiscal  we acquired the remaining partnership interests of rt west palm beach lp rt west palm beach 
further acquisitions  particularly from franchisees in the eastern united states  may occur either during fiscal or thereafter 
capital expenditures for fiscal  exclusive of reimaging costs  are budgeted to be approximately to million based on our expectation that we will open approximately to company owned restaurants in fiscal in addition  we have budgeted to million to reimage our existing restaurants 
we intend to fund capital expenditures for company owned restaurants with cash provided by operations 
we will spend million  plus assume debt  as discussed above to acquire rt west palm beach  which had been a franchise partnership

borrowings and credit facilities on november   rti entered into a million five year revolving credit agreement the credit facility  which  after the most recent amendment discussed below  includes a million swingline subcommitment and a million subcommitment for letters of credit

after consideration of letters of credit outstanding  the company had million available under the credit facility as of june  at june   we had borrowings of million outstanding under the credit facility with an associated floating rate of 
during fiscal  we concluded the private sale of million of non collateralized senior notes the private placement 
the private placement consisted of million with a fixed interest rate of the series a notes and million with a fixed interest rate of the series b notes 
the series a notes and series b notes mature on april  and april   respectively 
during fiscal  we expect to fund operations  capital expansion  any repurchase of common stock or purchase of franchise partnership equity  and the payment of dividends from operating cash flows  our credit facility  and operating leases 
see special note regarding forward looking information below 
share repurchases from time to time our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock as a means to return excess capital to our shareholders 
the timing  price  quantity and manner of the purchases can be made at the discretion of management  depending upon market conditions 
during fiscal we repurchased million shares at an average price of per share 
current year repurchases completed an authorization made in january in january  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of million shares 
during the remainder of fiscal  million of those shares were repurchased 
subsequent to year end  on july   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million shares of rti common stock  bringing the total available for repurchase to million shares as of july  significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments long term financial obligations were as follows as of june  in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years notes payable and other long term debt  including current maturities a revolving credit facility a unsecured senior notes series a and b a interest b operating leases c purchase obligations d pension obligations e total a see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
b amounts represent contractual interest payments on our fixed rate debt instruments 
interest payments on our variable rate revolving credit facility and variable rate notes payable with balances of million and million  respectively  as of june  have been excluded from the amounts shown above  primarily because the balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility  described further in note of the consolidated financial statements  fluctuates daily 
c this amount includes operating leases totaling million for which sublease income of million from franchisees or others is expected 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
d the amounts for purchase obligations include commitments for food items and supplies  construction projects  and other miscellaneous commitments

commercial commitments were as follows as of june  in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years letters of credit a franchise loan guarantees a divestiture guarantees total a includes a million letter of credit which secures franchisees borrowings for construction of restaurants being financed under a franchise loan facility 
the franchise loan guarantees totaling million also shown in the table exclude the guarantee of million for construction to date on the restaurants being financed under the facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
our working capital deficiency and current ratio as of june  were million and  respectively 
as is common in the restaurant industry  we carry current liabilities in excess of current assets because cash a current asset generated from operating activities is reinvested in capital expenditures a long term asset and receivable and inventory levels are generally not significant 
off balance sheet arrangements franchise partnership guarantees since  our franchise partnerships have been offered a credit facility for which we provide a partial guarantee 
the current credit facility  which has been negotiated with various lenders  is a million credit facility to assist franchise partnerships with working capital and operational cash flow requirements 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  on september  we entered into an amendment of this credit facility which extended the term for an additional five years to october  as sponsor of the credit facility  we serve as partial guarantor of the draws made on this revolving line of credit 
although the credit facility allows for individual franchise partnership loan commitments to the end of the credit facility term  all current commitments are for months 
if desired  rti can increase the amount of the facility by up to million to a total of million or  reduce the amount of the facility 
the amount guaranteed under this program totaled million as of june  prior to july   rti also had an arrangement with a third party lender whereby we could choose  in our sole discretion  to partially guarantee specific loans for new franchisee restaurant development the cancelled facility 
on july   rti terminated the cancelled facility and notified this third party lender that it would no longer enter into additional guarantee arrangements 
rti will honor the partial guarantees of the three loans to franchise partnerships that were in existence as of the termination of the credit facility 
should payments be required under the cancelled facility  rti has certain rights to acquire the operating restaurants after the third party debt is paid 
this program had remaining outstanding guarantees of million at june  also in july  rti entered into a new program  similar to the cancelled facility  with a different third party lender the franchise development facility 
under the franchise development facility  the company s potential guarantee liability was reduced  and the program included better terms and lower rates for the franchise partnerships as compared to the cancelled facility 
the franchise development facility expired on july   although the guarantees outstanding at that time survived the expiration of the arrangement 
rti had a guarantee of million outstanding under this program as of june  as consideration for providing these guarantees  we received million in fiscal and million in fiscal divestiture guarantees on november   the company completed the sale of all of its american cafe including l n seafood and tia s restaurants to srg  a limited liability company 
a number of these restaurants were located on leased properties 
rti remains primarily liable on certain american cafe and tia s leases that were subleased to srg and contingently liable on others 
srg  on december   sold its tia s restaurants to an unrelated entity and  as part of the transaction  further subleased certain tia s properties 
during the second quarter of fiscal  rti became aware that the third party to whom srg had sold the tia s restaurants had defaulted on four subleases 
claims have been asserted against the company and srg for unpaid rent  property taxes and similar charges 
during the fiscal quarter ended december   the third party owner declared chapter bankruptcy 
as of june   rti remains primarily liable for two tia s leases  which have remaining cash payments due of approximately million  and contingently liable for five other tia s leases  which have remaining cash payments of approximately million 
rti has recorded an estimated liability of million based on the unsettled tia s claims made to date 
an additional million is recorded as of june  within our liability for deferred escalating minimum rents for rti leases sub leased by srg to tia s 
during fiscal  rti learned that srg had defaulted on  or was late at least once in paying monthly rent on  a number of its restaurant leases for which rti has primary liability 
on january   srg closed restaurants  of which were located on properties sub leased from rti 
four other srg restaurants were closed in calendar srg filed for chapter bankruptcy on february  as of june   rti had million recorded within our liability for deferred escalating minimum rents for srg leases for which we remain primarily liable 
these srg leases include nine restaurants closed within fiscal and three restaurants scheduled by srg to remain open at the current time 
scheduled cash payments for rent remaining on these leases at june  totaled million and million  respectively 
because many of these restaurants were located in malls  rti may be liable for other charges such as common area maintenance and property taxes 
in addition to the scheduled remaining payments  we believe srg to be million behind in rent and related payments on rti leases as of june  following the closing of the srg restaurants in january  rti performed an analysis of the now closed properties in order to estimate the lease liability to be incurred from the closings 
based upon the analysis performed  a charge of million was recorded during the fiscal quarter ended march  in addition to the million liability for deferred escalating minimum rent discussed above  as of june   rti has recorded an estimated liability of million based on the nine srg unsettled claims to date 
one of the remaining leases was settled shortly after year end for million  which equals the amount recorded at june  see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and noted below  rti has certain divestiture guarantees with morrison fresh cooking  inc mfc and morrison health care  inc 
mhc which arose in in connection with the distribution of mfc subsequently acquired by piccadilly cafeterias  inc  or piccadilly and mhc subsequently acquired by compass group  plc  or compass businesses 
contingent liabilities resulting from these guarantees include payments due to mfc and mhc employees retiring under two non qualified defined benefit plans which existed at the time of the distribution the non qualified pension plans  or corresponding replacement plans established by mfc and mhc at the time of distribution  for their proportionate share of any accrued benefit that may have been earned under the non qualified pension plans as of the distribution date and for payments due on six named workers compensation claims 
additionally  as a sponsor of the morrison restaurants inc retirement plan the retirement plan  we  along with mfc and mhc  can be held responsible for benefits due to all of the retirement plan s participants 
on october   piccadilly filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in the united states bankruptcy court in fort lauderdale  florida 
in addition  on march   piccadilly withdrew as a sponsor of the retirement plan with the approval of the bankruptcy court 
as a result of the piccadilly bankruptcy  the amounts we expect to pay represent of the total amounts due as we expect to share liabilities equally with mhc  which is also contingently liable 
since fiscal  we have recorded within our pension liabilities amounts we believe sufficient to reflect the divestiture guarantees for which mfc was originally responsible under the divestiture guarantee agreements 
these amounts were determined in consultation with the plans actuary  and assumed no recovery from the bankruptcy proceeding 
as of june   we have received three partial settlements of the piccadilly bankruptcy  million in both december and  and million in december we hope to recover further amounts upon final settlement of the bankruptcy 
the actual amount we may be ultimately required to pay could be lower if there is any further recovery in the bankruptcy proceeding  or could be higher if more valid participants are identified or if actuarial assumptions are ultimately proven inaccurate 
see special note regarding forward looking information below 
our contingent liability relative to mhc is estimated to be million at june   and includes mhc s share of the piccadilly employee benefit plan liability  along with the amounts for which we would be liable relative to the employees of mhc 
we currently do not anticipate having to pay any amounts on behalf of mhc due to our perception of mhc s financial strength and accordingly no amounts have been recorded relative to our mhc contingent liability 
we have an employment agreement with samuel e 
beall  iii  whereby he has agreed to serve as chief executive officer of the company until june  in accordance with the agreement  mr 
beall is compensated at a base salary adjusted annually based on various company or market factors and is entitled to an annual bonus opportunity and a long term incentive compensation program  which currently includes stock option and restricted stock grants and life insurance coverage 
the employment agreement also provides for certain severance payments to be made in the event of a termination other than for cause  or a change in control  the circumstances of which are defined in the agreement 
as of june   the total of the potential liability for severance payments with regard to the employment agreement was approximately million 
pension plans funded status as discussed further in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted sfas  employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r  effective with our june  financial statements 
as previously mentioned  rti  and previously mhc  is a sponsor of the retirement plan 
the retirement plan had been established by the company  at a time when our name was morrison restaurants inc morrison  to provide retirement benefits to qualifying employees of morrison 
under the retirement plan  participants are entitled to receive benefits based upon salary and length of service 
the retirement plan was amended as of december   so that no additional benefits will accrue and no new participants will enter the retirement plan after that date 
assets and obligations attributable to mhc participants  as well as participants formerly with mfc  who were allocated to compass following piccadilly s bankruptcy  were spun out of the retirement plan effective june  following compass s withdrawal  rti remained the sole sponsor of the retirement plan 
our total contributions to the retirement plan approximated million  million  and million  in fiscal   and  respectively 
rti contributions to the retirement plan for fiscal are projected to be million 
rti also sponsors two additional pension plans  the executive supplemental pension plan and the management retirement plan 
although these plans are legally considered to be unfunded  the company does provide a source for the payment of benefits under these two plans in the form of company owned life insurance policies 
the cash value of these policies was million at june  the management retirement plan was amended effective june  such that no additional benefits would accrue and no new participants may enter the plan after that date 
as of our march  measurement date  rti s three pension plans had a total projected benefit obligation pbo of million and an accumulated benefit obligation abo of million 
the combined fair value of plan assets as of the end of fiscal  including the company owned life insurance policies mentioned above was approximately million 
as a result of the underfunded status of the three plans relative to the combined pbo and the adoption of sfas  we have recorded a million reduction to shareholders equity net of tax of million as of june  the pbo and abo reflect the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees 
the pbo incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels while the abo reflects only current compensation levels 
due to the relatively long time period over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid  our pbo and abo are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates 
we measured our pbo and abo using a discount rate of at both march  and march  we believe our assumption of the expected rate of return on plan assets to be appropriate given the composition of plan assets and historical market returns thereon 
we will continue to use the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption for the determination of pension expense in fiscal assuming no further recoveries from the piccadilly bankruptcy  we expect pension expense to increase by million in fiscal during  congress passed the pension protection act of the act with the stated purpose of improving the funding of american s private pension plans 
the act introduces new funding requirements for qualified defined benefit pension plans  introduces benefit limitations for certain under funded plans and raises tax deduction limits for contributions 
the act applies to pension plan years beginning after december  we have preliminarily reviewed the provisions of the act to determine the impact to the company 
required funding for the retirement plan under the act will be dependent upon many factors including our future funded status as well as discretionary contributions we may choose to make 
based upon this preliminary review as well as the current funded status of the retirement plan relative to our level of annual operating cash flows  we do not believe that required contributions under the act would materially impact our operating cash flows in any one given year 
additonally  we do not believe that the underfunded status of all three of our rti pension plans will materially affect our financial position or cash flows in fiscal or in future years 
we have included known and expected increases in our pension expense as well as future expected plan contributions in our annual budgets and outlook 
see special note regarding forward looking information below 
dividends during fiscal  our board of directors approved a dividend policy as an additional means of returning capital to rti s shareholders 
this policy has historically called for payment of semi annual dividends of per share 
on july   our board of directors approved a plan to increase our semi annual dividend from to per share 
in accordance with this policy  we paid dividends of million in fiscal the payment of a dividend in any particular future period and the actual amount thereof remain  however  at the discretion of the board of directors and no assurance can be given that dividends will be paid in the future 
additionally  our credit facilities contain certain limitations on the payment of dividends 
see special note regarding forward looking information below 
critical accounting policies our md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment changes 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
share based employee compensation beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  we account for share based compensation in accordance with sfas r 
as required by sfas r  share based compensation expense is estimated for equity awards at fair value at the grant date 
we determine the fair value of equity awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including the expected dividend yield  stock price volatility and life of the award 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of share based employee compensation 
impairment of long lived assets each quarter we evaluate the carrying value of any individual restaurant when the cash flows of such restaurant have deteriorated and we believe the probability of continued operating and cash flow losses indicate that the net book value of the restaurant may not be recoverable 
in performing the review for recoverability  we consider the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the restaurant and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying value of the restaurant  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the net book value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
otherwise  an impairment loss is not recognized 
fair value is based upon estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use through the expected disposal date and the expected salvage value 
in the instance of a potential sale of a restaurant in a refranchising transaction  the expected purchase price is used as the estimate of fair value 
restaurants open for less than five quarters are considered new and are excluded from our impairment review 
we believe this approach provides sufficient time to establish the presence of the restaurant in the market and build a customer base 
approximately of our restaurants have been open for less than five quarters and have not been evaluated for potential impairment 
if a restaurant that has been open for at least five quarters shows negative cash flow results  we prepare a plan to reverse the negative performance 
under our policies  recurring or projected annual negative cash flow signals a potential impairment 
both qualitative and quantitative information are considered when evaluating for potential impairments 
at june   we had six restaurants that had been open more than five quarters with rolling month negative cash flows 
of these six restaurants  one had previously been impaired to salvage value and was closed subsequent to our fiscal year end 
we reviewed the plans to improve cash flows at each of the other five restaurants and concluded that no impairment existed as of june  the combined month cash flow loss at these five restaurants for which no impairment had previously been recognized  was approximately million 
should sales at these restaurants not improve within a reasonable period of time  further impairment charges are possible 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows  including cash flows from continuing use  terminal value  closure costs  salvage value  and sublease income 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from our estimates 
allowance for doubtful notes and interest income we follow a systematic methodology each quarter in our analysis of franchise and other notes receivable in order to estimate losses inherent at the balance sheet date 
a detailed analysis of our loan portfolio involves reviewing the following for each significant borrower terms including interest rate  original note date  payoff date  and principal and interest start dates  note amounts including the original balance  current balance  associated debt guarantees  and total exposure  and other relevant information including whether the borrower is making timely interest  principal  royalty and support payments  the borrower s debt coverage ratios  the borrower s current financial condition and sales trends  the borrower s additional borrowing capacity  and  as appropriate  management s judgment on the quality of the borrower s operations 
based on the results of this analysis  the allowance for doubtful notes is adjusted as appropriate 
no portion of the allowance for doubtful notes is allocated to guarantees 
in the event that collection is deemed to be an issue  a number of actions to resolve the issue are possible  including modification to the terms of payment of franchise fees or note obligations or a restructuring of the borrower s debt to better position the borrower to fulfill its obligations 
at june  the allowance for doubtful notes was million 
included in the allowance for doubtful notes is million allocated to the million of debt due from five franchisees that  for the most recent reporting period  have either reported coverage ratios below the required levels with certain of their third party debt  or reported ratios above the required levels but for an insufficient amount of time 
with the exception of amounts borrowed under one current and two former credit facilities for franchise partnerships see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information  the third party debt referred to above is not guaranteed by rti 
the company believes that payments are being made by these franchisees in accordance with the terms of these debts 
we recognize interest income on notes receivable when earned which sometimes precedes collection 
a number of our franchise notes have  since the inception of these notes  allowed for the deferral of interest during the first one to three years 
all franchisees that issued outstanding notes to us are currently paying interest on these notes 
it is our policy to cease accruing interest income and recognize interest on a cash basis when we determine that the collection of interest is doubtful 
the same analysis noted above for doubtful notes is utilized in determining whether to cease recognizing interest income and thereafter record interest payments on the cash basis 
lease obligations the company leases a significant number of its restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
our lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
there is potential for variability in our rent holiday period which begins on the possession date and ends on the earlier of the restaurant open date or the commencement of rent payments 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater preopening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period 
for leases that contain rent escalations  we record the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on the straight line basis over the term of the lease including the rent holiday period beginning upon possession of the premises  and we record the difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight line rent as deferred escalating minimum rent 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments  called contingent rents  when the associated restaurants sales volumes exceed agreed upon levels 
we recognize contingent rental expense in annual as well as interim periods prior to the achievement of the specified target that triggers the contingent rental expense  provided that achievement of that target is considered probable 
estimated liability for self insurance we self insure a portion of our current and past losses from workers compensation and general liability claims 
we have stop loss insurance for individual claims for workers compensation and general liability in excess of stated loss amounts 
insurance liabilities are recorded based on third party actuarial estimates of the ultimate incurred losses  net of payments made 
the estimates themselves are based on standard actuarial techniques that incorporate both the historical loss experience of the company and supplemental information as appropriate 
the analysis performed in calculating the estimated liability is subject to various assumptions including  but not limited to  a the quality of historical loss and exposure information  b the reliability of historical loss experience to serve as a predictor of future experience  c the reasonableness of insurance trend factors and governmental indices as applied to the company  and d projected payrolls and revenue 
as claims develop  the actual ultimate losses may differ from actuarial estimates 
therefore  an analysis is performed quarterly to determine if modifications to the accrual are required 
income tax valuation allowances and tax accruals we record deferred tax assets for various items 
as of june   we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the future tax deductions attributable to our deferred tax assets will be realized and therefore no valuation allowance has been recorded 
as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by federal and state tax authorities 
we record appropriate accruals for potential exposures should a taxing authority take a position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these accruals  including interest thereon  on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events that may impact our ultimate tax liability

known events  uncertainties and trends financial strategy and stock repurchase plan our financial strategy is to utilize a prudent amount of debt  including operating leases  letters of credit  and any guarantees  to minimize the weighted average cost of capital while allowing financial flexibility and maintaining the equivalent of an investment grade bond rating 
this strategy periodically allows us to repurchase rti common stock 
during the year ended june   we repurchased million shares of rti common stock for a total purchase price of million 
the total number of remaining shares authorized to be repurchased  as of june   is approximately million 
this amount reflects a million share repurchase authorization approved by our board of directors on january  but does not reflect a million share repurchase authorization approved by our board of directors subsequent to year end  on july  to the extent not funded with cash from operating activities and proceeds from franchising and development agreements our agreements with franchise partnerships allow us to purchase an additional equity interest for a specified price 
we have chosen to exercise that option in situations in which we expect to earn a return similar to or better than that which we expect when we invest in new restaurants 
during fiscal and  we did not exercise our right to acquire an additional equity interest in any franchise partnerships 
we currently have a ownership in seven of our franchise partnerships which collectively operated ruby tuesday restaurants at june  on june   we transferred our interest in the rt michigan franchise  llc rt michigan franchise partnership  which operated ruby tuesday restaurants as of june   to the franchisee for no consideration 
equity method losses recorded by the company attributable to this franchisee totaled million in fiscal our franchise agreements with the franchise partnerships allow us to purchase all remaining equity interests beyond the or we already own  for an amount to be calculated based upon a predetermined valuation formula 
on june   we acquired the remaining partnership interests of rt west palm beach  bringing our equity interest in that franchise to 
at the time of acquisition rt west palm beach operated ruby tuesday restaurants 
we may choose to sell existing restaurants or exercise our rights to acquire an additional equity interest in franchise partnerships in fiscal and beyond 
see special note regarding forward looking information below 
fiscal year rti s fiscal will contain weeks and end on june  fiscal year contained weeks  while fiscal year contained weeks 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food  labor  supplies  utilities  real estate and construction costs could adversely impact our operating results 
historically  we have been able to recover inflationary cost increases through increased menu prices coupled with more efficient purchasing practices and productivity improvements 
competitive pressures may limit our ability to completely recover such cost increases 
historically  the effect of inflation has not significantly impacted our net income 
special note regarding forward looking information the foregoing section contains various forward looking statements  which represent the company s expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including one or more of the following future financial performance and restaurant growth both company owned and franchised  future capital expenditures  future borrowings and repayment of debt  payment of dividends  stock repurchases  and restaurant and franchise acquisitions and re franchises 
the company cautions the reader that a number of important factors and uncertainties could  individually or in the aggregate  cause actual results to differ materially from those included in the forward looking statements  including  without limitation  the following changes in promotional  couponing and advertising strategies  guests acceptance of changes in menu items  changes in our guests disposable income  consumer spending trends and habits  mall traffic trends  increased competition in the restaurant market  weather conditions in the regions in which company owned and franchised restaurants are operated  guests acceptance of the company s development prototypes and remodeled restaurants  laws and regulations affecting labor and employee benefit costs  including potential further increases in federally mandated minimum wage  costs and availability of food and beverage inventory  the company s ability to attract qualified managers  franchisees and team members  changes in the availability and cost of capital  impact of adoption of new accounting standards  impact of food borne illnesses resulting from an outbreak at either ruby tuesday or other restaurant concepts  effects of actual or threatened future terrorist attacks in the united states  significant fluctuations in energy prices  and general economic conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
the interest rate charged on our credit facility can vary based on the interest rate option we choose to utilize 
our options for the rate are the base rate or libo rate plus an applicable margin 
the base rate is defined to be the higher of the issuing bank s prime lending rate or the federal funds rate plus 
the applicable margin for the libo rate based option is a percentage ranging from to 
as of june   the total amount of outstanding debt subject to interest rate fluctuations was million 
a hypothetical basis point change in short term interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of million per year  assuming a consistent capital structure 
many of the ingredients used in the products we sell in our restaurants are commodities that are subject to unpredictable price volatility 
this volatility may be due to factors outside our control such as weather and seasonality 
we attempt to minimize the effect of price volatility by negotiating fixed price contracts for the supply of key ingredients 
historically  and subject to competitive market conditions  we have been able to mitigate the negative impact of price volatility through adjustments to average check or menu mix
