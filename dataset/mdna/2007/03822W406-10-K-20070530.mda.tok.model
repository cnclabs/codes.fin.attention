item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
backlog our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for the delivery of products 
quantities of our products to be delivered and delivery schedules are frequently revised to reflect changes in customers needs  customer orders generally can be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
for these reasons  our backlog as of any particular date is not representative of actual sales for any succeeding period  and therefore  we believe that backlog is not necessarily a good indicator of future revenue 
competition in the communications ic markets  we compete primarily against companies such as lsi  broadcom  intel  mindspeed  pmc sierra  and vitesse 
our principal competitors in the raid controller market are adaptec  areca  hewlett packard  lsi  and promise 
in the embedded processor market  we compete with other large technology companies such as freescale semiconductor  ibm and intel 
in addition  certain of our customers and potential customers have internal ic or storage design or manufacturing capability with which we compete 
the communications ic and storage markets are highly competitive and are subject to rapid technological change 
the nature of the communications ic market is that design cycles are often measured in years 
as such  an ic supplier s timing of delivery to market is critical as once an ic supplier s product is designed into a customer s products  the ic supplier can often enjoy sales of the product for several years 
conversely  if a supplier misses a design cycle or develops an uncompetitive product  the supplier may never generate significant revenues from the product 
we typically face competition at the design stage when our customers are selecting which components to use in their next generation equipment 
in the storage market  our products can be qualified by customers more quickly than in the ic market  and our storage products are generally distinguished by a combination of pricing  features and reliability 
we believe that the principal factors of competition for the markets we serve include product performance  quality  reliability  integration  price  and time to market  as well as our reputation and level of customer support 
our ability to successfully compete in these markets depends on our ability to design and subcontract the manufacture of new products that implement new technologies and gain end market acceptance in a time efficient and cost effective manner 
proprietary rights we rely in part on patents to protect our intellectual property 
we have been issued approximately patents  which principally cover certain aspects of the design and architecture of our ic and enterprise storage products 
in addition  we have over inventions in various stages of the patenting process in the united states and abroad 
there can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications or any future applications will be approved  or that any issued patents will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties or that if challenged  will be found to be valid or enforceable  or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 
there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products or processes  duplicate our products or processes or design around any patents that may be issued to us 
to protect our intellectual property  we also rely on a combination of mask work protection under the federal semiconductor chip protection act of  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements 
as a general matter  the semiconductor and enterprise storage industries are characterized by substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in the past we have been  and in the future may be  notified that we may be infringing on the intellectual property rights of third parties 
we have certain indemnification obligations to customers with respect to the infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products 
there can be no assurance that infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers or end users of our products resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted in the future or that such assertions  if proven to be true  will not materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
in the event of any adverse ruling in any such matter  we could be required to pay substantial damages  which could include treble damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain a license under the intellectual property rights of the third party claiming infringement 
there can be no assurance that a license would be available on reasonable terms or at all 
any limitations on our ability to market our products  any delays and costs associated with redesigning our products or payments of license fees to third parties or any failure by us to develop or license a substitute technology on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
environmental matters we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals that were used in our manufacturing process 
any failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines  the suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
such regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations or clean up prior discharges 
since  we have been named as a potentially responsible party prp along with a large number of other companies that used omega chemical corporation in whittier  california to handle and dispose of certain hazardous waste material 
we are a member of a large group of prps that has agreed to fund certain remediation efforts at the omega chemical site  which efforts are ongoing 
for more information see our risk factor titled we could incur substantial fines or litigation costs associated with our storage  use and disposal of hazardous materials in item a below

risk factors 
risk factors before deciding to invest in us or to maintain or increase your investment  you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec 
we update our descriptions of the risks and uncertainties facing us in our periodic reports filed with the sec 
the risks and uncertainties described below and in our other filings are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business 
if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose your investment 
our operating results may fluctuate because of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
if our operating results are below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  then the market price of our common stock could decline 
some of the factors that affect our quarterly and annual results  but which are difficult to control or predict are communications  information technology and semiconductor industry conditions  fluctuations in the timing and amount of customer requests for product shipments  the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of orders by customers  including as a result of slowing demand for our products or our customers products or over ordering of our products or our customers products  changes in the mix of products that our customers buy  the gain or loss of one or more key customers or their key customers  or significant changes in the financial condition of one or more of our key customers or their key customers  our ability to introduce  certify and deliver new products and technologies on a timely basis  the announcement or introduction of products and technologies by our competitors  competitive pressures on selling prices  the ability of our customers to obtain components from their other suppliers  market acceptance of our products and our customers products  fluctuations in manufacturing output  yields or other problems or delays in the fabrication  assembly  testing or delivery of our products or our customers products  increases in the costs of products or discontinuance of products by suppliers  the availability of external foundry capacity  contract manufacturing services  purchased parts and raw materials including packaging substrates  problems or delays that we and our foundries may face in shifting the design and manufacture of our future generations of ic products to smaller geometry process technologies and in achieving higher levels of design and device integration  the amounts and timing of costs associated with warranties and product returns  the amounts and timing of investments in research and development  the amounts and timing of the costs associated with payroll taxes related to stock option exercises or settlement of restricted stock units  costs associated with acquisitions and the integration of acquired companies  products and technologies  the impact of potential one time charges related to purchased intangibles  our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies  products and technologies  the impact on interest income of a significant use of our cash for an acquisition  stock repurchase or other purpose  the effects of changes in interest rates or credit worthiness on the value and yield of our short term investment portfolio  costs associated with compliance with applicable environmental  other governmental or industry regulations including costs to redesign products to comply with those regulations or lost revenue due to failure to comply in a timely manner  the effects of changes in accounting standards  including the rule requiring the recognition of expense related to share based payments to employees  such as grants of stock options and restricted stock units  costs associated with litigation  including without limitation  attorney fees  litigation judgments or settlements  relating to the use or ownership of intellectual property or other claims arising out of our operations  our ability to identify  hire and retain senior management and other key personnel  the effects of war  acts of terrorism or global threats  such as disruptions in general economic activity and changes in logistics and security arrangements  and general economic conditions 
our business  financial condition and operating results would be harmed if we do not achieve anticipated revenues 
we can have revenue shortfalls for a variety of reasons  including the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders  declines in the average selling prices of our products  delays when our customers are transitioning from old products to new products a decrease in demand for our products or our customers products  a decline in the financial condition or liquidity of our customers or their customers  delays in the availability of our products or our customers products  the failure of our products to be qualified in our customers systems or certified by our customers  excess inventory of our products at our customers resulting in a reduction in their order patterns as they work through the excess inventory of our products  fabrication  test  product yield  or assembly constraints for our products that adversely affect our ability to meet our production obligations  the failure of one of our subcontract manufacturers to perform its obligations to us  our failure to successfully integrate acquired companies  products and technologies  and shortages of raw materials or production capacity constraints that lead our suppliers to allocate available supplies or capacity to other customers  which may disrupt our ability to meet our production obligations 
our business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules 
customer orders typically can be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
because we do not have substantial non cancellable backlog  we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
customer orders for our products typically have non standard lead times  which makes it difficult for us to predict revenues and plan inventory levels and production schedules 
if we are unable to plan inventory levels and production schedules effectively  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed 
from time to time  in response to anticipated long lead times to obtain inventory and materials from our outside contract manufacturers  suppliers and foundries  we may order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand 
this advance ordering has in the past and may in the future result in excess inventory levels or unanticipated inventory write downs if expected orders fail to materialize  or other factors render our products less marketable 
if we are forced to hold excess inventory or we incur unanticipated inventory write downs  our financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed 
our expense levels are relatively fixed and are based on our expectations of future revenues 
we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
changes to production volumes and impact of overhead absorption may result in a decline in our financial condition or liquidity 
our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the technology sector and the internet 
the technology equipment industry is cyclical and has experienced significant and extended downturns in the past 
a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on the continued growth of the technology sector and the internet 
we sell our communications ic products primarily to communications equipment manufacturers that in turn sell their equipment to customers that depend on the growth of the internet 
oems and other customers that buy our storage products are similarly dependent on continued internet growth and information technology spending 
if there is an economic slowdown or reduction in capital spending  our business  operating results  and financial condition may be materially harmed 
the loss of one or more key customers  the diminished demand for our products from a key customer  or the failure to obtain certifications from a key customer or its distribution channel could significantly reduce our revenues and profits 
a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues in any particular period 
we have no long term volume purchase commitments from our key customers 
one or more of our key customers may discontinue operations as a result of consolidation  liquidation or otherwise 
continued reductions  delays and cancellation of orders from our key customers or the loss of one or more key customers could significantly further reduce our revenues and profits 
we cannot assure you that our current customers will continue to place orders with us  that orders by existing customers will continue at current or historical levels or that we will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
our ability to maintain or increase sales to key customers and attract new significant customers is subject to a variety of factors  including customers may stop incorporating our products into their own products with limited notice to us and may suffer little or no penalty  customers or prospective customers may not incorporate our products in their future product designs  design wins with customers may not result in sales to such customers  the introduction of new products by customers may be later or less successful in the market than planned  we may successfully design a product to customer specifications but the customer may not be successful in the market  sales of customer product lines using our products may rapidly decline or the product lines may be phased out  our agreements with customers typically are non exclusive and do not require them to purchase a minimum amount of our products  many of our customers have pre existing relationships with current or potential competitors that may cause them to switch from our products to competing products  some of our oem customers may develop products internally that would replace our products  we may not be able to successfully develop relationships with additional network equipment vendors  our relationships with some of our larger customers may deter other potential customers who compete with these customers from buying our products  the impact of terminating certain sales representatives or sales personnel  and the continued viability of these customers 
the occurrence of any one of the factors above could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  before we can sell our storage products to an oem  either directly or through the oem s associated distribution channel  that oem must certify our products 
the certification process can take up to months 
this process requires the commitment of oem personnel and test equipment  and we compete with other suppliers for these resources 
any delays in obtaining these certifications or any failure to obtain these certifications would adversely affect our ability to sell our storage products 
there is no guarantee that design wins will become actual orders and sales 
a design win occurs when a customer or prospective customer notifies us that our product has been selected to be integrated with the customer s product 
there can be delays of several months or more between the design win and when a customer initiates actual orders of our product 
following a design win  we will commit significant resources to the integration of our product into the customer s product before receiving the initial order 
receipt of an initial order from a customer  however  is dependent on a number of factors  including the success of the customer s product  and cannot be guaranteed the design win may never result in an actual order or sale 
any significant order cancellations or order deferrals could cause unplanned inventory growth resulting in excess inventory which may adversely affect our operating results 
our customers may increase orders during periods of product shortages or cancel orders if their inventories are too high 
major inventory corrections by our customers are not uncommon and can last for significant periods of time and affect demand for our product 
customers may also cancel or delay orders in anticipation of new products or for other reasons cancellations or deferrals could cause us to hold excess inventory  which could reduce our profit margins by  reduced sales prices  inventory write downs and increased product obsolescence 
inventory fluctuations could affect our results of operations and restrict our ability to fund our operations 
inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements 
we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products to a customer 
if a customer refuses to accept shipped products or does not pay for these products  we could miss future revenue projections or incur significant charges against our income  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our products typically have lengthy design cycles 
a customer may decide to cancel or change its product plans  which could cause us to lose anticipated sales 
after we have developed and delivered a product to a customer  the customer will usually test and evaluate our product prior to designing its own equipment to incorporate our product 
our customers may need three to more than six months to test  evaluate and adopt our product and an additional three to more than nine months to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates our product 
due to this lengthy design cycle  we may experience significant delays from the time we increase our operating expenses and make investments in inventory until the time that we generate revenue from these products 
it is possible that we may never generate any revenue from these products after incurring such expenditures 
even if a customer selects our product to incorporate into its equipment  we cannot assure you that the customer will ultimately market and sell its equipment or that such efforts by our customer will be successful 
the delays inherent in our lengthy design cycle increase the risk that a customer will decide to cancel or change its product plans 
such a cancellation or change in plans by a customer could cause us to lose sales that we had anticipated 
while our design cycles are typically long  some of our product life cycles tend to be short as a result of the rapidly changing technology environment in which we operate 
as a result  the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not generate material revenue for us  and from time to time  we may need to write off excess and obsolete inventory 
if we incur significant marketing expenses and investments in inventory in the future that we are not able to recover  and we are not able to mitigate those expenses  our operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions but still hold higher cost products in inventory  our operating results would be harmed 
an important part of our strategy is to continue our focus on the markets for communications and storage equipment 
if we are unable to further expand our share of these markets  our revenues may not grow and could decline 
our markets frequently undergo transitions in which products rapidly incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry wide basis 
if our products are unable to support the new features or performance levels required by oems in these markets  or if our products fail to be certified by oems  we would lose business from an existing or potential customer and could not have the opportunity to compete for new design wins or certification until the next product transition occurs 
if we fail to develop products with required features or performance standards  or if we experience a delay as short as a few months in certifying or bringing a new product to market  or if our customers fail to achieve market acceptance of their products  our revenues could be significantly reduced for a substantial period 
we expect a significant portion of our revenues to continue to be derived from sales of products based on current  widely accepted transmission standards 
if the communications market evolves to new standards  we may not be able to successfully design and manufacture new products that address the needs of our customers or gain substantial market acceptance 
customers for our products generally have substantial technological capabilities and financial resources 
some customers have traditionally used these resources to internally develop their own products 
the future prospects for our products in these markets are dependent upon our customers acceptance of our products as an alternative to their internally developed products 
future prospects also are dependent upon acceptance of third party sourcing for products as an alternative to in house development 
network equipment vendors may in the future continue to use internally developed components 
they also may decide to develop or acquire components  technologies or products that are similar to  or that may be substituted for  our products 
if our network equipment vendor customers fail to accept our products as an alternative  if they develop or acquire the technology to develop such components internally rather than purchase our products  or if we are otherwise unable to develop strong relationships with network equipment vendors  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
our industry and markets are subject to consolidation  which may result in stronger competitors  fewer customers and reduced demand 
there has been industry consolidation among communications ic companies  network equipment companies and telecommunications companies in the past 
we expect this consolidation to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their positions in evolving markets 
consolidation may result in stronger competitors  fewer customers and reduced demand  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
our operating results are subject to fluctuations because we rely heavily on international sales 
international sales account for a significant part of our revenues and may account for an increasing portion of our future revenues 
the revenues we derive from international sales may be subject to certain risks  including foreign currency exchange fluctuations  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  timing and availability of export licenses  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collections  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  difficulties in managing distributors  difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals for communications and other products  reduced or uncertain protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  longer payment cycles to collect accounts receivable in some countries  the burden of complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
we are subject to risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating to the import or export of high technology products 
we cannot predict whether quotas  duties  taxes or other charges or restrictions upon the importation or exportation of our products will be implemented by the united states or other countries 
because sales of our products have been denominated to date primarily in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar could increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales and profitability in that country 
future international activity may result in increased foreign currency denominated sales 
gains and losses on the conversion to united states dollars of accounts receivable  accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations 
some of our customer purchase orders and agreements are governed by foreign laws  which may differ significantly from laws in the united states 
as a result  our ability to enforce our rights under such agreements may be limited compared with our ability to enforce our rights under agreements governed by laws in the united states 
our cash and cash equivalents and portfolio of short term investments are exposed to certain market risks 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types of instruments and maturities 
these securities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
our investment portfolio is exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and credit ratings of the issuers  as well as to the risks of default by the issuers 
substantially all of these securities are subject to interest rate and credit rating risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase or one of the issuers credit ratings is reduced 
increases in interest rates or decreases in the credit worthiness of one or more of the issuers in our investment portfolio could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
our restructuring activities could result in management distractions  operational disruptions and other difficulties 
over the past several years  we have initiated several restructuring activities in an effort to reduce operating costs 
employees whose positions were eliminated in connection with these restructuring plans may seek future employment with our customers or competitors 
although all employees are required to sign a confidentiality agreement with us at the time of hire  we cannot assure you that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 
any additional restructuring efforts could divert the attention of our management away from our operations  harm our reputation and increase our expenses 
we cannot assure you that we will not undertake additional restructuring activities  that any future restructuring efforts will be successful  or that we will be able to realize the cost savings and other anticipated benefits from our previous or future restructuring plans 
in addition  if we continue to reduce our workforce  it may adversely impact our ability to respond rapidly to any new growth opportunities 
our markets are subject to rapid technological change  so our success depends heavily on our ability to develop and introduce new products 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving and competing industry standards  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  increased integration with other functions  long design and sales cycles  short product life cycles  and intense competition 
to develop new products for the communications  storage or other technology markets  we must develop  gain access to and use leading technologies in a cost effective and timely manner and continue to develop technical and design expertise 
we must have our products designed into our customers future products and maintain close working relationships with key customers in order to develop new products that meet customers changing needs 
we must respond to changing industry standards  trends towards increased integration and other technological changes on a timely and cost effective basis 
our pursuit of technological advances may require substantial time and expense and may ultimately prove unsuccessful 
if we are not successful in introducing such advances  we may be unable to timely bring to market new products and our revenues will suffer 
many of our products are based on industry standards that are continually evolving 
our ability to compete in the future will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these evolving industry standards 
the emergence of new industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major systems manufacturers 
as a result  we could be required to invest significant time and effort and to incur significant expense to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards 
if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards or requirements  we could miss opportunities to achieve crucial design wins which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating and financial results 
the markets in which we compete are highly competitive  and we expect competition to increase in these markets in the future 
the markets in which we compete are highly competitive  and we expect that domestic and international competition will increase in these markets  due in part to deregulation  rapid technological advances  price erosion  changing customer preferences and evolving industry standards 
increased competition could result in significant price competition  reduced revenues  lower profit margins or loss of market share 
our ability to compete successfully in our markets depends on a number of factors  including our ability to partner with oem and channel partners who are successful in the market  success in designing and subcontracting the manufacture of new products that implement new technologies  product quality  interoperability  reliability  performance and certification  customer support  time to market  price  production efficiency  design wins  expansion of production of our products for particular systems manufacturers  end user acceptance of the systems manufacturers products  market acceptance of competitors products  and general economic conditions 
our competitors may offer enhancements to existing products  or offer new products based on new technologies  industry standards or customer requirements  that are available to customers on a more timely basis than comparable products from us or that have the potential to replace or provide lower cost alternatives to our products 
the introduction of enhancements or new products by our competitors could render our existing and future products obsolete or unmarketable 
we expect that certain of our competitors and other semiconductor companies may seek to develop and introduce products that integrate the functions performed by our ic products on a single chip  thus eliminating the need for our products 
each of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the communications ic markets  we compete primarily against companies such as lsi  broadcom  intel  mindspeed  pmc sierra and vitesse 
in the storage market  we primarily compete against companies such as adaptec  areca  hewlett packard  lsi  and promise 
our embedded processor products compete against products from freescale semiconductor  ibm and intel 
many of these companies have substantially greater financial  marketing and distribution resources than we have 
certain of our customers or potential customers have internal ic design or manufacturing capabilities with which we compete 
we may also face competition from new entrants to the storage market  including larger technology companies that may develop or acquire differentiating technology and then apply their resources to our detriment 
any failure by us to compete successfully in these target markets  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the storage market continues to mature and become commoditized 
to the extent that commoditization leads to significant pricing declines  whether initiated by us or by a competitor  we will be required to increase our product volumes and reduce our costs of goods sold to avoid resulting pressure on our profit margin for these products  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in responding to these competitive pricing pressures 
we do not have an internal wafer fabrication capability  which could result in unanticipated liability and reduced revenues 
during fiscal  we closed our internal wafer fabrication facility and no longer have the ability to manufacture products internally 
as a result  we are subject to substantial risks  including if we have not effectively stored certain products manufactured in our internal facility before its closure  we may incur liability to those customers to whom we have committed to deliver such products  and we may be unable to repair or replace such products 
our dependence on third party manufacturing and supply relationships increases the risk that we will not have an adequate supply of products to meet demand or that our cost of materials will be higher than expected 
we depend upon third parties to manufacture  assemble or package certain of our products 
as a result  we are subject to risks associated with these third parties  including reduced control over delivery schedules and quality  inadequate manufacturing yields and excessive costs  difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors  potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand  limited warranties on products supplied to us  potential increases in prices  potential instability in countries where third party manufacturers are located  and potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
our outside foundries generally manufacture our products on a purchase order basis  and we have very few long term supply arrangements with these suppliers 
we have less control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs than competitors with their own fabrication facilities 
a manufacturing disruption experienced by one or more of our outside foundries or a disruption of our relationship with an outside foundry  including discontinuance of our products by that foundry  would negatively impact the production of certain of our products for a substantial period of time 
our ic products are generally only qualified for production at a single foundry 
these suppliers can allocate  and in the past have allocated  capacity to the production of other companies products while reducing deliveries to us on short notice 
there is also the potential that they may discontinue manufacturing our products or go out of business 
because establishing relationships  designing or redesigning ics  and ramping production with new outside foundries may take over a year  there is no readily available alternative source of supply for these products 
difficulties associated with adapting our technology and product design to the proprietary process technology and design rules of outside foundries can lead to reduced yields of our ic products 
the process technology of an outside foundry is typically proprietary to the manufacturer 
since low yields may result from either design or process technology failures  yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used 
as a result  yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process  and resolution of yield problems may require cooperation between us and our manufacturer 
this risk could be compounded by the offshore location of certain of our manufacturers  increasing the effort and time required to identify  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems 
manufacturing defects that we do not discover during the manufacturing or testing process may lead to costly product recalls 
these risks may lead to increased costs or delayed product delivery  which would harm our profitability and customer relationships 
if the foundries or subcontractors we use to manufacture our products discontinue the manufacturing processes needed to meet our demands  or fail to upgrade their technologies needed to manufacture our products  we may be unable to deliver products to our customers  which could materially adversely affect our operating results 
the transition to the next generation of manufacturing technologies at one or more of our outside foundries could be unsuccessful or delayed 
our requirements typically represent a very small portion of the total production of the third party foundries 
as a result  we are subject to the risk that a producer will cease production of an older or lower volume process that it uses to produce our parts 
we cannot assure you that our external foundries will continue to devote resources to the production of our products or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of our products are based 
each of these events could increase our costs and materially impact our ability to deliver our products on time 
some companies that supply our customers are similarly dependent on a limited number of suppliers to produce their products 
these other companies products may be designed into the same networking equipment into which our products are designed 
our order levels could be reduced materially if these companies are unable to access sufficient production capacity to produce in volumes demanded by our customers because our customers may be forced to slow down or halt production on the equipment into which our products are designed 
our operating results depend on manufacturing output and yields of our ics and printed circuit board assemblies  which may not meet expectations 
the yields on wafers we have manufactured decline whenever a substantial percentage of wafers must be rejected or a significant number of die on each wafer are nonfunctional 
such declines can be caused by many factors  including minute levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  design issues  defects in masks used to print circuits on a wafer  and difficulties in the fabrication process 
design iterations and process changes by our suppliers can cause a risk of defects 
many of these problems are difficult to diagnose  are time consuming and expensive to remedy  and can result in shipment delays 
we estimate yields per wafer and final packaged parts in order to estimate the value of inventory 
if yields are materially different than projected  work in process inventory may need to be revalued 
we may have to take inventory write downs as a result of decreases in manufacturing yields 
we may suffer periodic yield problems in connection with new or existing products or in connection with the commencement of production at a new manufacturing facility 
we may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration and that may result in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
as smaller line width geometry processes become more prevalent  we expect to integrate greater levels of functionality into our ic products and to transition our ic products to increasingly smaller geometries 
this transition will require us to redesign certain products and will require us and our foundries to migrate to new manufacturing processes for our products 
we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis 
we periodically evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies to reduce our costs and increase performance  and we have designed ic products to be manufactured at as little as 
micron geometry processes 
we have experienced some difficulties in shifting to smaller geometry process technologies and new manufacturing processes 
these difficulties resulted in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
we may face similar difficulties  delays and expenses as we continue to transition our ic products to smaller geometry processes 
we are dependent on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully 
we cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our relationships with our foundries 
if we or our foundries experience significant delays in this transition or fail to implement this transition  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we must develop or otherwise gain access to improved ic process technologies 
our future success will depend upon our ability to improve existing ic process technologies or acquire new ic process technologies 
in the future  we may be required to transition one or more of our ic products to process technologies with smaller geometries  other materials or higher speeds in order to reduce costs or improve product performance 
we may not be able to improve our process technologies or otherwise gain access to new process technologies in a timely or affordable manner 
products based on these technologies may not achieve market acceptance 
the complexity of our products may lead to errors  defects and bugs  which could negatively impact our reputation with customers and result in liability 
products as complex as ours may contain errors  defects and bugs when first introduced or as new versions are released 
our products have in the past experienced such errors  defects and bugs 
delivery of products with production defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems could significantly delay or hinder market acceptance of the products or result in a costly recall and could damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and to attract new customers 
errors  defects or bugs could cause problems with device functionality  resulting in interruptions  delays or cessation of sales to our customers 
we may also be required to make significant expenditures of capital and resources to resolve such problems 
we cannot assure you that problems will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial production  despite testing by us  our suppliers or our customers 
any problem could result in additional development costs  loss of  or delays in  market acceptance  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  claims by our customers or others against us  and loss of credibility with our current and prospective customers 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if our internal controls over financial reporting are not considered effective  our business and stock price could be adversely affected 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year  and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in our annual report on form k for that fiscal year 
section also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  and report on  management s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting 
our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  does not expect that our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud involving a company have been  or will be  detected 
the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
over time  controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
our management has concluded  and our independent registered public accounting firm has attested  that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of march  in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option grant practices  we did identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that existed in fiscal years prior to fiscal we cannot assure you that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in our internal controls in the future 
a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting would require management and our independent registered public accounting firm to evaluate our internal controls as ineffective 
if our internal controls over financial reporting are not considered effective  we may experience another restatement and or a loss of public confidence  which could have an adverse effect on our business and on the market price of our common stock 
if we are unable to transition our accounting function smoothly  our ability to report our financial results accurately or on a timely basis may be adversely affected 
we are in the process of completing the transition of most of our accounting functions from san diego to sunnyvale 
we also have open employment positions in the accounting department that will remain in san diego 
if we are unable to complete the transition to the new team in an effective manner  it could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results accurately and or in a timely manner 
the inability to transition to the new accounting team in an effective manner could also have an adverse impact on our internal control environment 
this could cause us to have material weaknesses in our internal controls over our financial reporting and consequently could cause our management or our independent registered public accounting firm to determine our internal controls are ineffective 
if this were to occur  it could have an adverse impact on our business and could cause us to lose public confidence and may jeopardize the continued listing of our common stock  which could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 
our future success depends in part on the continued service of our key senior management  design engineering  sales  marketing  and manufacturing personnel and our ability to identify  hire and retain additional  qualified personnel 
our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our senior management personnel 
the loss of key senior executives could have a material adverse effect on our business 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry  in particular design  product and test engineers  and we may not be able to continue to attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business  or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel who may leave our employment in the future 
there may be significant costs associated with recruiting  hiring and retention of personnel 
periods of contraction in our business may inhibit our ability to attract and retain our personnel 
loss of the services of  or failure to recruit  key design engineers or other technical and management personnel could be significantly detrimental to our product development or other aspects of our business 
to manage operations effectively  we will be required to continue to improve our operational  financial and management systems and to successfully hire  train  motivate  and manage our employees 
the integration of future acquisitions would require significant additional management  technical and administrative resources 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to manage our expanded operations effectively 
our ability to supply a sufficient number of products to meet demand could be severely hampered by a shortage of water  electricity or other supplies  or by natural disasters or other catastrophes 
the manufacture of our products requires significant amounts of water 
previous droughts have resulted in restrictions being placed on water use by manufacturers 
in the event of a future drought  reductions in water use may be mandated generally and our external foundries ability to manufacture our products could be impaired 
several of our facilities  including our principal executive offices  are located in california 
in  california experienced prolonged energy alerts and blackouts caused by disruption in energy supplies 
as a consequence  california continues to experience substantially increased costs of electricity and natural gas 
we are unsure whether these alerts and blackouts will reoccur or how severe they may become in the future 
many of our customers and suppliers are also headquartered or have substantial operations in california 
if we or any of our major customers or suppliers located in california  experience a sustained disruption in energy supplies  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
a portion of our test and assembly facilities are located in our san diego  california location and a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are located in asia 
these areas are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes or floods 
we do not have earthquake or business interruption insurance for these facilities  because adequate coverage is not offered at economically justifiable rates 
a significant natural disaster or other catastrophic event could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and operating results 
the effects of war  acts of terrorism or global threats  including  but not limited to  the outbreak of epidemic disease  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat  or any future acts of terrorism  may cause further disruptions to local and global economies and create further uncertainties 
to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  or the manufacture or shipment of our products  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we have been named as a party to several derivative action lawsuits arising from our internal option review  and we may be named in additional litigation  all of which could require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses and may result in an unfavorable outcome which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are subject to a number of lawsuits purportedly on behalf of applied micro circuits corporation against certain of our current and former executive officers and board members  and we may become the subject of additional private or government actions 
the expense of defending such litigation may be significant 
the amount of time to resolve these lawsuits is unpredictable and defending ourselves may divert management s attention from the day to day operations of our business  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and cash flows 
as a result of our option review and restatement  we are subject to investigations by the sec and department of justice doj  which may not be resolved favorably and has required  and may continue to require  a significant amount of management time and attention and accounting and legal resources  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and cash flows 
the sec and the doj are currently conducting investigations relating to our historical stock option grant practices 
we have been responding to  and continue to respond to  inquiries from the sec and doj 
the period of time necessary to resolve the sec and doj investigations is uncertain  and these matters could require significant management and financial resources which could otherwise be devoted to the operation of our business 
if we are subject to an adverse finding resulting from the sec and doj investigations  we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us 
the restatement of our financial statements  the ongoing sec and doj investigations and any negative outcome that may occur from these investigations could impact our relationships with customers and our ability to generate revenue 
in addition  considerable legal and accounting expenses related to these matters have been incurred to date and significant expenditures may continue to be incurred in the future 
the sec and doj investigations  and any negative outcome that may result from such investigation  could adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the process of restating our financial statements  making the associated disclosures  and complying with sec requirements was subject to uncertainty and evolving requirements 
we worked with our independent registered public accounting firm and the sec to make our filings comply with all related requirements 
the issues surrounding the historical stock option grant practices are complex and the regulatory guidelines or requirements continue to evolve 
there can be no assurance that further sec and other requirements will not evolve and that we will not be required to further amend this filing 
in addition to the cost and time to amend financial reports  such an amendment may have a material adverse effect on our investors confidence and our common stock price 
if we do not maintain compliance with nasdaq listing requirements  our common stock could be delisted  which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock and cause some investors to lose interest in our company 
as a result of our option investigation  we were delinquent in filing certain of our periodic reports with the sec  and consequently we were not in compliance with nasdaq s marketplace rules 
as a result  we underwent a review and hearing process with nasdaq to determine our listing status 
once we filed the delinquent periodic reports with the sec  nasdaq permitted our securities to remain listed on the nasdaq global select market  but our securities could be delisted in the future if we do not maintain compliance with applicable listing requirements 
being delisted could affect our access to the capital markets and our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us or at all and could cause our investors  suppliers  customers and employees to lose confidence in us 
we could incur substantial fines or litigation costs associated with our storage  use and disposal of hazardous materials 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals that were used in our manufacturing process 
any failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines  the suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
these regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations or clean up prior discharges 
since  we have been named as a potentially responsible party prp along with a large number of other companies that used omega chemical corporation in whittier  california to handle and dispose of certain hazardous waste material 
we are a member of a large group of prps that has agreed to fund certain on going remediation efforts at the omega chemical site 
to date  our payment obligations with respect to these funding efforts have not been material  and we believe that our future obligations to fund these efforts will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
although we believe that we are currently in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  we cannot assure you that we are or will be in material compliance with these laws or regulations or that our future obligations to fund any remediation efforts  including those at the omega chemical site  will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
in  we closed our wafer fabrication facility in san diego  and the property was returned to the landlord 
environmental laws and regulations could cause a disruption in our business and operations 
we are subject to various state  federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment  including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making manufacturers of those products financially responsible for the collection  treatment  recycling and disposal of certain products 
such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate  including various european union eu member countries 
for example  the european union has enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs and the waste electrical and electronic equipment weee directives 
rohs prohibits the use of lead and other substances  in semiconductors and other products put on the market after july  the weee directive obligates parties that place electrical and electronic equipment on the market in the eu to put a clearly identifiable mark on the equipment  register with and report to eu member countries regarding distribution of the equipment  and provide a mechanism to take back and properly dispose of the equipment 
there can be no assurance that similar programs will not be implemented in other jurisdictions resulting in additional costs  possible delays in delivering products  and even the discontinuance of existing and planned future product replacements if cost were to become prohibitive 
our business strategy may contemplate the acquisition of other companies  products and technologies 
merger and acquisition activities involve numerous risks and we may not be able to address these risks successfully without substantial expense  delay or other operational or financial problems 
acquiring products  technologies or businesses from third parties is part of our business strategy 
the risks involved with merger and acquisition activities include potential dilution to our stockholders  use of a significant portion of our cash reserves  diversion of management s attention  failure to retain or integrate key personnel  difficulty in completing an acquired company s in process research or development projects  amortization of acquired intangible assets and deferred compensation  customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired company s products or services  costs associated with acquisitions or mergers  difficulties associated with the integration of acquired companies  products or technologies  difficulties competing in markets that are unfamiliar to us  ability of the acquired companies to meet their financial projections  and assumption of unknown liabilities  or other unanticipated events or circumstances 
any of these risks could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as with past acquisitions  future acquisitions could adversely affect operating results 
in particular  acquisitions may materially and adversely affect our results of operations because they may require large one time charges or could result in increased debt or contingent liabilities  adverse tax consequences  substantial additional depreciation or deferred compensation charges 
our past purchase acquisitions required us to capitalize significant amounts of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
as a result of the slowdown in our industry and reduction of our market capitalization  we have been required to record significant impairment charges against these assets as noted in our financial statements 
at march   we had million of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
we cannot assure you that we will not be required to take additional significant charges as a result of an impairment to the carrying value of these assets  due to further declines in market conditions 
any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and harm our results of operation and financial condition 
in august  we acquired quake technologies  inc quake  and we may make additional investments in or acquire other companies  products or technologies 
these acquisitions involve numerous risks  including problems combining or integrating the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the acquired organizations 
in addition  in the event of any such investments or acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt  assume liabilities  incur amortization or impairment expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  or incur large and immediate write offs 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we might acquire 
for example  with the acquisition of quake  we acquired the technology necessary to introduce gigabit ethernet physical layer chips and advance our efforts in the enterprise part of the market 
gigabit ethernet is an emerging technology  and we cannot assure you that this technology will be successful 
in addition  several of our competitors have introduced similar products in the last quarter 
if our customers do not purchase our new power amplifier modules  our development and integration efforts will have been unsuccessful  and our business may suffer 
our subsidiary has been named as a defendant in litigation that could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
jni corporation  which we acquired in october  has a number of pending lawsuits relating to alleged securities law violations and alleged breaches of fiduciary duty 
we believe that the claims pending against jni are without merit  and we have engaged in a vigorous defense against such claims 
if we are not successful in our defense against such claims  we could be forced to make significant payments to the plaintiffs and their lawyers  and such payments could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations if not covered by our insurance carriers 
even if such claims are not successful  the litigation could result in substantial costs including  but not limited to  attorney and expert fees  and divert management s attention and resources  which could have an adverse effect on our business 
although insurers have paid defense costs to date  we cannot assure you that insurers will continue to pay such costs  judgments or other expenses associated with the lawsuit 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property adequately 
we rely in part on patents to protect our intellectual property 
we cannot assure you that our pending patent applications or any future applications will be approved  or that any issued patents will adequately protect the intellectual property in our products  will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties  or that if challenged  any such patent will be found to be valid or enforceable 
others may independently develop similar products or processes  duplicate our products or processes or design around any patents that may be issued to us 
to protect our intellectual property  we also rely on the combination of mask work protection under the federal semiconductor chip protection act of  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements  and licensing arrangements 
despite these efforts  we cannot assure you that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property  or disclose such intellectual property or trade secrets  or that we can meaningfully protect our intellectual property 
a failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and strategic partners 
we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these efforts  parties may attempt to copy  disclose  obtain or use our products  services or technology without our authorization 
also  former employees may seek employment with our business partners  customers or competitors and we you that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 
additionally  former employees or third parties could attempt to penetrate our network to misappropriate our proprietary information or interrupt our business 
because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 
as a result  our technologies and processes may be misappropriated  particularly in foreign countries where laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we could be harmed by litigation involving patents  proprietary rights or other claims 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources  including the attention of our management and technical personnel  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be accused of infringing on the intellectual property rights of third parties 
we have certain indemnification obligations to customers with respect to the infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products 
we cannot assure you that infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers or end users resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted in the future  or that such assertions will not harm our business 
any litigation relating to the intellectual property rights of third parties would at a minimum be costly and could divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel 
in the event of any adverse ruling in any such litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacturing  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain a license under the intellectual property rights of the third party claiming infringement 
a license might not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
from time to time  we may be involved in litigation relating to other claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business 
we cannot assure you that the ultimate outcome of any such matters will not have a material  adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly 
in the future  the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to general economic and market conditions and in response to quarter to quarter variations in our anticipated or actual operating results  announcements or introductions of new products by us or our competitors  anticipated or actual operating results of our customers  peers or competitors  technological innovations or setbacks by us or our competitors  conditions in the semiconductor  communications or information technology markets  the commencement or outcome of litigation or governmental investigations  changes in ratings and estimates of our performance by securities analysts  announcements of merger or acquisition transactions  management changes  our inclusion in certain stock indices  and other events or factors 
the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many high technology companies  particularly semiconductor companies 
in some instances  these fluctuations appear to have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies 
any such fluctuation could harm the market price of our common stock 
the anti takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and of the delaware general corporation law may delay  defer or prevent a change of control 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be harmed by  the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may delay  defer or prevent a change in control  as the terms of the preferred stock that might be issued could potentially prohibit our consummation of any merger  reorganization  sale of substantially all of our assets  liquidation or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of the holders of the outstanding shares of preferred stock 
the issuance of preferred stock could have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 
if we issue additional shares of stock in the future  it may have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 
we have a significant number of authorized and unissued shares of our common stock available 
these shares will provide us with the flexibility to issue our common stock for proper corporate purposes  which may include making acquisitions through the use of stock  adopting additional equity incentive plans and raising equity capital 
any issuance of our common stock may result in immediate dilution of our stockholders

we generate revenues primarily through sales of our ic products  embedded processors and pcbas to oems  such as alcatel lucent  ciena  cisco  brocade  fujitsu  hitachi  huawei  juniper  ericsson  nec  nortel  nokia siemens networks  and tellabs  who in turn supply their equipment principally to communications service providers 
in the storage market we generate revenues primarily through sales of our sata raid controllers to our distribution channel partners who in turn sell to enterprises  small and mid size businesses  vars  systems integrators and retail consumers 
the demand for our products has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability  as well as the ability of our customers  to manage inventory corrections  the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products 
our ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce  and market new products and technologies in a cost effective and timely manner  the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt our products and technologies in our target markets  general economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and communications markets  and combinations of companies in our customer base  may result in the resulting combined company choosing our competitor s ic standardization other than our supported product platforms 
for these and other reasons  our net revenue and results of operations in and prior periods may not necessarily be indicative of future net revenue and results of operations 
based on direct shipments  net revenues to customers that exceeded of total net revenues in any of the three years ended march  were as follows avnet sanmina sci less than of total net revenues for period indicated 
on july   avnet acquired insight electronics 
for purposes of the table above  the shipments to insight electronics and avnet were retroactively combined for all periods presented 
looking through product shipments to distributors and subcontractors to the end customers  to the best of our knowledge  net revenues to end customers that exceeded of total net revenues in any of the three years ended march  were as follows nortel networks corporation less than of total net revenues for period indicated 
we expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in fiscal and for the foreseeable future 
net revenues by geographic region were as follows in thousands fiscal years ended march  united states of america other north america europe and israel asia other all of our revenue has been denominated in us dollars 
in addition  in an effort to diversify our customer base and markets that we serve  we have also made several acquisitions 
in april  we completed the acquisition of ware  inc  a provider of high performance  high capacity sata storage solutions  for a purchase price of approximately million in cash 
in may and december  we acquired intellectual property and a portfolio of assets associated with ibm s series of embedded powerpc standard products for approximately million in cash 
the powerpc series product line targets internet  communication  data storage  consumer and imaging applications 
in august  we acquired quake technologies  inc  a leader in gigabit ethernet ge physical layer technology for approximately million in cash 
net loss 
our net loss has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following stock based compensation expense  amortization of purchased intangibles  acquired in process research and development ipr d  litigation settlement costs  restructuring charges  goodwill impairment charges  combinations of companies within our customer base  purchased intangible asset impairment charges  and income tax expenses benefits 
since the start of fiscal  we have invested a total of approximately million in the research and development of new products  including higher speed  lower power and lower cost products  products that combine the functions of multiple existing products into single highly integrated products  and other products to complete our portfolio of communications and storage products 
these products  and our customers products for which they are intended  are highly complex 
due to this complexity  it often takes several years to complete the development and qualification of these products before they enter into volume production 
accordingly  we have not yet generated significant revenues from some of the products developed during this time period 
in addition  downturns in the telecommunications market can severely impact our customers business and usually results in significantly less demand for our products than was expected when the development work commenced and  as a result of restructuring activities  we discontinued development of several products that were in process and slowed down development of others as we realized that demand for these products would not materialize as originally anticipated 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to inventory valuation and warranty liabilities  which affects our cost of sales and gross margin  the valuation of purchased intangibles and goodwill  which affects our amortization and impairments of goodwill and other intangibles  the valuation of restructuring liabilities  which affects the amount and timing of restructuring charges  and the valuation of deferred income taxes  which affects our income tax expense and benefit 
we also have other key accounting policies  such as our policies for stock based compensation  revenue recognition  including the deferral of a portion of revenues on sales to distributors  and allowance for bad debts 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying these most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from management s estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation and warranty liabilities our policy is to value inventories at the lower of cost or market on a part by part basis 
this policy requires us to make estimates regarding the market value of our inventories  including an assessment of excess or obsolete inventories 
we determine excess and obsolete inventories based on an estimate of the future demand for our products within a specified time horizon  generally months 
the estimates we use for future demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our revenue forecasts 
if our demand forecast is greater than our actual demand we may be required to take additional excess inventory charges  which would decrease gross margin and net operating results 
for example  reducing our future demand estimate to six months could increase our current reserve balance by approximately million as of march  alternatively  increasing our future demand forecast to months could reduce our exposure by approximately million below the current reserve  as of march  our products typically carry a one to three year warranty 
we establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  use of materials and service delivery costs incurred in correcting any product failure and changes to master purchase agreements with our larger customers 
should actual product failure rates  use of materials or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  additional warranty reserves could be required  which could reduce our gross margin 
additional change to negotiated master purchase agreements could result in increased warranties reserves and unfavorably impact present and future gross margins 
goodwill and intangible asset valuation the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  including ipr d 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact future amortization  and the amount assigned to ipr d is expensed immediately 
determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible assets requires the use of estimates and the exercise of judgment 
while there are a number of different generally accepted valuation methods to estimate the value of intangible assets acquired  we primarily use the discounted cash flow method and the market comparison approach 
these methods require significant management judgment to forecast the future operating results used in the analysis 
in addition  other significant estimates are required such as residual growth rates and discount factors 
the estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages 
these judgments can significantly affect our net operating results 
we are required to assess goodwill impairment annually using the methodology prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
in fiscal and  in accordance with sfas  we determined that there were three reporting units to be tested 
the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying value of the reporting unit 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business combination 
determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions  including projection and timing of future cash flows  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  determination of appropriate market comparables  and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
it is possible that the plans and estimates used to value these assets may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 
for fiscal  the discounted cash flows for each reporting unit were based in discrete ten year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes 
cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts were estimated using terminal value calculations 
the sales compound annual growth rates ranged from to for the reporting units during the discrete forecast period and the future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of and terminal growth rates of 
we did not recognize any goodwill impairment as a result of performing this annual test 
a variance in the discount rate or the estimated revenue growth rate could have had a significant impact on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and consequently the amount of identified goodwill impairment 
for example  a increase in the discount rate would have resulted in an indication of possible impairment that would have led us to further quantify the impairment and potentially record a charge to write down these assets in fiscal for fiscal  the discounted cash flows for each reporting unit were based on discrete ten year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes 
cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts were estimated using terminal value calculations 
the sales compound annual growth rates ranged from to for the reporting units during the discrete forecast period and the future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of and terminal growth rates of 
upon completion of the annual impairment test for fiscal  we determined that there was an indication of impairment because the estimated carrying values of two of the three reporting units exceeded their respective fair values 
as a result  we performed additional analysis as required by sfas the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
any variance in the assumptions used to value the unrecognized intangible assets could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of the unrecognized intangible assets and consequently the amount of identified goodwill impairment 
as a result of the additional analysis performed  we recorded a charge for million in the fourth quarter of fiscal which primarily relates to the deterioration of revenues associated with the products we acquired in the jni acquisition 
for fiscal  the discounted cash flows for each reporting unit were based on discrete five year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes 
cash flows beyond the five year discrete forecasts were estimated using terminal value calculations 
the sales compound annual growth rates ranged from to for the reporting units during the discrete forecast period and the future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of and terminal growth rates of 
we did not recognize any goodwill impairment as a result of performing this annual test 
a variance in the discount rate or the estimated revenue growth rate would have had a significant impact on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and consequently the amount of identified goodwill impairment 
for example  a increase in the discount rate would have resulted in an indication of possible impairment that would have led us to further quantify the impairment and potentially record a charge to write down these assets in fiscal restructuring charges over the last several years we have undertaken significant restructuring initiatives  which have required us to develop formalized plans for exiting certain business activities and reducing spending levels 
we have had to record estimated expenses for employee severance  long term asset write downs  lease cancellations  facilities consolidation costs  and other restructuring costs 
given the significance  and the timing of the execution  of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made 
in calculating the charges for our excess facilities  we have to estimate the timing of exiting certain facilities 
our assumptions for exiting and or reoccupying certain facilities may be incorrect  which could result in the need to record additional costs or reduce estimated amounts previously charged to restructuring expense 
for example  in fiscal  when we decided to reoccupy a previously restructured facility  we eliminated the liability which reduced our restructuring expense 
our policies require us to periodically evaluate  at least semiannually  the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
in fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of million associated with our restructuring actions 
for a full description of our restructuring activities  refer to our discussion of restructuring charges in the results of operations section 
valuation of deferred income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  including reversals of deferred tax liabilities  in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we were to determine that we will not realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  we would make an adjustment to the carrying value of the deferred tax asset  which would be reflected as income tax expense 
conversely  if we were to determine that we will realize a deferred tax asset  which currently has a valuation allowance  we would reverse the valuation allowance which would be reflected as an income tax benefit or as an adjustment to stockholders equity  for tax assets related to stock options  or goodwill  for tax assets related to acquired businesses 
stock based compensation expense for fiscal and thereafter effective april  we adopted revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas r  share based payment  sfas r requires all share based payments  including grants of stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights  to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values 
under this standard  the fair value of each employee stock option and employee stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share based payments 
the black scholes model meets the requirements of sfas r but the fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our stock based awards as it does not consider certain factors important to stock based awards  such as continued employment  periodic vesting requirements and limited transferability 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected volatility of our stock options at grant date by equally weighting the historical volatility and the implied volatility of our stock over specific periods of time as the expected volatility assumption required in the black scholes model 
the expected life of the stock options is based on historical and other data including life of the option and vesting period 
the risk free interest rate assumption is the implied yield currently available on zero coupon government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
the fair value of our restricted stock units are based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
stock based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements in fiscal and thereafter is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
the amount of stock based compensation expense in fiscal and thereafter will be reduced for estimated forfeitures based on historical experience 
forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we will evaluate the assumptions used to value stock based awards on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
we currently estimate when and if performance based options will be earned 
if the awards are not considered probable of achievement  no amount of stock based compensation is recognized 
if we considered the award to be probable  expense is recorded over the estimated service period 
to the extent our assumptions are incorrect  the amount of stock based compensation recorded will be increased or decreased 
to the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or we assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions  our stock based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions 
had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the magnitude of the impact of that standard on our results of operations would have approximated the pro forma number impact of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  share based payment  described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements under stock based compensation 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab revenue recognition in financial statements  as well as sab  revenue recognition 
these pronouncements require that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized there is evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue upon determination that all criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
in addition  we do not recognize revenue until all customers acceptance criteria have been met 
the criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment  except for shipments to distributors with rights of return 
the portion of revenue from shipments to distributors subject to rights of return is deferred until the agreed upon percentage of return or cancellation privileges lapse 
revenue from shipments to distributors without return rights is recognized upon shipment 
in addition  we record reductions to revenue for estimated allowances such as returns  competitive pricing programs and rebates 
these estimates are based on our experience with product returns and the contractual terms of the competitive pricing and rebate programs 
shipping terms are generally fca shipping point 
if actual returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates  we would record additional reductions to revenue 
allowance for bad debt we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  the aging of accounts receivable  our history of bad debts  and the general condition of the industry 
if a major customer s credit worthiness deteriorates  or our customers actual defaults exceed our historical experience  our estimates could change and impact our reported results 
results of operations comparison of the year ended march  to the year ended march  net revenues 
net revenues for the year ended march  were approximately million  representing an increase of from the net revenues of approximately million for the year ended march  we classified our revenues into three categories based on markets that the underlying products serve 
the categories are integrated communication products icp  which consists of communications and embedded products  storage and other 
we use this information to analyze our performance and success in these markets 
see the following tables dollars in thousands fiscal years ended march  amount of net revenue amount of net revenue increase decrease change communications embedded products icp subtotal storage other the net revenue increase for the fiscal year ended march  was largely due to an increase in sales of our icp products and in particular  an increase in sales of our embedded products 
the increase was offset by a marginal decline in storage revenues due to supply issues in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the effect of the discontinuance of our fibre channel host bus adapter hba business 
the decline in storage revenues was offset by new product introductions and our efforts to enhance our sales channels in europe 
the decrease in other revenues was due to our focus on new product development 
we will continue to see our other revenues decline as we focus our efforts on new product development 
as a result of our efforts to reduce ongoing operating expenses  we have refocused our product development efforts on higher growth opportunities focus products and away from certain legacy products nonfocus products 
product areas we have focused on are products that process  transport and store information 
our process technology products focus on utilizing our sixth generation of network processor cores and our power architecture portfolio to meet the needs of the converged internet protocol ip ethernet network while the transport technology products focus on metro ethernet  triple play access technologies and error correction solutions 
the storage technology products address the needs of mass storage based on high performance sequential input output i o 
the nonfocus product areas are our legacy switching products  application specific integrated circuits asics  fibre channel hbas  storage area network san ics  pointer processors  and legacy framers 
we expect the revenues from our nonfocus products to continue to decline in the future 
the following table illustrates revenue from our focus and nonfocus areas dollars in thousands fiscal years ended march  amount of net revenue amount of net revenue increase decrease change focus nonfocus gross profit 
the following table presents net revenues  cost of revenues and gross profit for the fiscal years ended march  and dollars in thousands fiscal years ended march  amount of net revenue amount of net revenue increase change net revenues cost of revenues gross profit the increase in gross profit for the fiscal year ended march  was primarily attributable to the overall increase in net revenues 
the gross profit percentage for the fiscal year ended march  declined to compared to for the fiscal year ended march  this decline was primarily due to price erosion and product mix changes offset by cost improvements  million reduction in warranty reserves and million in additional gross profit relating to an arrangement with a customer to buy down a part of its future commitment to purchase products from us 
the amortization of purchased intangible assets included in cost of revenues during the year ended march  was million compared to million for the year ended march  based on the amount of capitalized purchased intangibles on the balance sheet as of march   we expect amortization expense for purchased intangibles charged to cost of revenues to be million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million for fiscal periods thereafter 
future acquisitions of businesses may result in substantial additional charges  which would impact the gross margin in future periods 
research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses 
the following table presents research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended march  and dollars in thousands fiscal years ended march  amount of net revenue amount of net revenue increase change research and development selling  general and administrative research and development 
research and development r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs including stock based compensation of employees engaged in research  design and development activities  costs related to engineering design tools  subcontracting costs and facilities expenses 
the increase in r d expenses of for the fiscal year ended march   compared to the fiscal year ended march   was primarily due to an increase of million in technology access fees  million in personnel expenses related to the acquisition of quake  million in outside contractors  million in stock based compensation expenses and million in other expenses  offset by a decrease of million in foundry expenses  million in testing costs  million in packaging costs  million in software expenses and million increase in credits from order settlements 
we believe that a continued commitment to r d is vital to our goal of maintaining a leadership position with innovative icp and storage products 
currently  r d expenses are focused on the development of icp and storage products and we expect to continue this focus 
we expect r d expenses to increase in dollars as we continue to invest in our product road map but decrease as a percent of revenues as sales of our newly introduced products begin to ramp 
future acquisitions of businesses may result in substantial additional on going costs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses  professional and legal fees  corporate branding and facilities expenses 
the increase in sg a expenses of for fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march   was primarily due to an increase of million in outside contractors  million in personnel related expenses  million in stock based compensation  million in external sales commissions  in marketing communications  and in travel expenses  offset by a decrease of million in facilities cost  million in indirect material and services  million in corporate allocations and million in corporate donations 
we expect sg a expenses to remain consistent next year  as a percentage of revenues 
future acquisitions of businesses may result in substantial additional on going costs 
stock based compensation 
the following table presents stock based compensation expense for the fiscal years ended march  and  which was included in the tables above dollars in thousands fiscal years ended march  amount of net revenue amount of net revenue increase change costs of revenues research and development selling  general and administrative the amounts included in the fiscal year ended march  reflect the adoption of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated statements of operations for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in stock based compensation expense for the year ended march  compared to the year ended march  is primarily due to the impact of the adoption of sfas r 
the stock based compensation expense recorded for the year ended march  relates primarily to the amortization of deferred compensation related to acquisitions 
deferred compensation is the difference between the fair value of our common stock at the date of each acquisition and the exercise price of the unvested stock options assumed in the acquisition 
the adoption of sfas r will continue to have a significant adverse impact on our reported results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall liquidity 
the amount of unearned stock based compensation currently estimated to be expensed from now through fiscal related to unvested share based payment awards at march  is million 
this expense relates to equity instruments already issued and will not be affected by our future stock price 
the weighted average period over which the unearned stock based compensation is expected to be recognized is approximately years 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
future stock based compensation expense will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards 
we anticipate we will continue to grant additional employee stock options and restricted stock units in fiscal and thereafter 
the value of these grants cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the number of share based payments granted and the then current fair values 
acquired in process research and development 
for the fiscal year ended march   we recorded million of acquired ipr d resulting from the acquisition of quake technologies  inc this amount was expensed on the acquisition date because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses 
the ipr d charge related to the quake acquisition was made up of two projects that were and complete at the date of acquisition 
the estimated cost to complete these projects was million and million  respectively  and the discount rate applied to calculate the ipr d charge was and  respectively 
we did not acquire any companies in fiscal and as a result we did not have any ipr d expense 
goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charges 
to coincide with our annual long range planning process  we assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  or more frequently if the indicators of impairment are present 
our impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal did not result in any impairment charges 
based upon an analysis performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which included a discounted cash flow analysis  as well as market comparables  we recorded a charge for the impairment of goodwill of million  which was recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
restructuring charges 
the following table presents restructuring charges for the fiscal years ended march  and march  dollars in thousands fiscal years ended march  amount of net revenue amount of net revenue decrease change restructuring charges in april  we announced a restructuring program 
the april restructuring program consisted of a workforce reduction of employees  consolidation of excess facilities and fixed asset disposals 
we recognized a total of million in restructuring costs related to the plan 
the restructuring costs consisted of approximately million for employee severances  million representing the discounted cash flow of lease payments on exited facilities  million for the disposal of certain software licenses  and million for the write off of leasehold improvements and property and equipment 
this restructuring charge was offset by a million restructuring benefit  in november  related to the reoccupation of a portion of a building in san diego and an adjustment for overestimated severance to be paid 
during fiscal  this restructuring accrual was reduced by million to zero due to the planned reoccupation of this building prior to september in july  we implemented another restructuring program 
the july restructuring program was implemented to reduce job redundancies and reduce ongoing operating expenses 
the restructuring program consisted of the elimination of approximately employees  the disposal of idle fixed assets  and the consolidation of san diego facilities 
as a result of the july restructuring  we recorded a charge of approximately million  consisting of million for employee severances  million for property and equipment write offs and million representing expenses relating to the consolidation of facilities

comparison of the year ended march  to the year ended march  net revenues 
net revenues for the year ended march  were approximately million  representing an increase of from the net revenues of approximately million for the year ended march  during most of fiscal  we classified our revenues into three categories based on markets that the underlying products serve 
the categories were communication  storage and embedded 
we used this information to analyze the performance and success in these markets 
the increase in total net revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in our communications and embedded product revenues  offset by decreases in our storage and other revenues 
in december  we combined the categories of communications and embedded to form the icp category 
see the following tables dollars in thousands fiscal years ended march  amount of net revenue amount of net revenue increase decrease change communications embedded products icp subtotal storage other the communication revenue increased largely due to an increase in the volume of our communication products and the embedded products increased primarily due to the introduction of new products and to an increase in average price of the products sold 
storage revenue decreased due to the phase out of the fibre channel hba products offset by an increase in volume of our raid products 
in fiscal  we discontinued our fibre channel hba products 
these products accounted for a significant portion of our storage revenues in fiscal and though we continue to ship these products  the revenue from sales of these products has declined significantly and is expected to continue to decline

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and a decline in the stock market 
we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
these securities are classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
we have established guidelines relative to diversification and maturities that attempt to maintain safety and liquidity 
these guidelines are periodically reviewed and modified to take advantage of interest rate trends 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us treasury  corporate bonds  mortgage backed and asset backed securities and closed end bond funds  with credit ratings as specified in our investment policy 
we also have invested in preferred stocks  which pay quarterly fixed rate dividends 
we generally do not utilize derivatives to hedge against increases in interest rates which decrease market values  except for investments managed by one investment manager who utilizes us treasury bond futures options futures options as a protection against the impact of increases in interest rates on the fair value of preferred stocks managed by that investment manager 
we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments 
at march   our investment portfolio included fixed income securities classified as available for sale investments with a fair market value of million and a cost basis of million 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk  as well as credit risk  and will decline in value if interest rates increase or an issuer s credit rating or financial condition is decreased 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value of our short term investments held at march  in thousands valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points bps fair value as of march  valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points bps bps bps bps bps bps bps available for sale investments the modeling technique used measures the change in fair market value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points  basis points  and basis points 
we invest in equity instruments of private companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are valued based on our historical cost  less any recognized impairments 
the estimated fair values are not necessarily representative of the amounts that we could realize in a current transaction 
we generally conduct business  including sales to foreign customers  in us dollars  and as a result  we have limited foreign currency exchange rate risk 
however  we have entered into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge our overseas monthly operating expenses when deemed appropriate 
gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts that are designated and effective as hedges of anticipated transactions  for which a firm commitment has been attained  are deferred and included in the basis of the transaction in the same period that the underlying transaction is settled 
gains and losses on any instruments not meeting the above criteria are recognized in income or expenses in the consolidated statement of operations in the current period 
the effect of an immediate percent change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations
