overview paetec holding corp 
on february   paetec corp 
completed its combination by merger with us lec corp  creating one of the largest competitive carriers in the united states 
before the combination  paetec holding corp 
was a wholly owned subsidiary of paetec corp 
formed by paetec corp 
to complete the merger 
paetec holding had no operations or material assets before the merger 
as a result of the merger  paetec corp 
and us lec corp 
became wholly owned subsidiaries of paetec holding 
pursuant to the merger  each outstanding share of class a common stock of paetec corp 
was converted into the right to receive shares of the common stock of paetec holding and each outstanding share of us lec class a common stock was converted into the right to receive share of the common stock of paetec holding 
at the effective time of the merger  each then outstanding option  warrant or other right to acquire common stock of paetec corp 
or us lec  whether or not vested or exercisable at that time  was assumed by paetec holding and converted into an option  warrant or other right  as applicable  to purchase paetec holding common stock on the same terms and conditions applicable to such option  warrant or right in effect before the merger  including existing vesting and exercisability provisions without any acceleration  except that the number of shares subject to  and to the extent applicable the per share exercise price of  the option  warrant or other right was adjusted based on the applicable exchange ratio 
as part of the transaction  paetec holding obtained million of new senior secured credit facilities from a syndicate of lenders 
of the proceeds  million were used  together with a portion of cash on hand  to refinance substantially all of the senior secured indebtedness of paetec corp 
and us lec and to repurchase all outstanding shares of us lec s preferred stock 
paetec holding is integrating the operations of paetec corp 
and us lec to achieve anticipated significant cost efficiencies from the consolidation of sales and marketing  customer service  provisioning and installation  and information technology  purchasing  financial  administrative and other functions 
we believe the merger will provide substantial strategic and financial benefits  including strategic benefits arising from a greater geographic scope of operations  broader product offerings and enhanced customer service capabilities  significant anticipated cost savings  improved operational efficiencies and synergies  and increased financial strength and flexibility 
paetec holding has accounted for the merger as a purchase of us lec  using the purchase method of accounting 
as a result of the merger  paetec holding s business  financial condition and results of operations for periods after february  will include the business  financial condition and results of operations of paetec corp  us lec corp 
and their respective subsidiaries

as a result  the information in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations represents historical information concerning paetec corp 
without giving effect to the merger 
unless the context otherwise requires  references below to paetec mean paetec corp 
and its subsidiaries  as predecessor to paetec holding without giving effect to the merger 
historical overview of paetec paetec is a provider of integrated communications services  including local and long distance voice services  data and internet services  and software applications  network integration and managed services 
paetec currently provides these services to approximately  medium sized and large businesses  institutions and other communications intensive users within its market service area 
paetec currently has approximately  employees  including approximately direct sales professionals 
as of december   paetec had in service  digital t transmission lines  which 
table of contents represented the equivalent of  telephone lines  for approximately  core network services and carrier services customers in its market service area 
paetec is headquartered outside of rochester  new york and had approximately  employees as of december  since its formation in  paetec has broadened its range of service offerings  developed and installed its network and back office systems  and expanded its customer base 
paetec s net losses during its initial years of operations were largely attributable to the costs associated with developing paetec s back office and sales capabilities 
paetec first achieved annual operating income in and first achieved annual net income in paetec generated net income of million for as of december   paetec had outstanding debt obligations of million and cash and cash equivalents of million 
since the fourth quarter of  paetec has generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund its capital expenditures and service its debt 
since its formation  paetec has experienced substantial growth  increasing its total revenue from million for to million for paetec believes that its focus on providing services to medium sized and large end user customers has been instrumental to its continued revenue growth 
revenue generated by end user customers represents all of paetec s network services revenue and integrated solutions offerings revenue and represented approximately of paetec s total revenue for paetec s carrier services business generated the remainder of its revenue for this period 
to supplement paetec s internal growth  the company has pursued an acquisition strategy that it believes would allow it to increase penetration of its current markets  expand into new markets and enhance its ability to sell and deliver value added services 
in accordance with this strategy  paetec has focused its acquisition efforts on local and long distance providers  on enhanced service providers and on interconnect companies that sell  install and maintain data and voice networks for customers 
from november through  paetec acquired all of the outstanding stock of east florida communications  campuslink communications systems  inc  pinnacle software corporation and american long lines  inc and the customer bases or other assets of standard communications  inc  telperion development corporation  data voice networks  inc and covista communications  inc 
the operating results attributable to these acquisitions are included in paetec s consolidated statements of operations from the dates of those acquisitions 
paetec s senior management team manages the company s business as a consolidated entity 
all of paetec s products and services  sales channels and targeted customer bases are similar or related  and all of paetec s products and services are supported by similar network operations  back office systems and technology requirements 
paetec accordingly operates and manages its business as one segment 
trends affecting our business 
the telecommunications industry has remained highly competitive in an environment marked by overcapacity in some sectors and increased deregulation 
market forces and changes in government regulations have required  and may continue to require  us to reduce rates for some of the services we provide 
these trends will likely reduce our historical rate of revenue growth and continue to exert pressure on our operating margins 
we believe  however  that these reduced rates have been and in will continue to be offset by increased sales volume 
in addition  we believe that the relatively long term nature of our agreements with customers of our network services  which have an average initial term of three years  should reduce the likelihood that we will experience significant  rapid decreases in the rates we charge for our services 
wireless substitution 
as telecommunications customers increasingly use wireless forms of communication  such as hand held internet access devices and cell phones  the volume of traffic carried by traditional wireline telecommunications networks has declined and is expected to continue to decline 
although we believe this trend is most pronounced in the residential marketplace  wireless substitution also has had an adverse effect on the wireline usage patterns of the medium sized and large businesses and institutions we target 
we believe wireless substitution has led to a decrease in the average minutes of use generated by our customers 
to date  we have been able to offset this loss of revenue from existing customers through sales of services to new customers 
we believe that the transition to wireless based forms of communication will continue in the foreseeable future 
we attempt to respond to this trend by offering service levels and product packages that are not currently available using wireless alternatives 
converged voice and data traffic 
voice and data traffic historically have traveled over telecommunications networks using incompatible transmission formats 
this means that a telecommunications transmission circuit had to be designated to carry either data traffic or voice traffic 
as a result  excess capacity on a voice circuit could not be made available to reduce demand on a data circuit 
new technologies that allow voice and data traffic to travel interchangeably over the same network  commonly known as voice over internet protocols or voip  technology  enables more efficient use of the 
table of contents telecommunications networks 
because we lease the majority of our transmission capacity  this increased efficiency has the potential to reduce significantly our cost of providing services to our customers 
in the coming years  we plan to install equipment and transition our network to take full advantage of these new technologies 
in addition  service disruptions may accompany the transition to a new technology  which could adversely affect our revenues 
financial difficulties faced by many competitive communications carriers 
over the last five years  many competitive communications services providers have experienced financial difficulties 
these difficulties have led to the general perception that our industry is marred by instability and financial weakness 
this perception makes it harder for us to gain new customers  raise additional capital and negotiate with our vendors 
we have addressed this perception by maintaining cash balances that are generally in excess of our current needs and by limiting our growth activities so that we do not impair our short term cash flow 
industry consolidation 
our industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation in recent periods 
these transactions have created more significant competitors for paetec and have reduced the number of vendors from whom paetec may purchase network elements it requires to operate its business 
we expect for this trend to continue in the near future 
to compete more effectively in our industry  we plan to pursue our own acquisition strategy to increase our operating leverage  achieve economies of scale and broaden our name recognition 
revenue paetec derives revenue from sales of its network services  carrier services and integrated solutions services 
paetec derives most of its revenue from monthly recurring fees and usage based fees that are generated principally by sales of its network services 
monthly recurring fees include the fees paid by paetec s customers for lines in service and additional features on those lines 
monthly recurring fees are paid by paetec s end user customers and are billed in advance 
usage based fees consist of fees paid by paetec s network services customers for each call made  fees paid by the incumbent carriers in paetec s markets as reciprocal compensation when paetec terminates local calls made by their customers  and access fees paid by carriers for long distance calls paetec originates or terminates 
access revenue  which represents revenue generated by access fees and reciprocal compensation  represented of paetec s total revenue for  of paetec s total revenue for the year ended december   and of paetec s total revenue for the year ended december  reciprocal compensation constituted of paetec s total revenue for and  and of paetec s total revenue for most of paetec s access fees and reciprocal compensation for these periods were generated by paetec s carrier services 
access revenue  as a percentage of carrier services revenue  decreased to in from in  and in access revenue  as a percentage of network services revenue  was and  and in the decrease in access fees and reciprocal compensation was principally due to a shift in product mix 
with respect to any customer  the monthly recurring fees and usage based fees generated by sales of paetec s network services and carrier services tend to be relatively consistent from month to month  subject to changes in the calling patterns of the customer s business 
these fees generally are based on the number of digital t transmission lines used by the customer 
because paetec believes that the cumulative number of digital t transmission lines in service provides accurate information with respect to its future revenue  the company uses data with respect to the cumulative number of digital t transmission lines paetec has in service from period to period to assist it in evaluating revenue trends related to its network services and carrier services businesses 
network services 
paetec delivers integrated communications services  including local services  long distance services and data and internet services  to end users on a retail basis  which the company refers to as its network services 
revenue from network services represented approximately of paetec s total revenue for and  and of paetec s total revenue for paetec s network services revenue consists primarily of monthly recurring fees and usage based recurring fees 
paetec recognizes revenue during the period in which the revenue is earned 
paetec s network services also generate non recurring service activation and installation fee revenues  which it receives upon initiation of service 
paetec defers recognition of these revenues and amortizes them over the average customer life  primarily three years 
carrier services 
paetec generates revenue from wholesale sales of communications services to other communications businesses  which the company refers to as its carrier services 
revenue from carrier services represented approximately of paetec s total revenue for and  and of paetec s total revenue for 
table of contents paetec s carrier services revenue consists primarily of monthly recurring fees and usage based fees 
usage based fees for paetec s carrier services consist primarily of the interstate and intrastate access fees the company receives from other communications providers when it originates or terminates long distance calls made by their customers and the reciprocal compensation fees paetec receives from incumbent carriers when it terminates local calls made by their customers 
access fee and reciprocal compensation revenue generated by network services and carrier services 
paetec generates access fees when paetec s switching facilities provide a connection between a long distance carrier and the paetec end user 
the fcc historically has regulated the access rates imposed by incumbent carriers  while providing less regulation of the access rates of competitive carriers 
in april and again in may  the fcc issued two orders regulating the interstate access rates of competitive carriers 
under the rules imparted by the order  paetec s interstate rates were reduced in tiered increments to eventual parity with the rates of the incumbent carriers in each of the company s service areas 
beginning in june  in accordance with the order  paetec has designed its rates for interstate services provided to its own end users to equal the rates charged by the competing incumbent carrier for functionally equivalent access services  including all applicable fixed and traffic sensitive charges 
in the may order  the fcc announced a new rule that limits the access fees competitive carriers like paetec are able to collect from a long distance carrier in situations where the competitive carriers do not provide service directly to the end user 
this new rule specifically targeted traffic that competitive carriers handle for wireless carriers and provided that competitive carriers could charge no more than incumbent carriers for these services 
state regulatory commissions historically have regulated the intrastate access rates imposed by incumbent carriers but have regulated the intrastate access rates of competitive carriers less significantly 
several state regulatory commissions have begun to analyze intrastate access rates of competitive carriers and those ongoing proceedings may result in a change to the rates paetec assesses to long distance carriers for use of the company s in state networks 
both the fcc and state regulatory commissions continue to review rules regarding the compensation local carriers pay to other local carriers for termination of local telephone calls  known as reciprocal compensation 
rates and terms for reciprocal compensation are based on agreements between paetec and other local carriers and supported by federal and state regulatory and judicial rulings 
the company is engaged in continuing discussions with large incumbent carriers  among others  to perpetuate its contractual arrangements for reciprocal compensation in relevant service territories 
all forms of intercarrier compensation  both exchange access and reciprocal compensation  are now the subject of a generic proceeding at the fcc designed to reform the way carriers and providers pay other carriers and providers for use of their respective networks 
a recent filing at the fcc  known commonly as the missoula plan  is widely anticipated to be the blueprint for nationwide intercarrier compensation reform 
if implemented  such a plan could have a substantial effect on paetec s access revenues  network capital expenditures and cost of sales 
paetec is currently evaluating the plan to assess its potential effect on the company 
access fees and reciprocal compensation  as a percentage of total revenue  decreased to for from for  and for paetec experienced that the revenue it generates from access fees and reciprocal compensation as a percentage of total revenue stabilized at levels and then declined at a slower rate 
any future mandated rate decreases could further adversely affect the company s carrier services revenue and could adversely affect its gross margins and operating cash flow 
integrated solutions 
paetec derives revenue from sales to retail end user customers of telecommunications equipment and software and related services 
revenue from these integrated solutions represented approximately of paetec s total revenue for  and a portion of paetec s integrated solutions revenue consists of fees its customers pay for equipment and for paetec s system design and installation services 
paetec recognizes revenue for equipment sales and system design and installation services upon delivery and acceptance of the underlying equipment 
paetec derives an additional component of its integrated solutions revenue through selling and supporting its proprietary telecommunications software 
paetec recognizes revenue related to software sales upon delivery of the software 
support fees include fees for maintenance of paetec s telecommunications software and fees for training the end user in the proper use of paetec s telecommunications software 
paetec recognizes maintenance fees on a pro rata basis over the length of the underlying maintenance contract 
paetec recognizes training fees after it fulfills the training obligation 

table of contents cost of sales paetec provides its network services and carrier services by using electronic network components that it owns and telephone and data transmission lines that it leases from other telecommunication carriers 
paetec s cost of sales for these services consists primarily of leased transport charges and usage costs for local and long distance calls 
paetec s leased transport charges are the payments it makes to lease the telephone and data transmission lines that the company uses to connect its customers to its network and to connect its network to the networks of other carriers 
usage costs for local and long distance are the costs that paetec incurs for calls made by its customers 
cost of sales for paetec s integrated solutions also include the costs it incurs in designing systems and purchasing and installing equipment 
selling  general and administrative expenses paetec s selling  general and administrative expenses include selling and marketing  customer service  billing  corporate administration  engineering personnel and other personnel costs 
as paetec continues to expand its business  paetec expects that it will incur increased selling and marketing costs  which primarily reflect salaries of the company s direct sales force and commissions paid to its direct sales force and sales agents 
withdrawn initial public offering and related terminated new senior secured credit facility expenses on september   paetec withdrew its registration statement filed with the sec on april  related to a proposed initial public offering of common stock 
as a result  paetec wrote off approximately million of costs related to the withdrawn initial public offering and associated withdrawn new senior secured credit facility during recapitalization related costs on june   paetec completed a leveraged recapitalization to eliminate all outstanding shares of its series a convertible redeemable preferred stock before the optional redemption rights of the holders of those shares became effective in february  as well as the associated approval rights of the holders of those shares and the additional approval rights of the former stockholders of campuslink communications systems 
among other recapitalization transactions  paetec repurchased all outstanding shares of its series a convertible redeemable preferred stock and specified outstanding shares of its class a common stock  for a purchase price payable in cash 
paetec funded the purchase price in part with proceeds of borrowings under new senior secured credit facilities 
immediately before the series a preferred stock repurchase  specified shares of the series a preferred stock were converted into class a common stock in accordance with the existing terms of the series a preferred stock 
in addition  as part of the leveraged recapitalization  holders of paetec s class b common stock agreed to convert all of the outstanding shares of class b common stock into an equal number of shares of class a common stock and a right to receive a total of million additional shares of class a common stock in connection with the conversion 
the leveraged recapitalization also included paetec s cash repurchase of specified options to purchase class a common stock issued in connection with paetec s acquisition by merger of campuslink communications systems  inc to induce specified initial stockholders of paetec to provide the consents  approvals  waivers  releases and other agreements necessary to complete the other leveraged recapitalization transactions  paetec issued and sold  shares of class a common stock for no additional consideration to these initial stockholders 
paetec used the proceeds from the new senior secured credit facilities  in part  to pay some or all of the total cash required to complete the leveraged recapitalization transactions and to pay off or refinance substantially all of the company s then existing debt  including its then existing senior secured credit facility and capital leases 
paetec s board of directors approved the grant of equity based and cash incentive awards to certain senior executives for services in connection with the leveraged recapitalization and to promote the retention of the executives following the completion of the leveraged recapitalization 
these awards included total cash bonuses of million and grants of restricted stock units for million shares of class a common stock  which vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant 
the cash bonuses were paid upon completion of the leveraged recapitalization and were subject to specified repayment provisions that could have resulted in an executive s repayment of some or all of the bonus upon the occurrence of specified events during the full calendar months following the month in which the bonuses were paid 
in august  paetec entered into agreements with each executive who had received one of these cash bonuses  under which paetec agreed to terminate the repayment provisions to which the bonuses were originally subject 
these termination agreements were entered into to induce the executives to take actions or enter into or consent to agreements related to the execution of the merger agreement  including amendments to severance agreements and consents to incentive plan amendments that would preclude the completion of the mergers from triggering potential accelerated payments or accelerated vesting of equity awards held by the executives 
as a result of these cash bonus transactions  paetec recorded a charge of million  which is included in income from operations for 
table of contents series a repurchase as part of the leveraged recapitalization  the series a preferred stockholders converted  outstanding shares of series a preferred stock into  shares of class a common stock immediately before paetec s repurchase of the remaining  outstanding shares of series a preferred stock  including accrued dividends  for cash 
the total cash paid by paetec in connection with the conversion and repurchase was million  of which million represented the payment of accrued dividends on the converted and repurchased shares of series a preferred stock

in accordance with the agreement  as modified in january  these additional shares were issued in january paetec determined that the fair value of the shares of class b common stock on june  was equal to the fair value of the million shares of class a common stock received by the class b stockholders 
see note to paetec s consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the conversion of the class b common stock

table of contents fair value of common stock paetec determined the illiquid  non marketable fair value of its class a common stock as of june  based upon its capitalization structure after the leveraged recapitalization using the class a common stock price negotiated as part of the leveraged recapitalization 
paetec assessed the reasonableness of this price by performing an internal valuation analysis similar to the periodic analysis applied to determine the fair value of the class a common stock from time to time in connection with granting stock options to employees 
this analysis used paetec s projected future cash flows  discounted at a rate that reflects both paetec s weighted average cost of capital and the lack of liquidity of the class a common stock  and an implied market value analysis based on the stock price performance of comparable public peers within the competitive carrier industry 
based on this analysis  paetec determined that the illiquid  non marketable fair value of the class a common stock was equal to per share on june  paetec determined the liquid  marketable fair value of the class a common stock at june  based upon its capitalization structure immediately before the leveraged recapitalization  using the class a common stock price negotiated as part of the leveraged recapitalization 
paetec assessed the reasonableness of this price by performing an internal valuation analysis similar to the periodic analysis applied to determine the fair value of the class a common stock from time to time in connection with granting stock options to employees 
however  this analysis used paetec s projected future cash flows  discounted at a rate that reflects paetec s weighted average cost of capital  and did not include a discount for the lack of liquidity of the class a common stock  and an implied market value analysis based on the stock price performance of comparable public peers within the competitive carrier industry 
based on this analysis  paetec determined that the liquid  marketable fair value of the class a common stock based upon its capitalization structure immediately before the leveraged recapitalization was per share 
this price was used to determine the accounting impact of the class b common stock conversion transaction and the repurchase of the shares and options from the former stockholders of campuslink communications  as these transactions were negotiated based on the undiscounted  fully liquid value of the class a common stock

accounting for income taxes paetec recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of transactions and events 
under this method  paetec determines deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which it expects the differences to reverse 
if necessary  paetec reduces deferred income tax assets by a valuation allowance to an amount that it determines is more likely than not to be recoverable 
paetec makes significant estimates and assumptions about future taxable income and future tax consequences to determine the amount of the valuation allowance 

table of contents stock based compensation paetec s employees participate in the paetec corp 
stock option and incentive plan and the paetec corp 
incentive compensation plan 
paetec s officers also participate in the paetec corp 
executive incentive plan  which the company adopted on june  also in connection with the leveraged recapitalization 
the executive incentive plan provides for the issuance of restricted stock units for a total of million shares of class a common stock 
all restricted stock units outstanding under the executive incentive plan as of december  were issued in connection with the leveraged recapitalization 
effective january   paetec adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective method and  therefore  the company has not restated prior periods results 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense is recorded for the unvested portion of previously issued awards that remain outstanding at january  using the same estimate of grant date fair value and the same attribution method used to determine the pro forma disclosure under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted on or after january  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with sfas no 
r 
paetec recognizes these compensation costs  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
for  the total compensation expense related to stock options awarded under the paetec corp 
stock option and incentive plan was million  net of a deferred income tax benefit of million 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to unvested stock options granted under the paetec s equity incentive plans 
that expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
before the adoption of sfas r  paetec accounted for share based payments using the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
when options were granted with exercise prices below fair value  compensation expense was recorded for awards of options over the period earned 
however  in most cases  paetec did not recognize any compensation expense in connection with option awards to employees  since the exercise price of the option on the date of grant generally approximated the fair market value of the company s underlying class a common stock on that date 
for  the total compensation expense related to restricted stock units awarded under the executive incentive plan was million  net of a deferred income tax benefit of million 
this amount does not include any amount attributable to stock units granted in august from the paetec corp 
stock option and incentive plan  since the vesting of these stock units was contingent upon the completion of the mergers 
as a result  paetec was deferring recognition of the compensation expense attributable to these stock units until the completion of the mergers 
as of december   there was unrecognized stock based compensation expense of million related to unvested restricted stock unit awards granted under the executive incentive plan 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
free cash flow presentation free cash flow  as defined by paetec  consists of net cash provided by used in operating activities less net cash used in investing activities 
free cash flow  as defined by paetec  may not be similar to free cash flow measures presented by other companies  is not a financial measurement prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  and should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  the information contained in paetec s statement of cash flows presented in its consolidated financial statements 
paetec s management believes free cash flow provides a measure of its ability  after making its capital expenditures and acquisition expenditures  to meet scheduled debt payments 
paetec s management uses free cash flow to monitor the effect of the company s operations on its cash reserves and its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to fund paetec s scheduled debt maturities and other financing activities  including potential discretionary refinancings and retirements of debt 
because free cash flow represents the amount of cash generated or used in operating activities and investing activities before deductions for scheduled debt maturities  dividend payments and other fixed obligations  such as capital leases and vendor financing arrangements  and because it is not a financial measure prepared in accordance with gaap  you should not use it as a measure of the amount of cash available for discretionary expenditures 
free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities  as calculated in accordance with gaap  as a measure of liquidity

paetec s adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure used by paetec s management  together with gaap measures such as revenue and cash flows from operations  to assess paetec s historical and prospective operating performance 
management believes that trends in paetec s adjusted ebitda are a valuable indicator of paetec s ability to produce operating cash flow to fund working capital needs  to service debt obligations and to fund capital expenditures 
management uses adjusted ebitda to enhance its understanding of paetec s core operating performance  which represents management s views concerning paetec s performance in the ordinary  ongoing and customary course of its operations 
paetec s calculation of adjusted ebitda excludes the following costs  none of which management views as expenses relevant to its assessment of paetec s core operating performance costs paetec incurred in connection with the initial public offering it withdrew in and related terminated new senior secured credit facility  costs paetec incurred in connection with the leveraged recapitalization it completed in june  including change in fair market value of series a convertible redeemable preferred stock conversion rights  leveraged recapitalization related costs and loss on extinguishment of debt  and stock based compensation expense 
paetec s management also uses adjusted ebitda to evaluate paetec s performance relative to that of its competitors 
this financial measure permits a comparative assessment of paetec s operating performance  relative to the company s performance based on its gaap results  while isolating the effects of depreciation and amortization  which may vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance  and of stock based compensation  which is a non cash expense that varies widely among similar companies 
management believes that adjusted ebitda is a particularly useful comparative measure within paetec s industry 
the communications industry has experienced recent trends of increased merger and acquisition activity and financial restructurings 
these activities have led to significant non operating charges to earnings  such as those resulting from debt restructurings  and to significant variations among companies with respect to capital structures and cost of capital which affect interest expense and differences in taxation and book depreciation of facilities and equipment which affect relative depreciation expense  including significant differences in the depreciable lives of similar assets among various companies 
adjusted ebitda facilitates company to company comparisons in the communications industry by eliminating some of the foregoing variations 
paetec provides information relating to its adjusted ebitda so that analysts  investors and other interested persons have the same data that management uses to assess paetec s core operating performance 
management believes that providing this information permits the foregoing persons to obtain a better understanding of paetec s core operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure such performance on a standalone and a comparative basis 
paetec s adjusted ebitda may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in accounting policies and items excluded or included in the adjustments  which limits its usefulness as a comparative measure 
in addition  adjusted ebitda has other limitations as an analytical financial measure 
these limitations include the following adjusted ebitda does not reflect paetec s capital expenditures  future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments to purchase capital equipment  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  associated with paetec s indebtedness  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will likely have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect the effect of earnings or charges resulting from matters that paetec s management considers not indicative of paetec s ongoing operations 
paetec s management compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on paetec s gaap results to evaluate its operating performance and by considering independently the economic effects of the foregoing items that are not reflected in adjusted ebitda 
as a result of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss  as calculated in accordance with gaap  as a measure of operating performance  nor should it be considered as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity

compared with revenue 
total revenue increased million  or  to million for from million for revenue from network services increased million  or  to for from million for revenue from carrier services increased million  or  to million for from million for revenue from integrated solutions increased million  or  to million for from million for the increases in total revenue and revenue generated by network services and carrier services primarily resulted from an increase in the number of digital t transmission lines in service  from  lines as of december  to  lines as of december  of the lines in service as of december   approximately were attributable to paetec s network services business and approximately were attributable to its carrier services business 
in addition  paetec s acquisition of american long lines  inc in february accounted for approximately million of the increase in total revenue for the increase in revenue from integrated solutions was primarily due to new customer contracts signed during cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to million for from million for in each period  cost of sales consisted primarily of leased transport charges and usage costs for local and long distance calls 
in  cost of sales also included a credit of approximately million from one of paetec s largest vendors for a network services discount based on cumulative purchases from june  through march   of which approximately million was based on purchases during and was included in cost of sales for paetec did not recognize approximately million of the credit over the discount period  because  before the recognition of the credit  the company did not believe that it would achieve the level of cumulative purchases required to earn the credit 
during  paetec entered into a new agreement with the vendor related to discounts on purchases of network services 
at that time  paetec reached an agreement with the vendor that it had satisfied the criteria to earn a credit under the prior agreement and that the amount of the credit was million 
cost of sales in also included the effects of a credit of million that paetec recognized from a litigation settlement 

table of contents leased transport charges increased to million  or of cost of sales  for from million  or of cost of sales  for the increase in leased transport charges was primarily attributable to increases in the amount of network services paetec sold in usage costs for local and long distance calls increased to million  or of cost of sales  for from million  or of cost of sales  for the increase in usage costs was primarily attributable to increases in the amount of network and carrier services paetec sold in  and was partially offset by a decrease in the average usage rates the company is charged by network providers 
cost of sales as a percentage of total revenue increased from for to for this increase was primarily attributable to investments in paetec s network on new products and a credit the company received from one of its largest suppliers during  as previously discussed 
these increases were partially offset by the amount of voice and data services that paetec provided using its own network and facilities  and network efficiencies the company achieved by aggregating network traffic using points of presence located near clusters of its customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries  wages and benefits of million mainly due to a charge of million related to cash bonuses awarded to senior executives in connection with the june leveraged recapitalization and an increase in paetec s total number of employees from approximately  at december  to approximately  at december  the increase was also attributable to an increase of million in sales commissions related to increased total revenue  an increase in stock based compensation of approximately million due to the adoption of sfas no 
r and the grant of restricted stock units to certain executives in connection with the leveraged recapitalization in  an increase of approximately million in computer hardware maintenance costs related primarily to additional computer equipment in service and an increase of million related to a judgment against paetec regarding disputed access charges 
due to the grant of restricted stock units to certain executives in connection with the leveraged recapitalization and in connection with the us lec merger agreement  we anticipate recognizing compensation expense related to these stock unit awards of approximately million over a weighted average period of years 
selling  general and administrative expenses for include million of costs related to paetec s withdrawn public offering and the related terminated new senior secured credit facility 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to for from for primarily because the rate at which paetec has increased its total revenue has exceeded the rate at which it has hired new employees 
recapitalization related costs 
in  paetec s operating expenses include charges of approximately million for costs related to the leveraged recapitalization  including transaction costs of approximately million 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily attributable to increased depreciation expense resulting from an increase of million in gross property and equipment since december  as part of paetec s network deployment and maintenance 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was offset in part as paetec ceased to record depreciation on some of its older equipment that had reached the end of its depreciable life 
change in fair value of series a convertible redeemable preferred stock conversion right 
change in fair value of series a convertible redeemable preferred stock conversion right resulted in income of million for compared to an expense of million in subsequent to the end of the second quarter of  but before the issuance of its second quarter financial statements  paetec withdrew its registration statement that it filed with the sec on april  and ceased its effort to complete an initial public offering of common stock 
before the second quarter of  paetec did not ascribe any value to the conversion right of the series a convertible redeemable preferred stock  as the company believed it would be able to convert the preferred stock into common stock before the holders of the series a preferred stock would be able to require paetec to repurchase the series a preferred stock at fair value 
from the second quarter of through march   the embedded derivative was recorded at fair value  with any change in fair value recognized in current operations 
the fair value of the embedded derivative was determined based on a number of assumptions including the liquidity and volatility of paetec s stock 
as a result of paetec s repurchase of all outstanding series a preferred stock pursuant to the leveraged recapitalization  the series a preferred stock conversion right no longer exists 
the fair value of the series a preferred stock conversion right was as of june   as a result of the completion of the leveraged recapitalization 
the change in fair value from march  to june  was recorded as income in 
table of contents loss on extinguishment of debt 
as a result of the leveraged recapitalization  paetec incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately million for attributable to the write off of million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the extinguishment of the company s existing senior secured credit facility and lease termination fees of million related to the termination of its capital leases 
other income  net 
other income  net increased to million for from million for  primarily as a result of an increase in interest income and an increase in other financing income 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for from million for  primarily as a result of higher average outstanding debt balances during  higher average interest rates  and the discontinuance of hedge accounting on paetec s interest rate swap agreements during  which decreased interest expense for that period by million 
the average outstanding balances on paetec s senior secured credit facilities were million for and million for as of december   borrowing rates were and under paetec s first and second lien credit agreements  respectively 
as of december   borrowing rates under the senior credit facility agreement averaged 
income taxes 
paetec s effective income tax rate was for and for excluding the million charge in that resulted from the change in fair value of the series a preferred stock conversion right  paetec s effective tax rate would have been for that period 
of the million in charges related to the leveraged recapitalization  million related to the repurchase of paetec stock 
as such  these costs are non deductible for tax purposes 
excluding the million of charges relating to the repurchase of stock  as well as the million in income that resulted from the fair value of the series a preferred stock conversion right  paetec s effective income tax rate would have been for the increase in the company s effective rate from december  to december  was primarily due to the adoption of sfas no 
r  and the corresponding million in iso stock based compensation expense 
as of december   paetec had approximately million in net operating loss carryforwards  or nols 
as a result  the company only has been required to pay accrued alternative minimum taxes and state income taxes 
paetec conducted an analysis of the impact that the leveraged recapitalization had on the company s ability to utilize its nols 
the analysis concluded that paetec incurred a change in ownership within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code irc section as a result of the leveraged recapitalization on june  in general  irc section places annual limitations on the use of certain tax attributes such as net operating losses and tax credit carryovers in existence at the ownership change date 
as such  as of december   the million pre change net operating losses will be subject to an annual limitation under irc section the analysis concluded that an annual limitation of approximately million will be imposed on these nols 
to the extent the company has a net unrealized built in gain nubig at the date of the ownership change  the limitation may be increased during the first five years following the ownership change pursuant to irc section and published notices 
the analysis supports the conclusion that a nubig existed at the date of the ownership change providing for the increase in the annual limitation by approximately million during the five year period immediately following the ownership change that occurred on june  based on this conclusion  a combined nol limitation of million will exist on paetec s nols during the five years immediately following the ownership change  and an annual limitation of million will exist thereafter 
the overall analysis supports the company s ability to use its pre change deferred tax assets related to the nols prior to their expiration 
net income 
net income decreased by million  from net income of million for to net income of million in the decrease was primarily attributable to the completion of the leveraged recapitalization in june compared with revenue 
total revenue increased million  or  to million for from million for revenue from network services increased million  or  to million for from million for revenue from carrier services increased million  or  to million for from million for revenue from integrated solutions increased million  or  to million for from million for the increases in total revenue and revenue generated by network services and carrier services primarily resulted from an increase in the number of digital t transmission lines in service from  lines as of december  to  lines as of december  of the lines in service as of december   were attributable to paetec s network services business and were attributable to paetec s carrier services business 
paetec s acquisition of assets from covista communications in august and paetec s acquisition of american long lines in february of together accounted for approximately million of the increase in total revenue for 
table of contents the increase in revenue from integrated solutions during primarily resulted from the following an increase in revenue of approximately million during from phone system sales  additional sales to existing integrated solutions customers  and increased sales of equipment to network services customers  and an increase in revenue from the sale of software products of approximately million  which was primarily due to new customer contracts signed during the period 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in managed services revenue  which includes billing and customer care services for the telecommunications resale programs of universities  of approximately million during paetec believes the decrease was primarily due to wireless substitution by some of its college and university customers 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to million for from million for in each period  cost of sales consisted primarily of leased transport charges and usage costs for local and long distance calls 
in  cost of sales included the effects of a credit of approximately million paetec recognized from a litigation settlement and a credit of approximately million from one of paetec s largest vendors for a network services discount based on cumulative purchases from june  through march   of which approximately million was based on purchases during and included in cost of sales for paetec did not recognize approximately million of the credit over the discount period  because  before the recognition of the credit  paetec did not believe that it would achieve the level of cumulative purchases required to earn the credit 
during the three month period ended march   paetec entered into a new agreement with the vendor related to discounts on purchases of network services 
at that time  paetec reached an agreement with the vendor that the company had satisfied the criteria to earn a credit under the prior agreement and that the amount of the credit was million 
leased transport charges increased to million  or of cost of sales  for from million  or of cost of sales  for the increase in leased transport charges was primarily attributable to increases in the amount of network services paetec sold in usage costs for local and long distance calls increased to million  or of cost of sales  for from million  or of cost of sales  for the increase in usage costs was primarily attributable to increases in the amount of network and carrier services paetec sold in  and was partially offset by a decrease in the average usage rates paetec is charged by network providers 
the increase in usage costs as a percentage of cost of sales was primarily attributable to fluctuations in the mix of products sold during those periods 
cost of sales as a percentage of total revenue increased from for to for this increase was primarily attributable to reductions in the rates paetec charges interexchange carriers  or ixcs  for interstate switched access services that were required by regulations  investments in paetec s network on new products and the transition to paetec s network of customers of acquired businesses 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in the amount of voice and data services that paetec provides using its own network and facilities  network efficiencies the company achieved by aggregating network traffic using points of presence located near clusters of its customers  and paetec s receipt of the vendor credit described above 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for the total increase was attributable to an increase in salaries  wages and benefits of million primarily related to an increase in paetec s total number of employees from approximately  at december  to approximately  at december   an increase of million in sales commissions related to increased total revenue  and an increase of million in facility costs primarily related to additional sales offices in washington  dc and pennsylvania and a new switch site in new jersey 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to for from for  primarily because the rate at which paetec has increased its total revenue has exceeded the rate at which the company has hired new employees 
the decrease also is due in part to paetec s acquisition of assets from covista communications in august and its acquisition of american long lines in february of  which together increased revenue for by approximately million  but also increased selling  general and administrative expenses for the same period by approximately million  or of the increased revenue 
withdrawn initial public offering and related terminated new senior secured credit facility expenses 
on september   paetec requested the withdrawal of its registration statement on form s filed with the securities and exchange commission on april  as a result  approximately million of costs related to the withdrawn initial public offering and the related terminated new senior secured credit facility were written off during 
table of contents depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for from million for the increase was largely attributable to increased depreciation expense resulting from an increase of million in gross property and equipment since december  as part of paetec s network deployment and maintenance 
amortization expense also increased as a result of an increase in gross intangible assets of million from paetec s acquisition in august of assets from covista communications and paetec s acquisition in february of american long lines 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was offset in part as paetec ceased to record depreciation on some of its older equipment that had reached the end of its useful life 
change in fair value of series a convertible redeemable preferred stock conversion right 
change in fair value of series a convertible redeemable preferred stock conversion right increased to million in from in subsequent to the end of the second quarter of  but before the issuance of paetec s second quarter financial statements  paetec withdrew the registration statement that it filed with the sec on april  and ceased its effort to complete an initial public offering of common stock 
before the second quarter of  paetec did not ascribe any value to the conversion right  as the company believed it would be able to convert the series a convertible redeemable preferred stock into common stock before the holders of the preferred stock would be able to require paetec to repurchase the preferred stock at fair value 
before its repurchase of all outstanding shares of the series a convertible redeemable preferred stock in june  paetec believed that it was reasonably possible that it would not be able to convert the series a convertible redeemable preferred stock to common stock before the mandatory redemption date 
as a result  paetec adjusted its probability weighted average calculation of fair value of the conversion right to reflect this change in assumption 
paetec valued this embedded derivative at december  based on a black scholes probability weighted calculation using a volatility factor assumption  a risk free interest rate and an estimate of ascribed to the fair value of a share of paetec common stock as of december  paetec determined that the fair market value of the embedded derivative was million and recorded the amount as a liability as of december  interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million for from million for  primarily as a result of a lower average outstanding debt balance during and due to the discontinuance of hedge accounting on paetec s interest rate swap agreements  which decreased interest expense by million during the hedge accounting on paetec s interest rate swap agreements was discontinued as of june   when the company concluded that the projected cash flows of its existing variable rate debt were no longer probable due to paetec s planned refinancing of its senior secured credit facility 
because the interest rate swaps outstanding as of june  accordingly no longer qualified for hedge accounting  paetec reclassified during the three months ended june  million associated with its hedge accounting from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense was partially offset by an increase in average interest rates applicable to paetec s variable rate debt 
as of december  and  borrowing rates under the senior credit facility agreement averaged and  respectively 
other income  net 
other income  net increased to million for from million for  primarily as a result of an increase in interest income and an increase in other financing income 
income taxes 
paetec recorded income tax provisions of million  which represented an effective income tax rate of  for  and an income tax benefit of million  which represented an effective income tax rate of  for excluding the million charge that resulted from the change in the fair value of the series a convertible redeemable preferred stock conversion right  paetec s effective income tax rate would have been for the income tax benefit in included the effects of a non cash net deferred income tax benefit for of approximately million  which was partially offset by current income tax expense of million for the non cash net deferred income tax benefit for was the result of a reversal of substantially all of paetec s previously existing valuation allowance 
during the third quarter of  paetec performed its regular assessment of its deferred income tax valuation allowance and determined that portions of the allowance should be reversed 
the evaluation considered profitability of the business  the ability to use these deferred income tax assets against future profitable amounts  and possible restrictions on use due to limits as to the number of years over which the deferred income tax assets can be carried forward and to annual use limits associated with section of the internal revenue code 
this reversal of substantially all of the valuation allowance resulted in a non cash deferred income tax benefit for of approximately million and a reduction of goodwill by million 
as of december   paetec had approximately million in net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result  paetec currently only pays alternative minimum taxes and state income taxes 
net income 
net income decreased by million  from million for to million for 
table of contents seasonality paetec s historical operating results experienced some seasonality primarily relating to the portion of revenue the company derives from sales to customers in the higher education and hospitality industries 
paetec expects that the revenue it derives from customers in these industries generally will be lower in the summer months as a result of reduced student enrollments and business related travel during these months 
in addition  the amount of revenue paetec generates from most of its business customers is based  in part  on the amount of services used by the customer  which is subject to seasonal variations based on the number of work days and employee vacation days in each quarter 
many of paetec s customers generate less usage based revenue for it during the summer months and the month of december 
critical accounting policies paetec s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions 
of paetec s significant accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  paetec believes that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition 
paetec generates recurring operating revenue pursuant to contracts with paetec s customers and non recurring revenue pursuant to non recurring agreements 
paetec recognizes revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require satisfaction of the following four basic criteria before revenue can be recognized there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
paetec bases its determination of the third and fourth criteria above on the company s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee it has charged for the services rendered and products delivered  and the prospects that those fees will be collected 
if changes in conditions should cause it to determine that these criteria likely will not be met for some future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be materially adversely affected 
management makes estimates of future customer credits through the analysis of historical trends and known events 
the provisions for revenue adjustments are recorded as a reduction of revenue when incurred 
since any revenue allowances are recorded as an offset to revenue  any future increases or decreases in the allowances will positively or negatively affect revenue by the same amount 
during  paetec adopted the provisions of the emerging issues task force  or eitf  bulletin no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf no 
provides additional guidance on revenue recognition for transactions that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services or rights to use assets  and performance that may occur at different points in time or over different periods of time 
the adoption of eitf no 
did not have an effect on paetec s results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
network services and carrier services revenue 
paetec derives revenue primarily from its sale of communications services 
paetec s service revenue consists principally of usage fees and monthly recurring fees 
usage fees consist of fees paid by paetec s customers for each call made  fees paid by the incumbent carriers in paetec s markets as reciprocal compensation when the company terminates local calls made by their customers  and access fees paid by carriers for long distance calls that paetec originates and terminates 
paetec recognizes revenue related to usage fees when the service is provided 
paetec bills usage fees in arrears and uses estimates to recognize revenue for unbilled usage fees 
paetec s ability to generate reciprocal compensation revenue and access revenue is subject to numerous regulatory and legal proceedings 
until these proceedings are ultimately resolved  paetec s policy is to recognize reciprocal compensation and access revenue only when the company concludes that its realization of that revenue is reasonably assured 
monthly recurring fees include the fees paid by paetec s customers for lines in service and additional features on those lines 
monthly recurring fees are paid by paetec s end user customers and are billed in advance 
paetec recognizes this revenue during the period in which it is earned 

table of contents paetec has arrangements where it recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  which requires some non recurring service activation and installation fee revenues that are payable in advance of the provision of services to be deferred over the average customer life 
in accordance with those guidelines  paetec defers service activation and installation fee revenues and related costs and amortizes them over the average customer life  primarily three years 
integrated solutions revenue 
paetec also derives revenue from sales of telecommunications equipment and software 
equipment revenue consists of fees paetec s customers pay for equipment and for paetec s system design and installation services 
paetec recognizes equipment revenue upon delivery and acceptance of the equipment 
paetec derives software revenue through selling and supporting its proprietary telecommunications software 
paetec recognizes revenue related to software sales upon delivery and acceptance of the software in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants and related interpretations 
support fees include fees for maintenance of paetec s telecommunications software and fees for training the end user in the proper use of paetec s telecommunications software 
paetec recognizes maintenance fees pro rata over the length of the underlying maintenance contract 
paetec recognizes training fees after the training obligation has been fulfilled 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
to determine paetec s allowance for bad debts  it uses estimates based on the company s historical collection experience  its assessment of current industry and economic trends  customer concentrations and its credit policies 
as of december   paetec had reserved for million of bad debts 
paetec has reserved for expected bad debt losses based on the factors referred to above  and believes that its reserves are adequate 
it is possible  however  that the sufficiency of paetec s estimates could become materially inadequate as the composition of paetec s receivables changes over time 
paetec continually reviews and refines the estimation process to take account of these changes  but from time to time the company may need to adjust its estimate to reflect actual experience 
cost of sales 
costs of sales are composed primarily of network costs  which are costs incurred for leased transport charges and for transmission of voice and data services over other carriers networks 
these costs consist of both fixed payments and variable amounts based on actual usage and negotiated or regulated contract rates 
paetec expenses network costs as incurred 
these costs include paetec s estimate of charges for which it has not yet received bills  and are based upon the estimated number of transmission lines and facilities paetec has in service and its estimated minutes of use based on internal reports 
once paetec receive an invoice from a carrier  the company begins a process of reconciling that carrier s invoice to paetec s internal reports 
once the reconciliation is complete  paetec follows contractual terms to dispute any erroneous billing and  ultimately  agree with the carrier on the final amount due 
in some cases  this reconciliation process can take several months to complete 
paetec may make subsequent adjustments to its estimates after the company receives bills for the actual costs it incurs  but it generally does not expect that these adjustments will be material to its operating results 
accordingly  paetec s accrual for network costs includes estimates for which the reconciliation of the carriers invoices to the company s internal reports has not been completed 
because of the significance of access costs  the complexity of the systems that capture accrual information and the quantity of negotiated and regulated rates  paetec believes that the estimation of network cost accruals is a critical accounting policy 
impairment of long lived assets 
it is paetec s policy to review its long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors the company considers important  and which could trigger an impairment review  include the following significant under performance of paetec s assets relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner in which paetec uses its assets or in its overall business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in fair market value of paetec s common stock for a sustained period 
paetec determines whether the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the foregoing or other indicators of impairment 
paetec determines if impairment exists relating to long lived assets by comparing future undiscounted cash flows to the asset s carrying value 
if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows  paetec measures the impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in paetec s current business model or another appropriate valuation methodology for comparison to the carrying value 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  paetec does not amortize goodwill or other acquired intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
paetec has identified two reporting units as defined in sfas no 
goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually  based upon paetec s estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit 
currently  paetec does not have any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 

table of contents paetec assesses the carrying value of its goodwill during the third quarter of each fiscal year 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill of a reporting unit will also be tested for impairment between annual tests if a triggering event occurs  as defined by sfas no 
 that could potentially reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
the   and annual assessment of the carrying value of paetec s goodwill indicated that the value of the remaining goodwill was not impaired as of july    and  respectively 
the changes in the carrying value of goodwill from january  through december  were as follows in thousands balance as of january and december  goodwill related to acquisition of assets from covista communications  inc recognition of acquired net operating losses balance as of december  goodwill related to acquisition of american long lines  inc purchase accounting adjustment balance as of december  and december  paetec reduced goodwill by million during primarily as a result of a purchase accounting adjustment related to the acquisition of assets from covista communications 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in goodwill of million attributable to the company s acquisition of american long lines  inc because of the significance of long lived assets and the judgments and estimates that go into the impairment analysis  paetec believes that its policies regarding impairment of long lived assets are critical 
share based payment 
employees of paetec participate in the paetec corp 
stock option and incentive plan and the paetec corp 
incentive compensation plan 
officers of paetec also participate in the paetec corp 
executive incentive plan 
on january   paetec adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires the measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render service 
paetec adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method and  therefore  the company has not restated results for prior periods 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense is recorded for the unvested portion of previously issued awards that remain outstanding at january  using the same estimate of grant date fair value and the same attribution method used to determine the pro forma disclosure under sfas no 
stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted on or after january  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with sfas no 
r 
paetec recognizes these compensation costs ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model that uses the following assumptions expected volatilities are based on a volatility factor computed with the assistance of an independent third party  based upon an external peer group analysis of publicly traded companies based in the united states within a predetermined market capitalization range  which are referred to as public comparables 
the analysis provides historical and implied volatilities of the public comparables and develops an estimate of constant expected volatility for paetec 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the vesting period of the award  as well as exercisability of the award  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is calculated using the us treasury yield curve  and is based on the expected term of the option 
paetec uses historical data to estimate forfeitures 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and paetec uses different assumptions  its stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  paetec is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the company s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what paetec has recorded in the current period 

table of contents before the adoption of sfas r  paetec accounted for compensation cost under its option plans using the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and had adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
when appropriate  compensation expense was recorded for awards of options over the period earned 
however  in most cases paetec had not recognized any compensation expense in connection with option awards to employees  since the exercise price of the option on the date of grant generally approximated the fair market value of underlying class a common stock on that date 
income taxes 
paetec accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the asset and liability approach underlying sfas no 
requires the recognition of deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
management provides valuation allowances against the net deferred income tax asset for amounts that are not considered more likely than not to be realized 
paetec must make significant estimates and assumptions about future taxable income and future tax consequences when determining the amount of the valuation allowance 
paetec considers all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is needed for some portion or all of a net deferred income tax asset 
paetec uses judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
in arriving at these judgments  the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which such evidence can be objectively verified 
in the third quarter of  paetec evaluated the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance and determined that portions of the allowance should be reversed 
the evaluation considered profitability of the business  the ability to utilize these deferred income tax assets against future profitable amounts  and possible restrictions on use due to limits as to the number of years over which they can be carried forward and annual use limits associated with section of the internal revenue code 
paetec determined that it was more likely than not that the company would be able to make use of approximately million of the remaining net deferred income tax assets 
the reversal of substantially all of the valuation allowance resulted in a non cash net deferred income tax benefit for the twelve months ended december  of approximately million and a reduction of goodwill by million in connection with acquired net operating losses 
as of december   paetec maintained a valuation allowance of approximately million  which primarily relates to state net operating loss carryforwards that the company does not believe it is more likely than not to realize 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  paetec records tax contingencies when the exposure item becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
because of the significance of income taxes and the judgments and estimates that go into the calculation of income taxes  paetec believes that its income tax accounting policies are critical 
purchase accounting 
paetec accounts for the purchase of a business by allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the transaction at their respective estimated fair values 
the most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets 
paetec uses available information to make these fair value determinations and  when necessary  engages an independent valuation specialist to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long lived assets 
because of the inherent subjectivity associated with estimating the fair value of long lived assets  paetec believes that the recording of assets and liabilities acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of a business is a critical accounting policy 
on february   paetec announced that it had purchased american long lines  inc  a privately owned telecommunications company serving primarily small and medium sized business customers in the mid atlantic region  for approximately million in cash  of which approximately million was paid at closing and approximately million was paid during the six month period 
during the second quarter of  the american long lines purchase agreement was amended to alter the original payment schedule and payment methodology  resulting in the final purchase payment being made during the three months ended june  on february   paetec and us lec completed their combination pursuant to the merger agreement  dated as of august   as amended  among paetec  us lec  paetec holding  wc acquisition sub u corp  and wc acquisition sub p corp 
in accordance with the merger agreement  wc acquisition sub p corp 
merged with and into paetec the paetec merger and wc acquisition sub u corp 
merged with and into us lec the us lec merger and together with the paetec merger  the mergers 
paetec and us lec were the surviving corporations of the mergers and  as a result of the mergers  became wholly owned subsidiaries of paetec holding 
paetec holding will account for the mergers as a purchase of us lec by paetec using the purchase method of accounting under generally accepted accounting principles 
for federal income tax purposes  the paetec merger together with the us lec merger is intended to be treated as an integrated series of transfers under section of the internal revenue code 

table of contents derivatives 
sfas 
no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  and sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  allows the gains and losses of a derivative to offset related results on the hedged item in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income  and requires paetec to formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
paetec s freestanding derivative instruments are designated as hedges at inception and evaluated for effectiveness at least quarterly throughout the hedge period 
these derivatives are designated as hedges of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedge 
the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
paetec formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions 
this process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
paetec discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of a hedged item  the derivative or hedged item expires or is sold  terminated  or exercised  or management determines that it is no longer appropriate to designate the derivative as a hedge instrument 
as part of the leveraged recapitalization  paetec obtained borrowings under new senior secured credit facilities 
in connection with these new facilities  paetec had interest rate swaps at december  that qualified as cash flow hedges 
before their repurchase pursuant to the leveraged recapitalization in june  the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock were convertible at any time at the holder s option into shares of the class a common stock at a price of per share of class a common stock 
at any time after february   but not after the completion of a qualified public offering or a specified sale of the company  any holder of the series a preferred stock would have had the right to require paetec to repurchase for cash any or all of the outstanding shares of the series a preferred stock at fair market value  as defined in the agreement pursuant to which the series a preferred stock was issued 
paetec determined that the conversion right of the series a preferred stockholders combined with the cash repurchase right of the series a preferred stockholders represented an embedded derivative as defined in sfas no 
paetec accordingly has valued and bifurcated the embedded derivative from the host contract 
at each balance sheet date  the embedded derivative was recorded at fair value  with any change in fair value recognized in current operations 
the fair value of the embedded derivative was determined based on a number of assumptions including the liquidity and volatility of paetec s common stock 
as a result of the leveraged recapitalization  the fair value of the embedded derivative was reduced to as of june  self insurance reserves 
paetec is self insured for certain losses related to insurance  although the company maintains stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit exposures 
the estimate of paetec s self insurance liability contains uncertainty since the company must use judgment to estimate the ultimate cost that will be incurred to settle reported claims and claims for incidents incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
when estimating paetec s self insurance liability  the company considers a number of factors  which include  but are not limited to  historical claim experience  and known claims not yet paid 
paetec has not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish its self insurance liabilities during the past three fiscal years 
legal and contingency reserves 
paetec accounts for legal and other contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
loss contingencies are accrued by a charge to income if both of the following conditions are met information before issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements  and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the foregoing list of critical accounting policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of paetec s accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for paetec to judge their application 
there are also areas in which paetec s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
in addition to reviewing the foregoing list  paetec encourages you to review carefully the notes to its consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  where you will find a more comprehensive description of the company s accounting policies and additional disclosures that are required by generally accepted accounting principles

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk paetec is exposed to market risks in the normal course of business 
paetec manages the sensitivity of its results of operations to these risks by maintaining an investment portfolio consisting primarily of short term  interest bearing securities and by entering into long term debt obligations with appropriate pricing and terms 
paetec does not hold or issue derivative  derivative commodity or other financial instruments for trading purposes  although the company holds some derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
paetec does not have any material foreign currency exposure 
paetec s major market risk exposure is to changing interest rates associated with borrowings the company used to fund the expansion of its business and its historical operating losses 
the interest rates that paetec is able to obtain on this debt financing depend on market conditions 
paetec s policy is to manage interest rates through a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt and through use of interest rate swap contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on its variable rate debt 
at december   million of paetec s long term debt consisted of variable rate instruments that accrue interest at floating rates 
at the same date  through two interest rate swap contracts  paetec had capped its interest rate exposure through june  at a rate of on million of floating rate debt and through june  at a rate of on million of floating rate debt 
a change of one percentage point in the interest rates applicable to paetec s million of variable rate debt not subject to an interest rate swap contract at december  would result in a fluctuation of approximately million in paetec s annual interest expense
