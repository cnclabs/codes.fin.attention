management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and liquidity and capital resources contained within this form k is more clearly understood when read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes 
the notes to the financial statements provide information about us  as well as the basis for presentation used in this form k 
overview in october  we began operations upon the acquisition of all of the equity interests of origen financial llc we also took steps to qualify origen financial  inc as a reit 
in the second quarter of  we completed the initial public offering of our common stock 
currently  most of our operations are conducted through origen financial llc  our wholly owned subsidiary 
we conduct the rest of our business operations through our other wholly owned subsidiaries  including taxable reit subsidiaries  to take advantage of certain business opportunities and ensure that we comply with the federal income tax rules applicable to reits 
in june  moody s investors service assigned origen servicing  inc a rating of sq as a primary servicer of manufactured housing loans 
origen servicing  inc is a wholly owned subsidiary of origen financial  llc moody s rating is based on our above average collection ability and average financial stability 
in august  we completed our origen manufactured housing contract trust collateralized notes  series a transaction 
in this securitization  a special purpose subsidiary issued approximately million in asset backed certificates secured by manufactured housing contracts with two separate floating rate classes of aaa rated bonds 
additional credit enhancement was provided through the issuance of a financial guaranty insurance policy by ambac assurance corporation 
despite difficult industry conditions  including the inverted yield curve and another decline in manufactured housing shipments  we experienced a increase in loan origination volume in as compared to our portfolio performance  as measured by delinquencies  continued to improve as loans or more days delinquent decreased from of the loan portfolio at december  to at december  additionally  we have experienced improvements in recovery rates on the re marketing of repossessed or foreclosed assets 
the execution of our securitizations has continued to improve  as we have seen overcollateralization levels in our securitizations fall from for our a securitization to for our a securitization 
however  rising interest rates  the flattening yield curve and competition have prevented us from raising rates on our loans originated and as a result we have seen decreases in our interest rate margin 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to reserves for credit losses  recourse liabilities  servicing rights and retained interests in loans sold and securitized 
estimates are based on historical experience  information received from third parties and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under conditions different from our assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents securitizations structured as financings we engage in securitizations of our manufactured housing loan receivables 
we have structured all loan securitizations occurring since as financings for accounting purposes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
in the future  we intend to continue to structure and account for our securitizations as financings 
when a loan securitization is structured as a financing  the financed asset remains on our books along with the recorded liability that evidences the financing  typically bonds 
income from both the loan interest spread and the servicing fees received on the securitized loans are recorded into income as earned 
an appropriate allowance for credit losses is maintained on the loans 
deferred debt issuance costs and discount related to the bonds are amortized on a level yield basis over the estimated life of the bonds 
loans receivable loans receivable consist of manufactured housing loans under contracts collateralized by the borrowers manufactured houses and in some instances  related land 
all loans receivable are classified as held for investment and are carried at amortized cost  except for loans purchased with evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination  which are described below 
interest on loans is credited to income when earned 
loans receivable include accrued interest and are presented net of deferred loan origination fees and costs and an allowance for estimated loan losses 
allowance for loan losses determining an appropriate allowance for loan losses involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment 
the process of estimating the allowance for loan losses may result in either a specific amount representing the impairment estimate or a range of possible amounts 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  provides guidance on accounting for loan losses associated with pools of loans and requires the accrual of a loss when it is probable that an asset has been impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
our loan portfolio is comprised of manufactured housing loans with an average loan balance of less than  the allowance for loan losses is developed at the portfolio level and the amount of the allowance is determined by establishing a calculated range of probable losses 
a lower range of probable losses is calculated by applying historical loss rate factors to the loan portfolio on a stratified basis using current portfolio performance and delinquency levels days  days  days and greater than days delinquent 
an upper range of probable losses is calculated by the extrapolation of probable loan impairment based on the correlation of historical losses by vintage year of origination 
financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 reasonable estimation of the amount of a loss an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 states that a creditor should recognize the amount that is the best estimate within the estimated range of loan losses 
accordingly  the determination of an amount within the calculated range of losses is in recognition of the fact that historical charge off experience  without adjustment  may not be representative of current impairment of the current portfolio of loans because of changed circumstances 
such changes may relate to changes in the age of loans in the portfolio  changes in the creditor s underwriting standards  changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers in a geographic region  or changes in the business climate in a particular industry 
loan pools and debt securities acquired with evidence of deterioration of credit quality we account for loan pools and debt securities acquired with evidence of deterioration of credit quality at the time of acquisition in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa practice bulletin pb  amortization of discounts on certain acquired loans  as well as the aicpa s statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
the carrying values of such purchased loan pools and debt securities were approximately million and million  respectively  at december  and million and million  respectively  at december   and are included in loans receivable and investments held to maturity  respectively  in the consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents we adopted the provisions of sop in january and apply those provisions to loan pools and debt securities acquired after december  the provisions of sop that relate to decreases in expected cash flows amend pb for consistent treatment and apply prospectively to receivables acquired before january  purchased loans and debt instruments acquired before january  will continue to be accounted for under pb  as amended  for provisions related to decreases in expected cash flows 
under the provisions of sop  each static pool of loans and debt securities is statistically modeled to determine its projected cash flows 
we consider historical cash collections for loan pools and debt securities with similar characteristics as well as expected prepayments and estimate the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal  interest and other cash flows for each pool of loans and debt security 
an internal rate of return is calculated for each static pool of receivables based on the projected cash flows and applied to the balance of the static pool 
the resulting revenue recognized is based on the internal rate of return applied to the remaining balance of each static pool of accounts 
each static pool is analyzed at least quarterly to assess the actual performance compared to the expected performance 
to the extent there are differences in actual performance versus expected performance  the internal rate of return is adjusted prospectively to reflect the revised estimate of cash flows over the remaining life of the static pool 
beginning january  if revised cash flow estimates are less than the original estimates  sop requires that the internal rate of return remain unchanged and an immediate impairment be recognized 
for loans acquired with evidence of deterioration of credit quality  if cash flow estimates increase subsequent to recording an impairment  sop requires reversal of the previously recognized impairment before any increases to the internal rate of return are made 
for any remaining increases in estimated future cash flows for loan pools or debt securities acquired with evidence of deterioration of credit quality  we adjust the amount of accretable yield recognized on a prospective basis over the remaining life of the loan pool or debt security 
application of the interest method of accounting requires the use of estimates to calculate a projected internal rate of return for each pool 
these estimates are based on historical cash collections 
if future cash collections are materially different in amount or timing than projected cash collections  earnings could be affected  either positively or negatively 
higher collection amounts or cash collections that occur sooner than projected cash collections will have a favorable impact on yields and revenues 
lower collection amounts or cash collections that occur later than projected cash collections will have an unfavorable impact and result in an immediate impairment being recognized 
derivative financial instruments we have periodically used derivative instruments  including forward sales of us treasury securities  us treasury rate locks and forward interest rate swaps to mitigate interest rate risk related to our loans receivable and anticipated securitizations 
we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 

all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
on the date a derivative contract is entered into  we designate the derivative as a hedge of either a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flow to be paid cash flow hedge 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified  designated and highly effective as a cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income until earnings are affected by the forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flow and are then reported in current earnings 
any ineffectiveness is recorded in current earnings 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as the risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction 
this process includes linking cash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions or variability of cash flow 
we also formally assess  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flow of hedged items 
when it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge  we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively  in accordance with sfas derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized currently in earnings 

table of contents share based compensation in connection with our formation  we adopted an equity incentive plan 
we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  on january   using the modified prospective transition method  in order to account for our equity incentive plan 
in connection with the adoption of sfas r we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the amount of  to reflect the change in accounting for forfeitures 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
sfas r addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
under this pronouncement  all forms of share based payments to employees  including employee stock options  are treated the same as other forms of compensation by recognizing the related cost in the income statement 
the expense of the award would generally be measured at fair value at the grant date 
the fair value of each option granted would be determined using a binomial option pricing model based on assumptions related to annualized dividend yield  stock price volatility  risk free rate of return and expected average term 
prior to january   as permitted under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended  we chose to recognize compensation expense using the intrinsic value based method of valuing stock options prescribed in apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
under the intrinsic value based method  compensation cost is measured as the amount by which the quoted market price of our common stock at the date of grant exceeds the stock option exercise price 
all options we granted prior to the adoption of sfas r were granted at a fixed price not less than the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and  therefore  were not included in compensation expense  prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
goodwill impairment the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  require that recorded goodwill be tested for impairment on an annual basis 
the initial and on going estimate of our fair value is based on our assumptions and projections 
once determined  the amount is compared to our net book value to determine if a write down in the recorded value of the goodwill is necessary 
income taxes we have elected to be taxed as a reit as defined under section c of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
in order for us to qualify as a reit  at least ninety five percent of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources 
in addition  a reit must distribute at least ninety percent of its reit taxable net income to its stockholders 
qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations  and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
in addition  frequent changes occur in the area of reit taxation  which requires us to continually monitor our tax status 
we have received a legal opinion to the effect that based on various assumptions and qualifications set forth in the opinion  origen financial  inc has been organized and has operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a reit under the code for its taxable years ended december    and there is no assurance that the internal revenue service will not decide differently from the views expressed in counsel s opinion and such opinion represents only the best judgment of counsel and is not binding on the internal revenue service or the courts 

table of contents as a reit  we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on the ordinary taxable income we distribute to our stockholders as dividends 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  our taxable income will be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates including any applicable alternative minimum tax 
even if we qualify as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local income taxes and to us federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income 
in addition  taxable income from non reit activities managed through taxable reit subsidiaries  if any  is subject to federal and state income taxes 
an income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income generated by our taxable reit subsidiaries 
deferred tax components arise based upon temporary differences between the book and tax basis of items such as the allowance for loan losses  accumulated depreciation  share based compensation and goodwill 
financial condition december  compared to december  at december  and we held loans representing approximately million and million of principal balances  respectively 
net loans outstanding constituted over and of our total assets at december  and  respectively 
approximately million of the loans on our balance sheet at december  were included in our august securitization  and will continue to be carried on our balance sheet as the securitization transaction was structured as a financing 
to the extent loans on our balance sheet are eligible on an individual basis and not already included in our securitized pools  we plan to securitize such loans and issue asset backed bonds through periodic transactions in the asset backed securitization market 
the timing of any securitization will depend on prevailing market conditions and the availability of sufficient total loan balances to constitute an efficient transaction 
new loan originations for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to our focus on customer service and the use of technology to deliver our products and services

non performing loans as a percentage of average outstanding principal balance were for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the improvement in our asset quality statistics for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  reflects our continued emphasis on the credit quality of our borrowers and the improved underwriting and origination practices we have put into place 
lower levels of non performing assets and net charge offs should have a positive effect on future earnings through decreases in the provision for credit losses and servicing expenses as well as increases in net interest income 
at december  we held repossessed houses owned by us compared to houses at december   a decrease of houses  or

changes to our underwriting practices  processes  credit scoring models  systems and servicing techniques beginning in have resulted in demonstrably superior performance by loans originated in and subsequent to as compared to loans originated by our predecessors prior to the pre loans  despite representing a diminishing percentage of our owned loan portfolio  have had a disproportionate negative impact on our financial performance

while representing less than of the owned loan portfolio at december   the pre loans accounted for almost of the defaults and of the losses during additionally  recovery rates were substantially lower for the pre loans leading to higher losses as compared to loans from and later 
management believes that as these loans become a smaller percentage of the owned loan portfolio  the negative impact on earnings will diminish

during the year ended december  we incurred state taxes of million as compared to million during the year ended december  other operating expenses  which consist of occupancy and equipment  professional fees  travel and entertainment and miscellaneous expenses increased million  or  from million to million 
this increase is primarily the result of a million  or increase in professional fees from million to million 
the increase in professional fees is primarily due to sarbanes oxley compliance related costs 
occupancy and equipment  office expense and telephone expense increased a total of million  or  from million to million 
travel and entertainment expense was million during both and miscellaneous expenses were million during both and liquidity and capital resources we require capital to fund our loan originations  acquire manufactured housing loans originated by third parties and expand our loan servicing operations 
at december  we had approximately million in available cash and cash equivalents 
as a reit  we will be required to distribute at least of our reit taxable income as defined in the internal revenue code to our stockholders on an annual basis 
therefore  as a general matter  it is unlikely we will have any substantial cash balances that could be used to meet our liquidity needs 
instead  these needs must be met from cash provided from operations and external sources of capital 
historically  we have satisfied our liquidity needs through cash generated from operations  sales of our common and preferred stock  borrowings on our credit facilities and securitizations 
cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december   totaled million versus million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  versus million for the year ended december  cash used to originate and purchase loans decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  principal collections on loans totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in collections is primarily related to the increase in the average outstanding loan portfolio balance  which was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   in addition to improved credit quality and decreased delinquency as a percentage of outstanding loan receivable balance 
the primary source of cash during the year ended december  was our a securitized financing transaction completed in august we securitized approximately million in principal balance of manufactured housing loans  which was funded by issuing bonds of approximately million 
approximately million of proceeds was used to reduce the aggregate balance of notes outstanding under our citigroup warehouse financing facility 
continued access to the securitization market is very important to our business 
the proceeds from successful securitization transactions generally are applied to paying down our other short term credit facilities giving us renewed borrowing capacity to fund new loan originations 
numerous factors affect our ability to complete a successful securitization  including factors beyond our control 
these include general market interest rate levels  the shape of the yield curve and spreads between rates on us treasury obligations and securitized bonds  all of which affect investors demand for securitized debt 
in the event these factors are unfavorable our ability to successfully complete securitization transactions is impeded and our liquidity and capital resources are affected negatively 
there can be no assurance that current favorable conditions will continue or that unfavorable conditions will not return 

table of contents we currently have a short term securitization facility used for warehouse financing with citigroup 
under the terms of the agreement  originally entered into in march and amended periodically  most recently in july  we pledge loans as collateral and in turn we are advanced funds 
the facility has a maximum advance amount of million at an annual interest rate equal to libor plus a spread 
additionally  the facility includes a million supplemental advance amount that is collateralized by certain of our residual interests in our securitizations 
the facility matures on march  the outstanding balance on the facility was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
it is anticipated that the facility will be renewed on terms no less favorable than the current terms 
additionally  we have four repurchase agreements with citigroup 
three of the repurchase agreements are for the purpose of financing the purchase of investments in three asset backed securities with principal balances of million  million and million respectively 
the fourth repurchase agreement is for the purpose of financing a portion of our residual interest in the b securitization with a principal balance of million 
under the terms of the agreements we sell our interest in the securities with an agreement to repurchase them at a predetermined future date at the principal amount sold plus an interest component 
the securities are financed at an amount equal to of their current market value as determined by citigroup 
typically the repurchase agreements are rolled over for day periods when they expire 
the annual interest rates on the agreements are equal to libor plus a spread 
the repurchase agreements had outstanding principal balances of approximately million  million  million and million  respectively  at both december  and under the terms of our revolving credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank  na we may borrow up to million to fund required principal and interest advances on manufactured housing loans that we service for outside investors 
borrowings under the facility are repaid when we collect monthly payments made by borrowers under such manufactured housing loans 
the bank s prime interest rate is payable on the outstanding balance 
to secure the loan  we have granted jpmorgan chase bank  na a security interest in substantially all our assets excluding securitized assets 
the expiration date of the facility is december  the outstanding balance on the facility was approximately million at both december  and in september  the securities and exchange commission declared effective our shelf registration statement on form s for the proposed offering  from time to time  of up to million of our common stock  preferred stock and debt securities 
in addition to such debt securities  preferred stock and other common stock we may sell under the registration statement  we have registered for sale  shares of our common stock pursuant to a sales agreement that we have entered into with brinson patrick securities corporation 
it is anticipated that these shares of common stock will be sold at the price of our common stock prevailing at the time of sale 

table of contents in addition to borrowings under our credit facilities and issuances of securitized notes  we have fixed contractual obligations under various lease agreements 
our contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of december  in thousands less than total year years years thereafter notes payable citigroup notes payable a securitization notes payable b securitization notes payable a securitization notes payable b securitization notes payable a securitization repurchase agreement notes payable servicing advances operating leases total contractual obligations origen financial llc and origen securitization company  llc  one of our special purpose entity subsidiaries  are borrowers under the short term securitization facility with citigroup 
origen financial llc through a special purpose entity  origen manufactured housing contract trust a  is the issuer of the notes payable under the a securitization 
origen financial llc through a special purpose entity  origen manufactured housing contract trust b  is the issuer of the notes payable under the b securitization

origen financial llc through a special purpose entity  origen manufactured housing contract trust a  is the issuer of the notes payable under the a securitization 
origen financial llc is the borrower under the citigroup repurchase agreement 
origen financial llc is the borrower under the servicing advance facility with jpmorgan chase bank  na we need cash to pay interest expense on our securitized bonds and credit facilities 
we expect the total interest expense to be in excess of million during the twelve months ending december  our long term liquidity and capital requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to originate and hold manufactured housing loans  acquire and hold manufactured housing loans originated by third parties and expand our loan servicing operations 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations  but we will require external sources of capital  which may include sales of shares of our common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  convertible debt securities and third party borrowings either pursuant to our shelf registration statement on form s or otherwise 
we intend to continue to access the asset backed securities market for the long term financing of our loans in order to match the interest rate risk between our loans and the related long term funding source 
our ability to meet our long term liquidity needs depends on numerous factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include general capital market and economic conditions  general market interest rate levels  the shape of the yield curve and spreads between rates on us treasury obligations and securitized bonds  all of which affect investors demand for equity and debt securities  including securitized debt securities 
cash generated from operations  borrowings under our citigroup facility  loan securitizations  borrowings against our securitized loan residuals  convertible debt  equity interests or additional debt financing arrangements either pursuant to our shelf registration statement on form s or otherwise will enable us to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months depending on market conditions which may affect loan origination volume  loan purchase opportunities and the availability of securitizations 
if market conditions require  loan purchase opportunities become available  or favorable capital opportunities become available  we may seek additional funds through additional credit facilities or additional sales of our common or preferred stock 

table of contents the risks associated with the manufactured housing business become more acute in any economic slowdown or recession 
periods of economic slowdown or recession may be accompanied by decreased demand for consumer credit and declining asset values 
in the manufactured housing business  any material decline in collateral values increases the loan to value ratios of loans previously made  thereby weakening collateral coverage and increasing the size of losses in the event of default 
delinquencies  repossessions  foreclosures and losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions 
for our finance customers  loss of employment  increases in cost of living or other adverse economic conditions would impair their ability to meet their payment obligations 
higher industry inventory levels of repossessed manufactured houses may affect recovery rates and result in future impairment charges and provision for losses 
in addition  in an economic slowdown or recession  servicing and litigation costs generally increase 
any sustained period of increased delinquencies  repossessions  foreclosures  losses or increased costs would adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments 
we are not currently subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
the outstanding balance of our variable rate debt  under which we paid interest at various libor rates plus a spread  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
if libor increased or decreased by during the years ended december  and  we believe our interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately million and million  respectively  based on the million and million average balance outstanding under our variable rate debt facilities for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we had no variable rate interest earning assets outstanding during the years ended december  or the following table shows the contractual maturity dates of our assets and liabilities at december  for each maturity category in the table the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities reflects an imbalance between re pricing opportunities for the two sides of the balance sheet 
the consequences of a negative cumulative gap at the end of one year suggests that  if interest rates were to rise  liability costs would increase more quickly than asset yields  placing negative pressure on earnings dollars in thousands

table of contents our hedging strategies use derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swap contracts  to mitigate interest rate risk and variability in cash flows on our securitizations and anticipated securitizations 
it is not our policy to use derivatives to speculate on interest rates 
these derivative instruments are intended to provide income and cash flow to offset potential increased interest expense and potential variability in cash flows under certain interest rate environments 
we held five separate open derivative positions at december  all five of these positions were interest rate swaps 
one of the positions is an interest rate swap related to our a securitization which locks in the interest rate on the outstanding balance of the a variable rate notes at for the life of the notes 
the outstanding notional balance on this interest rate swap was million at december  we held three interest rate swaps for the purpose of locking in the interest rate on a portion of our anticipated a securitization transaction 
the agreements fix the interest rate on notional amounts of million  million and million at  and  respectively 
each of the three swaps has a scheduled termination date of september at december  we held one interest rate swap which was not accounted for as a hedge 
under the agreement  at december   we paid one month libor and received a fixed rate of on an outstanding notional balance of million 
the scheduled termination date of this swap agreement is april the following table shows our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates and are categorized by contractual maturity at december   dollars in thousands contractual maturity there after total interest sensitive assets interest bearing deposits average interest rate investments average interest rate loans receivable  net average interest rate derivative asset average interest rate total interest sensitive assets interest sensitive liabilities warehouse financing average interest rate securitization financing average interest rate repurchase agreements average interest rate notes payable servicing advances average interest rate derivative liability average interest rate total interest sensitive liabilities
