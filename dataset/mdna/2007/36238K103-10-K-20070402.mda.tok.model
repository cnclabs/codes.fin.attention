item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  our audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in the consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future period 
we use the terms gtsi  we  our  and us to refer to gtsi corp 
and its subsidiaries 
overview gtsi has more than years of experience in selling it products and solutions primarily to us federal government customers 
we believe our key differentiators to be our strong brand among government customers  extensive contract portfolio  close relationships with wide variety of vendors  and move to a technology lifecycle management approach 
currently  the vast majority of the it solutions we offer to our customers have a strong product component  and many are entirely product based 
we connect it s leading vendors  products and services inside the core technology areas most critical to government success by partnering with global it leaders such as panasonic  hp  cisco  sun microsystems and microsoft 
in our traditional reseller capacity  we provide government with products for workgroup computing  such as workstations and desktops  mobility computing and communications  such as wireless equipped notebooks and pdas  core computing  such as servers  high end computing  and storage systems  networking products  and a wide range of peripherals 
during  we focused on application areas in which our government customers have consistently demonstrated the greatest immediate strategic interest  and which provide us with the greatest opportunity for sustained return on investment 
we directed our attention to government solutions  including unified communications  network security  mobile evidence capture  storage consolidation  and server consolidation 
to help our customers acquire  manage and refresh this technology in a strategic and application appropriate manner  gtsi has created a mix of professional and financial services capable of managing and funding the entire technology lifecycle 
gtsi has grown the professional services organization to handle the increase in engineering  maintenance  and management services supporting our solutions 
additionally  gtsi offers leasing arrangements to allow government agencies to acquire access to technology as an evenly distributed operating expense  rather than the much more budget sensitive and discontinuous capital expenses 
this model is in high demand from our customers  and we believe it represents a distinctive advantage 
we expect to continue our expansion of sales from leasing arrangements for it products and solutions in as discussed in more detail below our sales decreased approximately million  or  from to  gross margin increased million and gross margin as a percentage of sales increased percentage points from to  in  we recognized a million extinguishment of a liability  in accordance with fas  and changes in estimates related to vendor payable amounts and vendor rebates of million and million  respectively 
these adjustments positively impacted gross margin and net loss by  expenses were impacted by approximately million of non recurring charges related to refinancing our debt included in interest and other income  and severance and restatement fees included in selling  general administrative expenses  our net loss for the year ended december  was million  cash used in operations totaled million for the year ended december   our business experiences significant fluctuations in our quarterly sales  operating loss income and net loss income as a result of the buying patterns of the federal government  our primary customer 
additionally  our results were positively affected by the derecognition of million in aged accrued payables 
we recorded this legal release from these vendor obligations as an offset to cost of sales  which increased our gross margin by million and decreased our loss from operations and net loss by million  or a decrease of per share 
our results were also positively affected by a change in estimate of vendor rebates of million and a change in estimate of vendor payable amounts of million 
as a result of these items  loss from operations and net loss were million or per share lower and gross margin as a percentage of sales increased percentage points for the year ended december  for additional details  see the further md a discussion below  and refer to note of the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
we have put in place a multi element plan to move the business from lower margin product sales to higher margin solutions sales 
in the first element of our plan  we are continually identifying and eliminating certain redundancies within the company and have terminated activities which have failed to yield adequate profitability  including one reduction in workforce totaling over full time positions and realigning functions throughout the company to increase margin improvement through cost reductions 
other elements of our plan  which will progress throughout  include the improved execution of the current business and the delivery of high value solutions 
we believe there are significant opportunities to increase our relatively low market share within the growing government it market as we pursue a distinctive business model combining the concepts of a value added provider of complex it solutions with a traditional reseller 
critical accounting estimates and policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have included below our policies that are both important to our financial condition and operating results  and require management s most subjective and complex judgments in determining the underlying estimates and assumptions 
the following list of critical accounting estimates and policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
accounting policies and estimates that management believes are most important to our financial condition and require management s significant judgments and estimates pertain to revenue recognition  transfer of receivables  valuation of inventory  capitalized internal use software  accounts payable and income taxes 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting estimates and policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the majority of our sales relates to physical products and is generally recognized when title and risk of loss to the products sold passes to the customer 
based on our standard shipping terms  title generally passes upon the customer s receipt of the products 
this requires us to analyze sales near the end of reporting periods to estimate the amount of products in transit to the customer that cannot be recognized as revenue 
many of our sales of physical products are shipped to our customers directly from our vendor partners 
the accurate recording of revenue for these transactions relies upon the accuracy of shipment dates we receive from our vendors and is subject to additional estimates and judgments by management 
when a customer order contains multiple items such as hardware  software  and services that are delivered at varying times  significant judgment is required to determine whether the delivered items can be considered separate units of accounting and if so  how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
we also offer lease and other financing arrangements to customers to acquire technology 
these arrangements typically have terms from two to four years and are generally accounted for as sales type leases under financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for leases  fas 
certain of our service and solution agreements require the evaluation of pattern of performance 
revenues on professional service contracts are generally recognized using the proportional performance basis of accounting 
for some professional services engagements the completed performance method is used when there are customer specified subjective acceptance criteria 
at the time of sale  we record an estimate for product returns based on historical experience 
management reviews the assumptions regarding the lag time and volume of sales returns at least on a quarterly basis  and changes in the estimates are recorded in the period in which they occur 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  we record vendor rebates received under our vendor incentive programs pursuant to a binding arrangement as a reduction of cost of sales based on a systematic and rational allocation that results in progress by the company toward earning the rebate provided the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable 
if the rebate is not probable and reasonably estimable  it is recognized as the milestones are achieved 
in the first quarter of  we determined that rebates under one vendor program were both probable and reasonably estimable and thus began to record rebates under this program as purchases occured during each program period 
accrued vendor rebates recorded at december  related to this vendor positively impacted gross margin by million 
financing receivables we enter into complex agreements with our customers to provide it solutions with payment terms generally spread over a two to four year period 
usually we monetize these future revenue streams by selling such receivables to third party financial institutions 
we have master service agreements with multiple lenders each with varying terms 
these agreements  as well as the individual transaction agreements  require significant analysis to determine whether the transfer of the receivable should be accounted for as a sale or a secured borrowing with pledge of collateral based on financial accounting standards board fasb statement of accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for transfer servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  fas criteria that requires gtsi to effectively surrender control over the asset 
the technical accounting and legal requirements involved are complex and subject to interpretation 
significant judgment is required to determine whether we have effectively surrendered control over the asset 
if certain criteria are met and control is surrendered  the transaction is recorded as a sale and the gain on the sale is recognized in lease related income 
if the transfer does not meet the criteria for a sale  the transaction is reported as a secured borrowing with pledge of collateral 
the collateral remains on our balance sheet and income on the transfer is recognized over the term of the agreement 
differing conclusions in these statements could impact total assets  total liabilities  lease related income  interest expense and earnings loss per share on our consolidated financial statements 
management determined that certain transferred receivables previously accounted for as sales of financial assets did not meet the criteria for a sale and accordingly restated its  and financial statements to reflect the financing receivable and related financed lease debt as assets and liabilities and to recognize the income on certain financing receivables over the life of the related agreement 
following the restatement  income on certain transferred receivables is being recognized over the term of the respective lease agreements  along with interest expense on financed lease debt 
in addition  the transferred receivables together with related liabilities are reported in our balance sheets following the restatement 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted fas no 
revised  share based payment  fas r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payments on estimated fair values 
we adopted this standard using the modified prospective transition method 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
see note under part ii  item of this form k for more information 
during the year ended december   our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of unvested stock options with an exercise price higher than  the market value on the date of the acceleration  previously awarded to employees  officers and directors under gtsi s stock option plans 
this action affected unvested options to purchase an aggregate of thousand shares of common stock at exercise prices per share between and 
the vesting of these options was accelerated to avoid recognizing compensation expense in future financial statements upon the adoption of fas r 
as of december   there was a total of million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock based awards 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
inventory our inventory is stated at the lower of average cost or market value 
we reduce the value of our inventory for excess and obsolete inventory based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess or obsolete inventory 
in the future  if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we would be required to increase our expense to write down inventory to market value and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
capitalized internal use software significant judgment is required to determine what expenditures qualify for capitalization of internal use software 
subsequent additions  modifications or upgrades to internal use software are capitalized only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task that it previously did not perform 
capitalized internal use software is required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair market value 
accounts payable we purchase significant amounts of inventory each year and record an estimate of the payable based on purchases as of the balance sheet date and the historic rate of purchase price variances  which is analyzed and adjusted on a quarterly basis 
for products shipped directly from our vendors to our customers  management makes significant estimates regarding the payable for shipped goods 
as invoices are received  we record adjustments for purchase price variances 
changes in our estimate of the payable balance may be caused by changes in price between the order date and the receipt date related to volume discounts  changes in market rates  or special pricing promotions offered by our vendors 
income taxes determining our effective tax rate  provision for tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the related valuation allowance involves judgments and estimates 
deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the basis reported in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse 
valuation allowances are provided against assets  including net operating losses  if it is anticipated that the asset is not more likely than not to be realized through future taxable earnings or implementation of tax planning strategies 
we record reserves for uncertain tax positions  which management believes are adequate 
we have a valuation allowance against the full amount of our net deferred tax assets  because in the opinion of management  it is not more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
our effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if we determine the allowance is or is not required  or if we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves

sales by vendor panasonic cisco sun microsystems hp microsoft others  net of reserves total hardware software resold third party service products services total year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales sales consist of revenue from products delivered and services sold or rendered  net of customer returns and credits 
sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease in sales is primarily due to weak performance and staff turnover early in associated with certain sales teams  resulting in lower than expected bookings 
this decline was partially offset by an increase in services sales 
an analysis of sales by type indicates the million decrease in hardware sales was the predominant driver of the overall sales decline of million year over year 
decreased hardware sales were partially offset by the million increase in services sales and the million decrease in resold third party product sales year over year 
our services sales increased year over year to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increases in services sales is consistent with our plan to become a high end solutions provider 
we achieved record sales with our us communities contract  which was renewed in april for an additional two years 
as a result  management anticipates our sales to state and local governments will continue to increase as a percentage of our total sales 
although we offer our customers access to products from hundreds of vendors  of our total sales in were products from our top five vendors  and panasonic remains our top vendor in with product sales of million 
although total sales decreased by million in  as compared with  sales from our top five vendors increase by million  which reflects our continued focused vendor strategy

our sixth largest vendor in was network appliances 
sales of network appliances products totaled million  million and million for the years ended  and  respectively 
gross margin gross margin increased million during as compared to the prior year and gross margin as a percentage of sales increased percentage points to for during the year ended december   gross margin was positively impacted by the extinguishment of a vendor liability for million  in accordance with fas  as well as a change in estimate related to vendor rebates of million 
gross margin for the year ended december  included a million charge for excess and obsolete inventory 
gross margin was also positively impacted in and by million and million  respectively  for a change in estimate of amounts payable to vendors 
as a result of these items  gross margin for the years ended december  and was million higher and million lower  respectively 
gross margin was further positively impacted by product mix  with increases to higher margin professional services revenue  focused vendor strategies and centralized pricing initiatives implemented by management 
gross margin was negatively impacted by a decline in vendor incentive funds of million  which is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales 
vendor incentive funds decreased due to decreased sales period over period and changes in vendor incentive fund programs 
selling  general administrative expenses sg a sg a expenses for decreased million  or as compared to the prior year 
sg a expenses as a percentage of sales increased to for from in the prior year 
sg a decreases resulted from reductions in workforce  as a result of our initative to exit failing or non strategic activities  and included over full time positions 
reductions in workforce resulted in a million decrease in net salary expense in  including a million decrease in gross salary expense and a million increase in salaries allocated to billable labor 
reductions in workforce also resulted in a million decrease in training expense 
decreases in sg a expenses were partially offset by additional costs associated with the restatement of our financial statements for prior periods and severance costs 
as a result of restatement efforts  the following expenses increased during  as compared with accounting fees increased by million  consultants expense increased million  and legal fees increased million 
during  sg a expenses included a million severance expense under the transition agreement with our former ceo and million severance expense from other senior management 
other increased costs included incentive compensation expense  which increased million in as compared with  which was primarily related to the accrual for bonuses to our executive officers and other eligible employees in an effort to promote retention and performance in and beyond 
sg a expenses increased million for stock based compensation for our stock options upon the adoption of fas r 
interest and other income  net interest and other income for increased million  or  over the prior year 
interest and other income increased as a result of the sale of a specific lease and related receivables creating a gain of approximately million  as well as an increase in lease related income from increased lease activity in the current year 
in addition  equity income from unconsolidated investments increased by million in as compared with the prior year  due to net income growth from eyak technology  llc  an equity investment 
these increases were offset by increased interest expense  due to increased fees  higher borrowings  and a higher interest rate under our credit facility 
income taxes our income tax benefit decreased from million in to million in the tax benefit recorded during resulted from the release of a tax contingency reserve that is no longer probable due to the expiration of the statute of limitations 
we have provided a valuation allowance against the full amount of the net deferred tax assets due to our loss before income taxes of million at december  the tax benefit recorded during was due to gtsi s loss before income taxes of million for and consists of our tax refund as a result of carrying back our pre tax loss to the amounts paid in and  a release in the contingency reserve that was no longer probable and a true up of items 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales sales decreased million  or  from billion in to million in the decrease in sales is due primarily to the difficulties with the gems implementation during second quarter of and a decrease in gtsi s share of government spending overall 
during the second quarter of  due to the implementation problems with gems  there were customer orders that could not be received into gems and our ability to ship products was also negatively affected 
as a result of the problems with sales bookings  we experienced high turnover on sales teams 
this caused reduced productivity throughout the third and fourth quarters  compounded by a workforce realignment in the fourth quarter that further reduced sales team personnel 
an analysis of sales by type reveals year over year decreases for all types except services  most predominantly the million decline in hardware sales to million in approximately of our sales in were products from our top five vendors 
as detailed in the preceding table  panasonic was our top vendor with product sales of million in network appliance sales more than doubled from to million to become one of our top five vendors for the first time in our sixth largest vendor during and was microsoft 
sales of microsoft products totaled million  million  and million during the years ended  and  respectively 
an increasing percentage of our total sales is derived from products from our top five vendors  reflecting our focused vendor strategy implemented during gross margin gross margin decreased million  or  from million in gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased slightly from in to in in  a million charge for excess and obsolete inventory negatively impacted gross margin 
in addition  gross margin was positively affected in and by million and million  respectively  for the change in estimate of amounts payable to vendors 
in  a million non cash extinguishment of aged vendor liabilities positively impacted gross margin 
gross margin excluding these adjustments was in and in selling  general administrative expenses selling  general administrative sg a expenses for increased million  or from this increase was predominantly related to compensation and benefits expense for new employees as average headcount increased by employees 
in addition  on a per employee basis  average salaries increased approximately year over year 
given the weak sales and margin performance during  and the strains on the organization associated with the gems implementations  we implemented two separate reductions in our workforce  one in october and one in february sg a expenses increased percentage points as a percentage of sales from to these increases were partially offset by a million decline in sales commissions corresponding to our decreased sales 
impairment charge during we decided to use a web based customer resource management crm software instead of the crm module of gems 
as a result  we tested certain asset groupings within gems for recoverability and recorded an impairment loss of approximately million  net of accumulated amortization  in operating expenses to write down gems to its fair value as required by fas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  fas 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net decreased million  or  from to this decrease was mainly due to increased interest expense from secured borrowings 
in addition  interest expense increased from our credit facility borrowings due to higher interest rates and increased borrowings as a result of working capital management issues 
income taxes we recorded a tax benefit of million at an effective tax rate of for as compared to a tax provision of million at an effective rate of for the decrease in our effective tax rate from to was due to a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets that we recorded during the fourth quarter of  and due to our loss before income taxes of million 
as a result  our income tax benefit for consisted of our tax refund as a result of carrying back our pre tax loss to the amounts paid in and  a release in the contingency reserve that was no longer probable and a true up of items 
seasonal fluctuations we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience significant seasonal fluctuations in our operations as a result of the us federal government buying and funding patterns 
the unpredictability of the factors affecting such seasonality makes our annual and quarterly financial results difficult to predict and subject to significant fluctuation 
while sales to the us federal government are usually weaker in the first and second quarter and stronger in the third and fourth quarter  our sg a expenses are more level throughout the year 
as such  first and second quarter earnings are typically well below those of the third and fourth quarters 
our stock price could be adversely affected if any such financial results fail to meet the financial community s expectations 
the following tables show our results of operations on a quarterly basis 
we believe that this information includes all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such quarterly information when read in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
this information has been included to provide additional insight into the seasonal nature of our business

during  we experience decreased working capital needs  compared to  as a result of reduced losses and lower vendor payables at the end of cash provided by financing activities of million during was due principally to proceeds from financed lease debt of million and proceeds from long term debt of million  which were offset by net repayments of million under our revolving credit facility 
the volume of leasing transactions increased between and  however the proceeds from the transfer of receivables to third party financial institutions decreased million in credit facility and term loan during  we obtained a million credit agreement with a group of lenders the credit facility 
this credit facility replaced gtsi s former credit facility which expired on may  the credit facility provides access to capital through june  with borrowings secured by substantially all of the assets of the company 
borrowing under the credit facility at any time is limited to the lesser of million or a collateral based borrowing base less outstanding obligations 
the credit facility subjects gtsi to certain covenants limiting its ability to i incur debt  ii make guarantees  iii make restricted payments  purchases or investments  iv enter into certain transactions with affiliates  v acquire real estate and vii enter into sale and leaseback transactions 
the credit facility carries an interest rate generally indexed to the prime rate plus plus margin

the debt covenants and maturity date on the term loan are the same as the credit facility

this agreement contains a prepayment penalty which is equal to the greater of i all interest payable for the first twelve months of the agreement  less interest paid through current or ii of the amount prepaid 
capital resources and requirements our ongoing capital requirements depend on a variety of factors  including the extent to which we are able to fund the cash needs of our business from operations 
during  we experienced continued working capital shortages as a result of our continued execution of our strategy to exit certain types of lower margin businesses and increased bank fees related to our new credit agreement  and relied upon our vendor credit and borrowings under our credit facility to fund our operations 
we anticipate that we will continue to rely upon these sources to finance our operating cash needs during the majority of we believe that such funds should be sufficient to satisfy our near term anticipated cash requirements for operations 
our ongoing capital requirements depend on a variety of factors  including the extent to which we are able to fund the cash needs of our business from operations 
we anticipate that we will continue to rely primarily on operating cash flow  vendor credit and our credit facility to finance our operating cash needs 
we believe that such funds should be sufficient to satisfy our near term anticipated cash requirements for operations 
the credit agreement imposes financial and reporting covenants on the company  including the meeting of a minimum ebitda level during each quarterly period 
during  the company signed two amendments to the credit agreement to change the reporting requirements and the minimum ebitda covenants 
the company was in compliance with all financial covenants as set forth in the credit agreement as of december  on march   the company and its lenders executed an amendment to this credit agreement  which removed the minimum ebitda covenant at march  and revised the minimum ebitda covenant for future measurement periods 
while the company believes that we will remain in compliance with all of the financial and reporting covenants under the credit agreement  including the minimum ebitda covenant based on the recent amendment  there can be no assurance that we will do so 
a breach of any of the covenants or restrictions in the credit agreement could result in an event of default under the credit agreement 
such a default could result in the lenders discontinuing lending or declaring all outstanding borrowings to be due and payable 
if any of these events occur  we would need to find additional or alternative financing  if available  to refinance any such accelerated obligations 
there can be no assurance that such financing would be available 
financed lease debt decreased from million at december  to million at december   bearing weighted average interest rates of and  respectively 
these secured borrowings will be funded from the financing receivables of million and million as of december  and  respectively

this agreement was terminated on february  when the company entered into a transition agreement with its former ceo the transition agreement 
the transition agreement provides for a payment of million to be paid out over the next months  as well as reimbursement for certain benefits and legal fees

new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized 
the minimum threshold is defined in fin as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is estimated to be greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin must be applied to all existing tax positions upon initial adoption 
the cumulative effect of applying fin at adoption  if any  is to be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings shareholder s deficit for the year of adoption 
fin is effective for the company on january  we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of fin will have on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued fas no 
 fair value measurement  fas  which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fas is effective for interim periods beginning after november  we are in the process of evaluating the adoption of fas item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk gtsi had a million credit facility indexed at the prime rate plus plus margin as of december  gtsi also had a term loan of million indexed at prime plus as of december  the credit facility and term loan expose us to market risk from changes in interest rates 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have 
our results of operations are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on borrowings under our credit facility and term loan 
if interest rates increase  our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same  which would require more cash to service our indebtedness 
as of december   the effect of a increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional interest expense during of million based on our average monthly balances 
we have not used derivative instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our borrowings 
as of december  we had million of variable rate debt subject to interest 
included in our long term debt are amounts related to lease transactions 
we have reported these amounts in note as long term financed lease debt 
these amounts will amortize over the period of the lease instruments with no cash affect to the company 
the balances of these liabilities were million and million at december  and  respectively 
a change in interest rates would result in no additional interest expense related to financed lease debt
