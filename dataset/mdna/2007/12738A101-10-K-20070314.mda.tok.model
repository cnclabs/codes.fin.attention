the balance of the allowance for loan losses reflects management s best estimate of probable loan losses related to specifically identified loans  as well as probable incurred loan losses in the remaining portfolio 
reference should be made to note a in the notes to consolidated financial statements and to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the following schedule sets forth the components of the allowance for loan losses at december  and this allocation is based upon the consistent  quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses

graded loans are those loans that exhibit some form of weakness 
allocations to this group are based upon the historical loan loss experience of the grades assigned and upon specific allocations to specific loans 
an allowance is allocated to the various pools of loans considered to be homogenous based upon the historical loan losses of each pool 
other loans consist of those loans not graded or impaired or considered homogenous 
these loans are grouped by risk assignments  which are based upon consideration of collateral values  borrower financial condition and performance  debt service capacity  cash flows  market share and other indicators 
allocations of the allowance to these loans are based upon historical loan loss experience of the risk assignment 
c 
loans and risk descriptions real estate loans the bank originates loans secured by commercial real estate  one to four family residential properties  and multi family dwelling units or more units 
at december   these loans totaled million or approximately of the loan portfolio 
the bank originates commercial real estate loans of up to of the appraised value 
currently  it is the corporation s policy to originate these loans only to carefully selected borrowers and on properties in the market area 
of primary concern in commercial real estate lending are the borrower s credit worthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project 
to monitor cash flows of borrowers  annual financial statements are obtained from the borrower and loan guarantors  if any 
although many banks have had significant losses in commercial real estate lending  cadence has historically sustained few losses  and those losses were not significant relative to the size of the entire commercial real estate loan portfolio at the time 
the bank originates loans secured by first and junior liens on one to four family residences in its lending areas 
typically  such loans are single family homes that serve as the primary residence of the borrower 
generally  these loans are originated in amounts up to of the appraised value or selling price of the property 
see note d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these loans 
loans for multi family or more units residential properties are generally secured by apartment buildings 
loans secured by income generating properties are generally larger and involve greater risk than residential loans because payments are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties 
as a result  these types of loans may be more sensitive to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
cash flow and financial statements are obtained from the borrowers and any guarantors 
also  rent rolls are often obtained 
consumer and other loans cadence offers consumer loans in the form of home improvement loans  mobile home loans  automobile loans and unsecured personal loans 
these loans totaled million  or of total loans  at december  consumer loans are originated in order to provide a wide range of financial services to customers and because the terms and normally higher interest rates on such loans help maintain a profitable spread between the average loan yield and the cost of funds 

table of contents in connection with consumer loan applications  the borrower s income statement and credit bureau report are reviewed 
in addition  the relationship of the loan to the value of the collateral is considered 
all automobile loan applications are reviewed  as well as the value of the collateral securing the loan 
cadence intends to continue to emphasize the origination of consumer loans 
management believes that its loan loss experience in connection with its consumer loan portfolio is favorable in comparison to industry averages 
the bank makes commercial business loans on both a secured and unsecured basis with terms generally not exceeding five years 
non real estate commercial loans primarily consist of short term loans for working capital purposes  inventories  seasonal loans  lines of credit and equipment loans 
a personal guaranty of payment by the principals of any borrowing entity is often required and the financial statements and income tax returns of the entity and its guarantors are reviewed

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition an d results of operations the following provides a narrative discussion and analysis of significant changes in our results of operations and financial condition 
you should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  and the supplemental financial data included elsewhere in this report  including the five year summary of selected financial data and management s letter to shareholders at the beginning of our annual report to shareholders that accompanies the proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders 
introduction and management overview cadence financial corporation  formerly nbc capital corporation  is a financial holding company that owns cadence bank  na cadence or the bank  which operates in mississippi  alabama  tennessee  florida and georgia 
we provide full financial services  including banking  trust services  mortgage services  insurance and investment products 
our stock is traded on the nasdaq global select market nasdaq under the ticker symbol of cade 
for purposes of the following discussion  the words the corporation  we  us and our refer to the combined entities of cadence financial corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary  cadence  unless the context suggests otherwise 
we accomplished a number of strategic objectives in first  at the annual shareholders meeting held in june  our shareholders voted to change our corporate name to cadence financial corporation 
the change aligns our corporate name with that of the bank and further leverages the brand recognition being created in our markets 
the new cadence brand is part of an overall marketing and business strategy that we expect to create marketing efficiencies by having one uniform marketing effort and brand 
our strategic growth plan for included opening new branches in some of our higher growth markets  adding a de novo bank in another high growth market  and evaluating potential acquisition candidates to increase our share in existing markets and to expand our footprint into new markets 
during  we opened a cadence de 
table of contents novo branch in brentwood  tennessee nashville msa  as well as two new branches in the memphis market 
we also began planning the construction of a full service branch in hoover  alabama birmingham msa 
on august   we completed our acquisition of suncoast bancorp  inc suncoast  the holding company for suncoast bank  a commercial bank operating in sarasota and manatee counties  florida 
additionally  on november   we completed our acquisition of seasons bancshares  inc seasons  the holding company for seasons bank  a commercial bank headquartered in blairsville  georgia 
see note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details relating to the seasons and suncoast acquisitions 
these acquisitions will allow us to expand further into the rapidly growing markets of tampa  sarasota and naples  florida and the north atlanta area of georgia 
finally  we issued additional equity in to support our growth objectives 
on may   we closed on a secondary public offering of our common stock  where we sold million shares at a price of per share  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
we used a portion of these proceeds to fund the suncoast and seasons acquisitions and will use the remainder for other general corporate purposes 
during  five major factors significantly impacted our operating results  as follows the million share stock offering and the issuance of  shares in the suncoast acquisition significantly impacted our earnings per share for our average primary shares outstanding increased from  in to  in second  the federal reserve continued to raise short term interest rates for the first half of the increase in rates impacted our net interest income  as yields on earning assets and cost of funds increased 
third  the overall economy in the mississippi market remained somewhat flat  however  the tennessee and alabama markets provided good loan growth for the year million growth in tennessee and million growth in alabama 
the increased loan growth positively impacted our net interest income for fourth  the acquisitions of suncoast and seasons directly impacted our net interest income by increasing our average earning assets 
the acquisitions also increased our other expenses  primarily due to salaries and occupancy costs 
lastly  the overall credit quality of the bank s loan portfolio improved during  which allowed us to reduce the provision for loan losses during the year below the levels that were budgeted 
for  our net interest margin was  compared to for increasing interest rates during the first half of improved the yields on loans  as the loan portfolio  which is composed of approximately variable rate loans and fixed rate loans  repriced upward 
to a lesser extent  the improved rate environment also had a positive impact on the return on our investment portfolio  as the yields on the investment portfolio increased by basis points over however  our overall cost of funds increased by a greater percentage during  as the rising rate environment in the first half of the year and our need to fund the loan growth put pressure on deposit and other borrowing rates 
we maintained our underwriting standards during  and therefore  as of december   management regarded the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio as good  evidenced by the lower provision for loan losses during the year  which is discussed more fully below 
during  noninterest income  including gains on securities and impairment loss on securities  increased slightly  from million to million 
the growth of noninterest income has been and continues to be one of our major strategic goals 
the components and reasons for the increase in this category are discussed more fully below 
noninterest income accounted for of income in and of income in this change was impacted more by the growth in total interest income in approximately  than by the slight increase in noninterest income 
another goal of management in was to continue to control the level of noninterest expenses 
during  total noninterest expenses increased by million  or 
approximately million of this increase is due to expenses relating to the de novo branches in hoover and brentwood  the new branches in memphis  and the former suncoast and seasons branches 
during  we reported net income of million  or per fully diluted share  compared to million  or per fully diluted share  for in  management s focus will turn from the external growth objectives of  which included both de novo locations and acquisitions  to effectively and efficiently managing the footprint that has been established 
we will continue to focus on growth  however  during  we expect it to come from organic growth in our existing footprint 

table of contents we are continuing our efforts to grow loans and improve our margin 
with potential improvement in the mississippi market  the continued strong growth in tennessee and alabama and the addition of the florida and georgia markets  management believes that we will be able to achieve solid loan growth in the expansion or even maintenance of the margin  however  will be a more difficult objective to attain in the current interest rate environment 
the inverted yield curve  an environment in which short term rates are higher than long term rates  presents a significant obstacle 
additionally  our need for funding has increased as our loan demand has increased  requiring us to pay higher rates to grow deposits 
currently  management expects  based on available information  that interest rates will be flat to slightly down in we expect strong growth to continue in the memphis and tuscaloosa markets and anticipate that our recent entries into the birmingham and nashville msas and florida will continue to provide us with additional strong growth markets 
we based our projections  budgets and goals on these expectations 
if these trends move differently than expected in either direction or speed  they could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the areas of our operations most directly impacted would be the net interest margin  loan and deposit growth and the provision for loan losses 
we continue to look for ways to grow noninterest income 
the continued growth in the memphis market  the expansion into the birmingham and nashville msas and the acquisitions of suncoast and seasons should provide new customer bases for our other banking products and services 
in the areas of noninterest income  our primary objective for is to expand our mortgage origination efforts into our new markets in alabama  tennessee  florida and georgia 
this process began in late  with the reorganization of our mortgage division to take advantage of these opportunities 
we also continue our efforts to control noninterest expenses 
in the area of noninterest expenses  our efforts will be focused on controlling these expense categories as we continue our efforts to achieve maximum efficiencies within our new expanded footprint 
reducing our efficiency ratio remains a key objective 
our primary objective for is to grow net income 
the previously mentioned growth in assets  expansion of noninterest income  and control of noninterest expenses will all contribute to this net income growth 
other areas of focus to accomplish this goal will be controlling the cost of funding that will be needed to both support our current asset levels and our expected growth and maintaining our level of credit quality 
funding is a challenging issue  due to the inverted yield curve 
this situation makes it very difficult to obtain the desired spread between loan yields and cost of funds 
also  there is increased competition for core deposits as all banks struggle to maintain this very important component of their funding 
if the economy slows or the real estate market continues to soften  credit quality will become an issue 
currently our credit quality is good  and we will continue our policy of not lowering our credit underwriting standards to obtain loan growth 
even though we believe that we will have net income growth in  it will not translate into growth in earnings per share 
the reason for this is that in  we will have the full effect of the shares issued in the additional equity offering and for the suncoast acquisition for an entire year 
the average outstanding shares for were  in  we estimate that average outstanding shares will be at least  an increase of  or 
in summary  our primary objectives in are to increase net income  improve our net interest margin  expand our mortgage activities into our new markets  gain efficiencies in our operations as we continue to assimilate the new markets  maintain our credit quality  and finalize our plans for additional branch expansion to begin in recently issued accounting standards and critical accounting policies our accounting and financial reporting policies conform to united states generally accepted accounting principles and to general practices within the banking industry 
note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our accounting policies 
management is of the opinion that note a  read in conjunction with all other information in our annual report  including management s letter to shareholders and this management s discussion and analysis  is sufficient to provide the reader with the information needed to understand our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies it is management s opinion that the areas of the financial statements that require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  and therefore contain the most critical accounting estimates  are the provision for loan losses and the resulting allowance for loan losses  the liability and expense relating to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans  issues relating to other than temporary impairment losses in the securities portfolio  and goodwill and other intangible assets 

table of contents provision allowance for loan losses our provision for loan losses is utilized to replenish the allowance for loan losses on the balance sheet 
the allowance is maintained at a level deemed adequate by management and the board of directors after their evaluation of the risk exposure contained in our loan portfolio 
the senior credit officers and the loan review staff perform the methodology used to make this determination of risk exposure on a quarterly basis 
as a part of this evaluation  certain loans are individually reviewed to determine if there is an impairment of our ability to collect the loans and the related interest 
this determination is generally made based on collateral value 
if the senior credit officers and loan review staff determine that impairments exist  specific portions of the allowance are allocated to these individual loans 
we group all other loans into homogeneous pools and determine risk exposure by considering the following list of factors this list is not all inclusive and the factors reviewed may change as circumstances change historical loss experiences  trends in delinquencies and non accruals  and national  regional and local economic conditions 
these economic conditions would include  but not be limited to  general real estate conditions  the current interest rate environment and trends  unemployment levels and other information  as deemed appropriate 
additionally  management looks at specific external credit risk factors that bring additional risk into the portfolio 
for the period ended december   we identified the following five external risk factors stagnant to negative employment reports for the northeast mississippi area  the current higher rate environment resulting in higher borrowing costs and lower debt service coverages  increased risk associated with commercial real estate credits  slowdown trend in the real estate market  and lack of familiarity with the north georgia market 
these external risk factors will be re evaluated on a quarterly basis 
management makes its estimates of the credit risk in the portfolio and the amount of provision needed to keep the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level using what management believes are the best and most current sources of information available at the time of the estimates  however  many of these factors can change quickly and with no advance warning 
if management significantly misses its estimates in any period  it can have a material impact on the results of operations for that period and for subsequent periods 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans another area that requires subjective and complex judgments is the liability and expense relating to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
we maintain several benefit plans for our employees 
they include a defined benefit pension plan  a defined contribution pension plan  a k plan and a deferred compensation plan 
we make all contributions to these plans when due 
the defined benefit pension plan is the only plan that requires multiple assumptions to determine the liability under the plan 
this plan has been frozen to new participants for several years 
management evaluates  reviews with the plan actuaries  and updates as appropriate the assumptions used in the determination of pension liability  including the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  and increases in future compensation 
actual experience that differs from the assumptions could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
the discount rate and the expected rate of return on the plan assets have a significant impact on the actuarially computed present value of future benefits that is recorded on the financial statements as a liability and the corresponding pension expense 
in selecting the expected rate of return  management  in consultation with the plan trustees  selected a rate based on assumptions compared to recent returns and economic forecasts 
we consider the current allocation of the portfolio and the probable rates of return of each investment type 
in selecting the discount rate  prior to  management  in consultation with actuarial consultants  selected rates based on rates of return on long term  high quality bonds having maturity dates corresponding as closely as possible to the expected retirement dates of the employees and the subsequent payout periods of the respective plans 
beginning in  management  with the assistance of actuarial consultants  selects the appropriate discount rate by performing an analysis of the plan s projected benefit cash flows against discount rates from a national pension discount curve a yield curve used to measure pension liabilities 
to reflect the appropriate rate  based on this analysis  management reduced the discount rate from in to in and we used an expected rate of return of for  and from a historical perspective  the rates of return on the plan were for  for and for additionally  our philosophy has been to fund the plan annually to the maximum amount deductible under the internal revenue service rules 
as a result  as of december   the plan has a prepaid benefit cost of million 
at december   we had a current accumulated benefit obligation of approximately million and plan assets with a fair value of approximately million 
fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  requires us to recognize the funded status of the plan defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation on the balance sheet and to recognize in other comprehensive income any gains or losses and prior service costs or benefits not included as components of periodic benefit cost 
detailed information on our pension plan and the related impacts of these changes on the amounts recorded in our financial statements can be found in note m of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents other than temporary impairment of investment securities a third area that requires subjective and complex judgments on the part of management is the review of the investments in the securities portfolio for other than temporary impairments 
eitf issue and fasb fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  require us to review our investment portfolio and determine if it has impairment losses that are other than temporary 
in making its determination  management considers the following items the length of time and extent to which the current market value is less than cost  evidence of a forecasted recovery  financial condition and the industry environment of the issuer  downgrades of the securities by rating agencies  whether there has been a reduction or elimination of dividends or interest payments  whether we have the intent or ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery of fair value  and interest rate trends that may impact recovery and realization 
during the third quarter of  we recognized a million other than temporary impairment charge relating to certain fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock 
as of december   our securities portfolio included a significant number of securities that were impaired  by definition 
we reviewed each of these securities to determine if any of the impairments were other than temporary 
using the criteria listed above  management made the determination that as of december   none of the impairments were other than temporary 
goodwill and other intangible assets fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  eliminated the requirement to amortize goodwill  however  it does require periodic testing for impairment 
we completed our impairment test in accordance with statement no 
in october and concluded that no impairment writedown was warranted 
at december   we had approximately million of goodwill on our balance sheet  which will remain at that level unless it becomes impaired under the definition of impairment in statement no 
other accounting regulatory issues in the normal course of business  our wholly owned subsidiary bank  cadence  makes loans to related parties  including our directors and executive officers and their relatives and affiliates 
we make these loans on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other parties 
also  the loans are consistent with sound banking practices and within applicable regulatory and lending limitations 
please see note o in the notes to consolidated financial statements and our proxy statement for additional details concerning related party transactions 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of generally prohibits loans to executive officers 
however  the rule does not apply to any loan made or maintained by an insured depository institution if the loan is subject to the insider lending restrictions of section h of the federal reserve act 
all loans that the bank makes to executive officers are subject to the above referenced section of the federal reserve act 
we own nbc capital corporation ms statutory trust i and enterprise tn statutory trust i  both organized under the laws of the state of connecticut for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities

results of operations net income for was million  or per diluted share  an increase from million  or per diluted share  in and million  or per diluted share  in return on average equity was in  in  and in return on average assets was in and in and net interest income nii  the primary source of our earnings  represents income generated from earning assets  less the interest expense of funding those assets 
nii increased by in and in changes in nii may be divided into two components  first  the change in average earning assets volume component and second  the change in the net interest spread rate component 
net interest spread represents the difference between yields on earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities

during this period  the net interest margin declined to  compared to for net interest margin is net interest income divided by average earning assets 

table of contents in analyzing the rate component of nii  from to  we gained basis points of yield on our earning assets 
however  during this period  the cost of funds increased by basis points

from to  the yield on loans increased from to 
the increase in interest rates also had a positive impact on other earning assets  as the yield on federal funds sold increased from to and the yield on the investment securities portfolio increased from to 
the increase in rates had a negative impact on our cost of funds  as our cost of deposits increased from to and our cost of other borrowings increased from to 
also  the increase in rates resulted in an inverted yield curve 
as a result  we were not able to increase our loan yields as much as the cost of deposits increased 
the increase in average earning assets from to is composed of the following average loans increased by million  average federal funds sold and other interest bearing assets increased by million  and average investment securities increased by million

based on an evaluation of the risk exposure contained in the loan portfolio  management and the board of directors believe that the level of the allowance is adequate 
this is an ongoing process  and we review and determine the amount of the provision quarterly  using a methodology that over the years has proven to be sound 
the provision for loan losses decreased from  in to  in and to  in the decrease in the provisions for and resulted from an overall improvement in the credit quality in the portfolio 
the details of these improvements are shown in the following section  entitled financial condition  under the discussion of the allowance for loan losses 
management expects significant loan growth in as our newer markets in brentwood  hoover  sarasota  and memphis continue to expand 
considering this expected growth and unknown external factors  management intends to increase the provision for loan losses in at this time  management expects the level of the provision to protect us from any unforeseen deterioration in the quality of the loan portfolio 
however  if during the year  any or all of these factors change in direction or speed  we will make the necessary adjustments in the provision to reflect these changes 
noninterest income includes various service charges  fees and commissions we collected  including insurance commissions earned by galloway chandler mckinney insurance agency  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of cadence 
it has been  and continues to be  one of our strategic focuses to diversify our other income sources so that we can be less dependent on net interest income 
other income increased slightly from million in to million in the changes in the major categories between and are as follows in thousands change service charges on deposit accounts insurance commissions  fees  and premiums other service charges and fees trust department income mortgage loan fees securities gains losses  net bank owned life insurance income impairment loss on securities other total other income 
table of contents service charges on deposit accounts increased by in  mostly due to improved management and oversight of our noninterest bearing accounts 
other service charges and fees increased by  primarily due to increases in official check income  checkcard income  and retail investment income 
other noninterest income increased by in this increase is mostly due to a  gain on the sale of our credit card portfolio  a  increase in earnings from our investment in a low income housing partnership  and  in gains on the early extinguishment of approximately million of federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings assumed in the acquisition of enterprise 
also  includes a  gain related to our interest in the pulse card clearing network  which was sold during the first quarter 
changes in other accounts were not individually material 
we recognized  in securities gains during  compared with gains of  in in addition  during the third quarter of  we recognized a million other than temporary impairment charge relating to certain fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock 
those securities were sold in the fourth quarter of for amounts approximating their fair values 
other income declined slightly from million in to million in the changes in the major categories between and are as follows in thousands change service charges on deposit accounts insurance commissions  fees  and premiums other service charges and fees trust department income mortgage loan fees securities gains losses  net bank owned life insurance income other total other income the  decline in other income resulted mainly from a  or  decline in service charges on deposit accounts  a  or  decline in mortgage loan fees  and a  or  decline in bank owned life insurance income 
the decrease in service charges on deposit accounts largely resulted from an increase in the number of free checking accounts and an overall reduction in the amount of non sufficient funds nsf fees that were generated from our noninterest bearing deposit accounts 
mortgage fee income continued its decline during we experienced continued strong demand for new home loans  however  that demand was not enough to offset a decline in the demand to refinance existing mortgage loans 
bank owned life insurance income declined as the insurance companies continued to lower their crediting rates as the yields on their general account portfolios continued to decline as older  higher yield assets matured and were replaced by securities with lower yields 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in other categories of noninterest income 
income from fiduciary activities increased by  or  insurance commissions and fee income increased by  or  other noninterest income increased by  or  and other service charges and fees increased by  or 
the increase in income from fiduciary activities resulted from the amount of assets under management and the overall improvement in the equity markets over the past year 
the increase in insurance commissions and fee income resulted from an improvement in both sales volume and the level of profit sharing received from the insurance carriers based on loss experience 
the increase in other service charges and fees and other noninterest income was due to a one time gain of  related to our interest in the pulse card clearing network  which was sold during the first quarter of  an increase of  in checkcard income and a  settlement from the state of mississippi on a road construction project affecting a branch bank 
the increase in checkcard income resulted from increased usage  as more transactions were processed electronically 
this gain was partially offset by a  decline in income from retail investments and a decline of  in gain on sale of repossessed assets 
all other changes in the other accounts were not material in amount 
we recognized  in securities gains during  compared to gains of  during 
table of contents noninterest expense represents ordinary overhead expenses 
these expenses increased from million in to million in the following table shows the detailed changes in the major categories of noninterest expense between and in thousands change salaries employee benefits net occupancy furniture and equipment communications data processing advertising professional fees intangible amortization other total other expense noninterest expense increased by in  primarily due to the following a million  or  increase in salaries  a million  or increase in employee benefits  a  or  increase in net occupancy expense  a  or  increase in furniture and equipment expense  and a  or  increase in advertising expense 
the increase in salaries and the increase in employee benefits can be attributed to three primary factors salaries and employee benefits related to the new de novo branches in hoover  alabama and brentwood  tennessee  additional salaries and employee benefits related to the former suncoast and seasons branches  and pension costs associated with certain scheduled retirements 
salaries and employee benefits expense for the de novo branches totaled  for  salaries and employee benefits related to the former suncoast and seasons branches totaled  for  and pension expense increased by  as a result of the scheduled retirements 
exclusive of these items  our overall salaries and employee benefits expense increased by approximately  due mostly to normal raises and the addition of certain key staff positions 
the increase in net occupancy expense and the increase in furniture and equipment expense are mostly due to increased depreciation  facility rental  and equipment rental expenses associated with the de novo branches  the new branches opened in memphis and the former suncoast and seasons branches 
these added branches accounted for  of the  increase in expense from to the increase in advertising expense is due to our market expansions in  as well as additional system wide campaigns run during the year that included the promotion of the new cadence bank name 
none of the changes in the other expense categories were considered to be individually material 
noninterest expenses increased from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
the following table shows the detailed changes in the category 
expenses from enterprise are included for nine months in and all of  however  enterprise was merged into cadence in november as a result  separate numbers for enterprise for are not available 
in thousands change salaries employee benefits net occupancy furniture and equipment communications data processing advertising professional fees intangible amortization other total other expense salaries increased  or  from to our executive and senior management bonus program is based upon our reaching predetermined profit goals for the year 
we reached these goals for as a result  we accrued approximately  for anticipated bonuses 
without this bonus accrual  this expense category would have increased 
table of contents only by  or 
the predetermined profit goals were not reached in  therefore  no significant bonuses were accrued in that year 
during  employee benefits increased by  or 
approximately of this increase came from the accrued payroll taxes and k contribution matches related to the bonuses and year end incentives 
net occupancy expense increased  or 
this increase came primarily from three sources 
first  included a full year of enterprise expense while included only nine months 
this accounted for approximately of the increase 
second  was the first full year of the data center expansion depreciation 
third  we incurred rental increases on some of the properties in memphis and rental expenses associated with the opening of the hoover  alabama de novo branch in october data processing expenses increased by  or 
virtually all of these increased expenses were associated with the conversion of our core operating system from an ibm environment to a sun micro systems environment 
professional fees decreased by  or 
this expense reduction came from the elimination of one time direct expense to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
other noninterest expenses increased by  or 
this increase resulted primarily from expenses associated with the merger of enterprise and cadence  as well as expenses related to the bank s name change 
also during  we incurred approximately  in losses as a result of enterprise repurchasing loans sold in in  other noninterest expenses included approximately  in expenses associated with the closing of four under performing branches in the mississippi market 
none of the changes in the other expense categories were individually considered to be material 
changes in our income tax expense have generally paralleled changes in pre tax income 
our effective tax rates were in  in  and in these changes in both years resulted primarily from the mix of income from tax exempt investments and the percentage relationship of tax exempt income to total pre tax income 
the alternative minimum tax provision  the market supply of acceptable municipal securities  the level of tax exempt yields and our normal liquidity and balance sheet structure requirements limit our ability to reduce income tax expense by acquiring additional tax free investments 
in summary  net income increased from million  or per diluted share  in  to million  or per diluted share  in  and to million  or per diluted share  in the reduction in earnings per share in was caused by the additional shares issued with the stock offering in may and the shares issued in the acquisition of suncoast in august 
if fully diluted earnings per share had been computed using the same number of shares used in the computation  they would have been per diluted share 
additionally  the fully diluted earnings per share for were impacted by the one time impairment charge of   after taxes  or cents per share 
the impact of this charge was partially offset by the gain on early extinguishment of debt of  and the gain on the sale of our credit card loan portfolio of  these two items equated to   after taxes  or eight cents per share 
in  fully diluted earnings per share were reduced by approximately nine cents per share because of the cost associated with the bank s name change and the merger of cadence and enterprise 
this was partially offset by approximately six cents per share from the gain on the sale of the pulse card clearing network and the settlement with the state of mississippi on the impact of a road construction project affecting a branch bank 
these items netted to a three cent per share reduction in financial condition during  our balance sheet showed an increase in total assets from billion at december   to billion at december  this was an increase of approximately million  or 
during the year  cash and cash equivalents increased from million to million  an increase of million  or 
this increase is due to several factors  including the million structured repurchase transaction we initiated in december  which is reflected in federal funds sold at year end 
in addition  we invested a portion of the proceeds from our stock offering in an interest bearing account at the fhlb 
during  the investment securities portfolio increased slightly from million to million  an increase of million  or 
the loan portfolio grew from million at the end of to billion at december  the increase during the year was million  or 
of this increase  million came from our new markets in florida and georgia 
our de novo branch in brentwood  tennessee nashville msa opened in february contributed million of the increase  and our de novo branch in hoover  alabama birmingham msa opened in october contributed million of the increase 
the remaining growth came from our memphis  tennessee and tuscaloosa  alabama markets 
our mississippi market continues to produce little loan growth 

table of contents during  the allowance for loan losses increased by million  or  from million to million 
the suncoast and seasons acquisitions added million to our allowance for loan losses 
even though there has been increased competition for good quality credits in our markets  we did not reduce our underwriting standards  and as a result  the quality of the portfolio remains strong 
see note d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the transactions in the allowance for loan losses for the three year period ended december  the following table reflects some of the statistics we use to evaluate the quality and potential exposure within our loan portfolio year ended year ended net charge offs as a percentage of average net loans outstanding non performing loans as a percentage of total loans classified assets as a percentage of average capital allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans based on the evaluations described earlier and the information above  the allowances for loan losses at the end of and were deemed adequate to cover exposure in our loan portfolio 
the methodology used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses was tested during  as loans were charged off  and no additional special provision was needed 
all of these loans had previously been identified and properly reserved against 
the liability side of the balance sheet increased from billion at december  to billion at december   an increase of million  or 
during  deposits increased by million  or  to billion 
the increase resulted from a million  or  increase in interest bearing deposits  and a million  or  increase in non interest bearing deposits 
the acquisition of suncoast contributed million to this increase  and the acquisition of seasons contributed million 
of the remaining million growth in deposits  approximately million came from our core mississippi markets 
these markets provide a lower cost of deposits than our metro markets 
the remaining growth was spread over our remaining markets  with tuscaloosa contributing million and memphis contributing million 
during the year  we actively sought to increase deposits  in order to fund increases in loan demand 
federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased by million  or  from million to million 
also during  fhlb advances increased by million  or 
this growth in wholesale funding also resulted from the strong loan growth in and our need to fund this growth 
our objective is to fund loan growth with the proper mix of retail and wholesale funding that will maximize net interest income and yet maintain our core deposits at the appropriate level 
as loan demand increases with the continued growth of our memphis  nashville  tuscaloosa and birmingham markets and the establishment of the cadence brand in our new florida and georgia markets and in keeping with our funding objectives  we will aggressively seek deposits and will continue to look to the wholesale market for appropriate additions to funding 
capital resources and shareholders equity shareholders equity increased from million at the end of to million at the end of in may  we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
our treasury stock shares were reissued as part of this offering 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the offering to fund the suncoast and seasons acquisitions and intend to use the remainder of the proceeds for other general corporate purposes 
in august  we completed our acquisition of suncoast 
the acquisition was valued at approximately million  of which was paid in cash and was paid in shares of our common stock 
we issued approximately  shares in connection with the suncoast acquisition 
in november  we completed our acquisition of seasons 
the acquisition was an all cash transaction valued at approximately million 
during  we generated net income of million  from which we declared approximately million in dividends 
also during the year  accumulated other comprehensive income improved from an unrealized loss of million 
table of contents to an unrealized loss of million 
included in the change in accumulated other comprehensive income are a million increase in the market value of the available for sale portion of our investment securities portfolio which includes a million other than temporary impairment charge recognized on certain fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock  a million adjustment to our pension liability  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 and a  unrealized loss on interest rate swaps during the capital to asset ratio increased from at december  to at december  peer organizations are traditionally in the to range 
current regulatory requirements call for a basic leverage ratio of for an institution to be considered well capitalized 
at the end of  we maintained a leverage ratio  significantly exceeding the ratio required for a well capitalized institution 
regulatory authorities also evaluate a financial institution s capital under certain risk weighted formulas high risk assets would require a higher capital allotment  lower risk assets a lower capital allotment 
in this context  a well capitalized financial institution is required to have a tier risk based capital ratio excludes allowance for loan losses of and a total risk based capital ratio includes allowance for loan losses of 
at the end of  we had a tier risk based capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
liquidity  inflation and asset liability management liquidity may be defined as our ability to meet cash flow requirements created by decreases in deposits and or other sources of funds or increases in loan demand 
we have not experienced any problems with liquidity during and anticipate that all liquidity requirements will be met in the future 
our traditional sources of funds from deposit growth  maturing loans and investments and earnings have generally allowed us to consistently generate sufficient funds to meet our daily operational liquidity needs 
as the result of a million increase in loans and a million increase in deposits  our loan deposit ratio increased from in to in our total funding sources include not only deposits  but also federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and fhlb borrowings 
when we include these sources of funding with deposits  our loans to total funding ratio increased in from to 
management s target loans to deposits ratio is in the range of  and our goal is to limit wholesale funding to no more than of total assets 
in may  we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the offering to fund the suncoast and seasons acquisitions and intend to use the remainder of the proceeds for other general corporate purposes 
we offer retail repurchase agreements to accommodate excess funds of some of our larger depositors 
management believes that these repurchase agreements stabilize traditional deposit sources as opposed to risking the potential loss of these funds to alternative investment arrangements 
retail repurchase agreements  which we view as a source of funds  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the level of retail repurchase agreement activity is limited by the availability of investment portfolio securities to be pledged against the accounts and our asset liability funding policy 
because of the limited amount of retail repurchase agreements and the fact that the underlying securities remain under our control  we do not consider the exposure for this service material 
in december  we entered into a million structured repurchase transaction 
this transaction was a standard repurchase transaction with a fixed rate of and a three year term 
the transaction has a quarterly call option after one year 
we believe that normal earnings and other traditional sources of cash flow  along with additional fhlb borrowings  if necessary  will provide the cash to allow us to meet our obligations with no adverse effect on liquidity 
at december   we had the ability to borrow approximately million from the fhlb under the blanket line and had other unused short term borrowing lines federal funds purchased lines of approximately million from upstream correspondent banks 
as of december   we had million in outstanding fhlb borrowings 
in december  we entered into a secured line of credit with an upstream correspondent that provides us access to borrow up to million 
these borrowings may be used to finance acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes  provided that the borrowings used for purposes other than acquisitions do not exceed million 
the term of the line of credit is two years 
interest on each borrowing will be paid at the lender s base rate or at libor  plus annually 
we also pay a commitment fee  accruing at the annual rate of  on the daily amount of the unused commitment 
borrowings are contingent on our ability to maintain various operational and financial covenants 
we have pledged  shares of our stock as collateral for these borrowings and have covenanted to pledge shares with a minimum book value of million 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit 

table of contents we have no plans for the refinancing or redemption of any liabilities other than normal maturities and payments relating to the fhlb borrowings 
we do not have plans at this time for any discretionary spending that would have a material impact on liquidity 
our stock repurchase plan gives management the authority  at its discretion  to purchase  additional shares of our common stock 
if purchased at the year end closing price of  this purchase would require approximately million 
any purchases under this program will be made over an unknown period of time  and the necessary funds will be provided from internal sources 
under regulations controlling financial holding companies and national banks  the bank is limited in the amount it can lend to our holding company  and such loans are required to be on a fully secured basis 
at december   there were no loans between the bank and the holding company 
the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature  therefore  a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies  which have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
fluctuations in interest rate and actions of the federal reserve board to regulate the national money supply in order to mitigate recessionary and inflationary pressures have a greater effect on a financial institution s profitability than do the higher costs for goods and services 
we believe the most significant impact of inflation on financial results is our ability to react to changes in interest rates 
we maintained a consistent and disciplined asset liability management policy during focusing on interest rate risk and sensitivity 
the primary objective of rate sensitivity management is to maintain net interest income growth while reducing exposure to adverse fluctuations in rates 
we utilize an asset liability management committee to evaluate and analyze our pricing  asset liability maturities and growth  and balance sheet mix strategies in an effort to make informed decisions that will increase income and limit interest rate risk 
the committee uses simulation modeling as a guide for decision making and to forecast changes in net income and the economic value of equity under assumed fluctuations in interest rate levels 
due to the potential volatility of interest rates  our goal is to stabilize the net interest margin by maintaining a neutral rate sensitive position 
at year end  our balance sheet reflected approximately million less in rate sensitive assets than liabilities that were scheduled to reprice within one year 
this represents of total assets and would indicate that we are slightly liability sensitive 
this computation results from a static gap analysis that weights assets and liabilities equally 
management believes that interest rates will be flat to slightly down during and that our current position places us in the correct interest rate risk posture for this rate environment 
management does not believe that it is in our best interest to speculate on changes in interest rate levels 
although earnings could be enhanced if predictions were correct  they could also be put at significant risk if interest rates move against predictions 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations during  we hedged a portion of our floating rate prime based lending portfolio using floating to fixed interest rate swaps 
as of december   we had five outstanding swaps with a total notional amount of million 
original maturities on these swaps range from twelve to twenty four months  and rates range from to 
these transactions were initiated to protect us from future downward fluctuations in the prime rate and to help ensure a more consistent cash flow from interest earned by our prime based lending portfolio 
these transactions are cash flow hedges as defined by fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and were accounted for in accordance with the provisions of that statement 
as required by statement no 
 we measured the effectiveness of these transactions as of december  and determined that they remained highly effective  as defined by the statement 
in september  we entered into a million structured repurchase transaction in the secondary market 
this term repurchase transaction has a embedded floor and a three year term 
it was priced at three month libor plus basis points and reprices every three months 
this transaction is in line with our asset liability strategy and was entered into to help protect us against an unexpected downturn in short term interest rates 
this derivative instrument was accounted for as an embedded derivative under fasb statement no

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the corporation is exposed only to us dollar interest rate changes and  accordingly  we manage exposure by considering the possible changes in the net interest margin 
we do not have any trading instruments nor do we classify any portion of the investment portfolio as held for trading 
in  we entered into five floating to fixed interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of its floating rate prime based lending portfolio 
the transactions are cash flow hedges as defined by statement no 
and are accounted for under the provisions of the statement 
these transactions are in line with our asset liability strategy and were entered into to help protect the corporation against an unexpected downturn in short term interest rates 
as we continue to enhance our asset liability management  we will continue to look for opportunities to protect the corporation from unexpected changes in interest rates 
finally  we have no exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  and other market risks 
the following table reflects the year end position of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which can either reprice or mature within the designated time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gaps can vary from day to day and 
table of contents are not necessarily a reflection of the future 
in addition  certain assets and liabilities within the same designated time period may nonetheless reprice at different times and at different levels 
in thousands december  interest sensitive within cumulative three months twelve months five years total interest earning assets loans investment and mortgage backed securities federal funds sold and other interest bearing liabilities deposits borrowed funds sensitivity gap dollar amount percent of total interest earning assets the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing within a specific time frame exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing within that same time frame 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
in a rising interest rate environment  an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in the yield of its assets relative to the costs of its liabilities and thus an increase in the institution s net interest income would result 
at december   total interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year were less than interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same time period by approximately million cumulative  representing a negative cumulative one year gap of of earning assets 
management believes this position to be acceptable in the current interest rate environment 
banking regulators have issued advisories concerning the management of interest rate risk irr 
the regulators consider effective interest rate management an essential component of safe and sound banking practices 
to monitor our irr  our risk management practices include a risk management  b risk monitoring and c risk control 
risk management consists of a system in which a measurement is taken of the amount of earnings at risk when interest rates change 
we first prepare a base strategy  which is the position of the bank and its forecasted earnings based upon the current interest rate environment or most likely interest rate environment 
the irr is then measured based upon hypothetical changes in interest rates by measuring the impact such a change will have on the base strategy 
risk monitoring consists of evaluating the base strategy and the assumptions used in its development based upon the current interest rate environment 
this evaluation is performed quarterly by management or more often in a rapidly changing interest rate situation and monitored by an asset liability management committee 
interest rate risk is managed based upon our tolerance for interest rate exposure and the resulting effect on net interest income and the economic value of equity 
a balance sheet and income statement simulation model is prepared monthly  using current month end data 
a base case simulation is prepared monthly using current month growth trends  projected forward and a flat rate forecast 
two additional interest rate shock simulations are prepared  one showing rates rising basis points and one showing a basis point decline in rates 
our policy is that a basis point shock in rates should not cause the projection of net interest income to change by more than and cause the economic value of equity to change by more that than and 
the december model reflects net interest income under this scenario increasing by with a basis point upward shock of rates and decreasing if rates are shocked down basis points 
at december   a basis point immediate increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decline in market 
table of contents value of equity  and a basis point instant decrease would have resulted in a decrease in market value of equity 
at december   we are within policy on both of these tests  and management believed that changes in net interest income and market value of equity  as reflected in our models  were acceptable
