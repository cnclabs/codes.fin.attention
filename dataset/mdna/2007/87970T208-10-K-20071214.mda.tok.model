item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction telular corporation telular or the company designs  develops  and distributes products and services that utilize wireless phone networks to provide data and voice connectivity among people and machines 
telular s product and service offerings take advantage of the pervasiveness and data transport capabilities of wireless phone networks in order to replace functionality historically provided by wireline communications networks 
bridging the gap between traditional  wireline equipment and wireless phone networks  the company s products and services replace the wireline network while providing the added flexibility and security of wireless connectivity 
the company generates most of its revenue by designing  producing and selling products and through the delivery of event monitoring services which can be included with certain of the company s terminal products 
it recognizes revenue when its products ship from various manufacturing locations to customers and when services are performed 
although the company has a broad base of customers worldwide  much of its revenue is generated from a small number of major customers and via large contracts  the timing of which is often unpredictable 
the company s operating expense levels are based in large part on expectations of future revenues 
if anticipated sales in any quarter do not occur as expected  expenditure and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and the company s operating results for that quarter  and potentially for future quarters  could be adversely affected 
certain factors that could significantly impact expected results are described in cautionary statements that are set forth in exhibit to this document 
the fixed cellular terminal fct market is primarily in north and south america and consists of a number of vertical applications ranging from wireless residential and commercial alarm systems addressed by telguard to internet access provided by phonecell fcts 
the fct market is addressed primarily through indirect channels consisting of distributors  representatives and agents along with in house sales and customer support teams 
a direct sales model is utilized for certain large customers 
during  telular discontinued its fixed cellular phone fcp segment and the business unit is currently being marketed for sale 
the fcp market is prevalent in countries outside of north america with low fixed line penetration 
cellular carriers offering services in this market are price driven as they target residential and small business markets where equipment subsidies are often used to reach the requisite end user price points 
due to the intense price competition in this business  the company determined that it could no longer profitably compete in this market  hence  the segment was discontinued as of july it is expected that the sale of the fcp business unit will take place no later than june   and the company will operate it until that point in time with the goal of extracting as much working capital from the fcp business as possible

management expects trade accounts receivable and inventory to turn into cash in short periods of time 
as such  given the level of cash and cash equivalents  trade accounts receivable  inventory and available borrowings  management believes the company has adequate resources to fund current and planned operations 
the company generated million of cash from operating activities during fiscal year compared to using million of cash during fiscal year the cash generated from operating activities is primarily the result of million from net income from continuing operations  million of non cash expenses  a million increase in trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities  primarily due to the timing of purchases from vendors  a million increase in trade accounts receivable due to increased sales volume  a million increase in inventories to support the increased sales volume and a million decrease in prepaid and other assets

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to net realizable value of inventories and intangible assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations reserve for obsolescence significant management judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
the company currently considers inventory quantities greater than a one year supply based on current year activity as well as any additional specifically identified inventory to be excess 
the company also provides for the total value of inventories that are determined to be obsolete based on criteria such as customer demand and changing technologies 
at september  and  the inventory reserves were million and million  respectively 
changes in strategic direction  such as discontinuance or expansion of product lines  changes in technology or changes in market conditions  could result in significant changes in required reserves 
goodwill the company evaluates the fair value and recoverability of the goodwill see note to the consolidated financial statements whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable or at least annually 
in determining fair value and recoverability  the company makes projections regarding future cash flows 
these projections are based on assumptions and estimates of growth rates for the related business segment  anticipated future economic conditions  the assignment of discount rates relative to risk associated with companies in similar industries and estimates of terminal values 
an impairment loss is assessed and recognized in operating earnings when the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
currently  the company has significant deferred tax assets principally related to net operating losses 
deferred tax assets are reviewed regularly for recoverability and when necessary  valuation allowances are established based on historical tax losses  projected future taxable income  and expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences 
valuation allowances have been provided for all deferred tax assets  due to the uncertainty about the realizability of such deferred tax assets 
future profitable operations and changes in the company s expectations could result in significant adjustments to the valuation allowances  which would significantly impact the company s net income 
recently issued accounting pronouncements the discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements is hereby incorporated by reference from item  notes to consolidated financial statements 
outlook the statements contained in this outlook are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
the company expects to continue to capitalize on its favorable market position in the domestic security alarm market and it expects to grow telguard subscribers substantially 
due to uncertainties in international markets and pending new product introductions  the company is unable to forecast results for other fct products 
the amount and frequency of product shipments to the company s largest customers depends on many factors  including market conditions and agreements with other suppliers 
the outcome of pending and future negotiations for orders with such customers and the timing of shipments may have a significant impact on the company s future revenues and profitability 
forward looking information this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the company also includes certain estimates  projections and other forward looking statements in its reports and in other publicly available material 
statements regarding expectations  including performance assumptions and estimates relating to capital requirements  as well as other statements that are not historical facts  are forwarding looking statements 
these statements reflect management s judgments based on currently available information and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company frequently invests available cash and cash equivalents in short term instruments such as certificates of deposit  commercial paper and money market accounts 
although the rate of interest paid on such investments may fluctuate over time  each of the company s investments is made at a fixed interest rate over the duration of the investment 
all of these investments have maturities of less than days 
the company believes its exposure to market risk fluctuations for these investments is not material as of september  financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade accounts receivable 
to reduce its exposure to the credit risks of international customers  the company generally seeks payment prior to shipment  receives irrevocable letters of credit that are confirmed by us banks  or purchases commercial credit insurance 
in some instances  the company extends credit to foreign customers without the protection of prepayment  letters of credit or credit insurance 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations and charges amounts to operations when they are determined to be uncollectible 
we have significant sales to cantv  the venezuelan  government owned telecom company and have a material amount of trade accounts receivable at this time 
while we have always received amounts owed from all of our venezuelan customers  it is difficult to predict if this will continue due to volatile political conditions in venezuela at this time 
because of the steps taken above to mitigate credit risks of international customers  the company believes that its exposure to credit risk is not material with the exception of the unpredictable conditions in venezuela 
to mitigate the effects of currency fluctuations on the company s results of operations  the company conducts all of its international transactions in us dollars
