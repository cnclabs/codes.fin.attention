item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following is a discussion of our financial condition at december  and and our results of operations comparing the years ended december  and and the years ended december  and you should read this section together with the consolidated financial statements including the notes to those financial statements for the years mentioned above 
we are a leading provider of international seaborne crude oil transportation services with a large mid sized vessel fleet 
as of december  our fleet consisted of vessels aframax and eight suezmax vessels with a total cargo carrying capacity of million deadweight tons 
in addition  we have three suezmax vessels  one of which was delivered in january  and two of which are newbuildings scheduled to be delivered during and early comprising an additional million deadweight tons in the aggregate 
spot and time charter deployment we actively manage the deployment of our fleet between spot market voyage charters  which generally last from several days to several weeks  and time charters  which can last up to several years 
a spot market voyage charter is generally a contract to carry a specific cargo from a load port to a discharge port for an agreed upon total amount 
under spot market voyage charters  we pay voyage expenses such as port  canal and fuel costs 
a time charter is generally a contract to charter a vessel for a fixed period of time at a set daily rate 
under time charters  the charterer pays voyage expenses such as port  canal and fuel costs 
vessels operating on time charters provide more predictable cash flows  but can yield lower profit margins than vessels operating in the spot market during periods characterized by favorable market conditions 
vessels operating in the spot market generate revenues that are less predictable but may enable us to capture increased profit margins during periods of improvements in tanker rates although we are exposed to the risk of declining tanker rates 
we are constantly evaluating opportunities to increase the number of our vessels deployed on time charters  but only expect to enter into additional time charters if we can obtain contract terms that satisfy our criteria 
net voyage revenues as performance measure for discussion and analysis purposes only  we evaluate performance using net voyage revenues 
net voyage revenues are voyage revenues minus voyage expenses 
voyage expenses primarily consist of port  canal and fuel costs that are unique to a particular voyage  which would otherwise be paid by a charterer under a time charter 
we believe that presenting voyage revenues  net of voyage expenses  neutralizes the variability created by unique costs associated with particular voyages or the deployment of vessels on time charter or on the spot market and presents a more accurate representation of the revenues generated by our vessels 
our voyage revenues are recognized ratably over the duration of the voyages and the lives of the charters  while direct vessel expenses are recognized when incurred 
we recognize the revenues of time charters that contain rate escalation schedules at the average rate during the life of the contract 
we calculate time charter equivalent  or tce  rates by dividing net voyage revenue by voyage days for the relevant time period 
we also generate demurrage revenue  which represents fees charged to charterers associated with our spot market voyages when the charterer exceeds the agreed upon time required to load or discharge a cargo 
we calculate daily direct vessel operating expenses and daily general and administrative expenses for the relevant period by dividing the total expenses by the aggregate number of calendar days that we owned each vessel for the period 
results of operations margin analysis for the indicated items as a percentage of net voyage revenues for the years ended december   and are set forth in the table below 
income statement margin analysis of net voyage revenues year ended december  income statement data net voyage revenues direct vessel expenses other expense general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization gain on sale of vessels operating income net interest expense other income expense net income net voyage revenues are voyage revenues minus voyage expenses 
voyage expenses primarily consist of port  canal and fuel costs that are unique to a particular voyage  which would otherwise be paid by a charterer under a time charter 
income statement data dollars in thousands  except share data year ended december  voyage revenues voyage expenses net voyage revenues year ended december  compared to the year ended december  voyage revenues voyage revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the number of vessel operating days to  days in from  days in the prior year  which is primarily attributable to a decrease in the size of our fleet 
the average size of our fleet decreased to aframax  suezmax vessels during the year ended december  compared to vessels aframax  suezmax during the prior year 
this decrease is partially offset by stronger spot and time charter rates during as compared to the prior year 
this overall decrease is consistent with our strategy to selectively sell older vessels when and if appropriate opportunities are identified in order to adjust our fleet characteristics and profile to suit customer preferences and to monetize investments in vessels to generate capital for potential future growth 
however  there can be no assurance that we will grow our fleet in voyage revenues are expected to decrease during due to our smaller fleet size as well as the higher number of time charter days we expect to have in as compared to spot charters typically result in higher voyage revenues because the charter rates must be sufficient to recover voyage expenses that the charterer pays for under a time charter 
voyage expenses voyage expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
substantially all of our voyage expenses relate to spot charter voyages  under which the vessel owner is responsible for voyage expenses such as fuel and port costs 
this decrease in voyage expenses is primarily due to a decrease in the number of days our vessels operated under spot charters 
during the year ended december   the number of days our vessels operated under spot charters decreased by  or  to  days  days aframax   days suezmax from  days  days aframax   days suezmax during the prior year 
this decrease was partially offset by fuel costs which were higher per spot vessel day during the year ended december  compared to the prior year period 
fuel cost decreased by million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to million during the prior year 
port costs  which can vary depending on the geographic regions in which the vessels operate and their trading patterns  decreased by million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to million during the prior year 
included in these port costs are suez canal transit costs of approximately million during the year ended december  compared to million during the prior year 
voyage expenses are expected to decrease during due to our smaller fleet size as well as the higher number of time charter days we expect to have in as compared to net voyage revenues net voyage revenues  which are voyage revenues minus voyage expenses  decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
of this total decrease  approximately million is attributable to the decrease in the average size of our fleet which decreased to vessels aframax  suezmax for the year ended december  compared to vessels aframax  suezmax for the prior year 
this decrease is partially offset by approximately million of additional net voyage revenue associated with stronger daily rates for time charters and spot charters for suezmax and aframax vessels during the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
our average tce rates increased to  during the year ended december  compared to  during the year ended december  the following is additional data pertaining to net voyage revenues year ended december  increase decrease change net voyage revenue in thousands time charter aframax suezmax total spot charter aframax suezmax total total net voyage revenue vessel operating days time charter aframax suezmax total spot charter aframax suezmax total total vessel operating days average number of vessels time charter equivalent tce time charter aframax suezmax combined spot charter aframax suezmax combined total tce as of december   ten of our vessels are on time charters expiring between august and december direct vessel expenses direct vessel expenses  which include crew costs  provisions  deck and engine stores  lubricating oil  insurance  maintenance and repairs decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the size of our fleet during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
this decrease is partially offset by higher daily direct vessel expenses per vessel which increased by  or  to   aframax   suezmax for the year ended december  compared to   aframax   suezmax for the prior year 
this increase in daily direct vessel expenses is primarily attributed to higher crew costs associated with enhanced crew training  changes in crew complements and repatriating crews of vessels that we sold during  higher costs of lubricating oils and higher insurance costs 
we anticpate that direct vessel expenses will remain flat during as compared to due to the slight decrease in the average size of our fleet during as compared to and higher expected daily direct vessel expenses 
we expect daily direct vessel operating expenses to increase during due to higher crew  lubricating oils and insurance costs 
other expense other expense for the year ended december  is comprised of a million settlement of a claim by a subsidiary of the exxon mobil corporation arising from the february  collision of the genmar kestrel 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
the primary components of this increase for the year ended december  compared to the prior year are a a million increase in compensation to our us based personnel  principally consisting of a million non cash increase in restricted stock amortization  which included higher amortization in as compared to of restricted stock grants made in april  december  may  october and december  and a million increase in salaries and bonuses during as compared to b a million increase in as compared to relating to operating our foreign subsidiary in portugal  which increase is primarily attributable to greater headcount in associated with the transfer to portugal of the technical management of vessels that our office in greece had handled through may  c a million decrease in as compared to relating to our decision to close our foreign subsidiary in greece  which ceased technical management of vessels in may and is currently being wound down 
d a million decrease in as compared to relating to professional fees incurred during such as strategic advisory services associated with an unsolicited acquisition proposal and senior executive employment agreements that did not recur in as well as lower costs in as compared to relating to sarbanes oxley compliance  and e a million decrease in as compared to relating to our lease of an aircraft 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net voyage revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year 
daily general and administrative expenses per vessel increased  or  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses during will decrease principally attributable to million of expenses associated with costs incurred relating to our office in greece which will not recur in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization  which include depreciation of vessels as well as amortization of drydocking  special survey and loan fees  decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease is primarily due to the reduction in the size of our fleet during  which decreased vessel depreciation by million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to million during the prior year 
amortization of drydocking decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease is primarily attributable to the reduction in the size of our fleet during gain on sale of vessels during  we agreed to sell vessels comprised of a our four single hull suezmax vessels  b our six double sided suezmax vessels  c our one single hull aframax vessel and d our six double sided aframax vessels in order to transform our fleet to exclusively double hull vessels 
through december   of these vessels were delivered to their new owners for aggregate net proceeds of million  for a net gain on sale of vessels of million 
during  we sold the four remaining vessels described above as well as our nine aframax obo vessels  which we decided to sell to reduce the average age of our fleet 
these vessels were delivered to their new owners for aggregate net proceeds of million  for a net gain on sale of vessels of million 
interest income interest income increased by million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to million during the prior year 
this increase is the result of higher average cash balances and higher interest rates on deposits earned during compared to interest expense interest expense decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
million of this decrease resulted from a decrease in interest expense relating to our senior notes  substantially all of which we retired in december an additional million decrease pertains to lower interest expense on our revolving credit facilities due to lower average borrowing levels during as compared to  partially offset by higher floating borrowing rates during compared to during the year ended december   our weighted average indebtedness on our credit facilities decreased by to million from million during the prior year 
because we intend to fund substantially the entire amount of our per share dividend with new borrowings under our credit facility  we expect that interest expense will increase significantly during other income expense during  other income expense consisted primarily of a million loss relating to our repurchase of million of our senior notes  which includes a million write off of deferred financing costs 
also  in october  we entered into an million credit facility  refinancing our million credit facility  at which time we wrote off as a non cash charge million associated with the unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the million credit facility 
net income net income was million for the year ended december  compared to net income of million for the prior year 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  voyage revenues voyage revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease is due to the lower spot market for suezmax and aframax vessels during the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
also contributing to this decrease is a decrease in the number of vessel operating days during to  days in from  days in the prior year period  attributable to a decrease in the size of our fleet and a heavier drydocking schedule as compared to the prior year 
the average size of our fleet decreased to aframax  suezmax vessels during the year ended december  compared to vessels aframax  suezmax during the prior year 
this decrease is consistent with our strategy to selectively sell older vessels when and if appropriate opportunities are identified in order to adjust our fleet characteristics and profile to suit customer preferences and to monetize investments in vessels to generate capital for potential future growth 
voyage expenses voyage expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
substantially all of our voyage expenses relate to spot charter voyages  under which the vessel owner is responsible for voyage expenses such as fuel and port costs 
million of this increase is attributable to higher fuel costs during the year ended december  compared to the prior year period 
in addition  during the year ended december   we incurred million more costs than in the prior year relating to transit through the suez canal 
this increase in voyage expenses occurred in spite of a decrease in the number of days our vessels operated under spot charters 
during the year ended december   the number of days our vessels operated under spot charters decreased by  or  to  days  days aframax   days suezmax from  days  days aframax   days suezmax during the prior year 
net voyage revenues net voyage revenues  which are voyage revenues minus voyage expenses  decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
approximately million of this decrease is due to the weaker spot market for suezmax and aframax vessels during the year ended december  compared to the prior year as well as a decrease in the average size of our fleet 
our average tce rates declined to  during the year ended december  compared to  during the year ended december  the average size of our fleet decreased to vessels aframax  suezmax for the year ended december  compared to vessels aframax  suezmax for the prior year 
the following is additional data pertaining to net voyage revenues year ended december  increase decrease change net voyage revenue in thousands time charter aframax suezmax total spot charter aframax suezmax total total net voyage revenue vessel operating days time charter aframax suezmax total spot charter aframax suezmax total total vessel operating days average number of vessels time charter equivalent tce time charter aframax suezmax combined spot charter aframax suezmax combined total tce as of december   of our vessels including our nine obo aframax vessels which were sold in were on time charters that expired between march and july direct vessel expenses direct vessel expenses  which include crew costs  provisions  deck and engine stores  lubricating oil  insurance  maintenance and repairs decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease is due to a decrease in crewing costs associated with lower crew travel costs during the year ended december  compared to the prior year as well as a decrease in the size of our fleet 
on a daily basis  direct vessel expenses per vessel decreased by  or  to   aframax   suezmax for the year ended december  compared to   aframax   suezmax for the prior year  primarily as the result of a decrease in crewing costs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
the primary components of this increase for the year ended december  compared to the prior year are a a million increase in restricted stock amortization  salaries and bonus accruals for our us based personnel  which included amortization of restricted stock grants made in february  april  may and december  b a million increase in professional fees attributable to consultation  legal and accounting costs associated with strategic advisory services associated with an unsolicited acquisition proposal  senior executive employment agreements and sarbanes oxley compliance  c a million increase in the costs of operating our foreign subsidiaries in greece and the united kingdom  which reflects increases in number of personnel  d million increase in lease payments and expenses associated with our lease of an aircraft which the company entered into during february  and e million increase in occupancy costs attributable to rent paid on both our former new york city office which we occupied until april and our new corporate headquarters for which our lease began in december general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net voyage revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year 
daily general and administrative expenses per vessel increased  or  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization  which include depreciation of vessels as well as amortization of drydocking  special survey and loan fees  decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease is primarily due to the reduction in the size of our fleet during  which decreased vessel depreciation by million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to million during the prior year  partially offset by increases in drydock amortization 
amortization of drydocking increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
this increase includes amortization associated with million of capitalized expenditures relating to our vessels for the year ended december  as well as a full year of amortization associated with million of capitalized drydocking for the prior year 
gain on sale of vessels during  we agreed to sell our four single hull suezmax vessels  our six double sided suezmax vessels  our one single hull aframax vessel and our six double sided aframax vessels in order to transform our fleet to exclusively double hull vessels 
through december   of these vessels were delivered to their new owners for aggregate net proceeds of million  for a net gain on sale of vessels of million 
during july  we agreed to sell four of our single hull suezmax vessels in order to reduce the number of single hull vessels in the company s fleet 
these vessels were sold during august and october for aggregate net proceeds of approximately million  resulting in a gain on sale of vessels of million 
in addition  as of december   we reclassified our nine aframax obo vessels from vessels to vessels held for sale 
we decided to sell these vessels to reduce the average age of our fleet 
net interest expense net interest expense decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in our weighted average outstanding debt of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to decreases in our floating rate debt which bears lower interest rates than our senior notes 
the effect of the retirement of substantially all of our senior notes as of december   did not have a significant effect on interest expense because this retirement occurred on december  other income expense during  other income expense consisted primarily of a million loss relating to our repurchase of million of our senior notes  which includes a million write off of deferred financing costs 
also  in october  we entered into an million credit facility  refinancing our million credit facility  at which time we wrote off as a non cash charge million associated with the unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the million credit facility 
on july   we entered into an million credit facility  refinancing our first  second and third credit facilities 
upon consummation of this refinancing  unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the first  second and third credit facilities aggregating million was written off as a non cash charge in july net income net income was million for the year ended december  compared to net income of million for the prior year 
effects of inflation the company does not consider inflation to be a significant risk to the cost of doing business in the current or foreseeable future 
inflation has a moderate impact on operating expenses  drydocking expenses and corporate overhead 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of funds  cash management since our formation  our principal sources of funds have been equity financings  issuance of long term debt securities  operating cash flows  long term bank borrowings and opportunistic sales of our older vessels 
our principal use of funds has been capital expenditures to establish and grow our fleet  maintain the quality of our vessels  comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations  fund working capital requirements and repayments on outstanding loan facilities 
beginning in  we also adopted policies to use funds to pay dividends and  from time to time  to repurchase our common stock 
see below for descriptions of our dividend policy and our share repurchase program 
our practice has been to acquire vessels using a combination of funds received from equity investors  bank debt secured by mortgages on our vessels and shares of the common stock of our shipowning subsidiaries  and long term debt securities 
because our payment of dividends is expected to decrease our available cash  while we expect to use our operating cash flows and borrowings to fund acquisitions  if any  on a short term basis  we also intend to review debt and equity financing alternatives to fund such acquisitions 
our business is capital intensive and its future success will depend on our ability to maintain a high quality fleet through the acquisition of newer vessels and the selective sale of older vessels 
these acquisitions will be principally subject to management s expectation of future market conditions as well as our ability to acquire vessels on favorable terms 
we expect to rely on operating cash flows as well as long term borrowings and future equity offerings to implement our growth plan  dividend policy  and share repurchase 
we believe that our current cash balance as well as operating cash flows and available borrowings under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next year 
our operation of ocean going vessels carries an inherent risk of catastrophic marine disasters and property losses caused by adverse severe weather conditions  mechanical failures  human error  war  terrorism and other circumstances or events 
in addition  the transportation of crude oil is subject to business interruptions due to political circumstances  hostilities among nations  labor strikes and boycotts 
our current insurance coverage includes protection and indemnity insurance coverage for tort liability  which is provided by mutual protection and indemnity associations  hull and machinery insurance for actual or constructive loss from collision  fire  grounding and engine breakdown  war risk insurance for confiscation  seizure  capture  vandalism  sabotage and other war related risks and loss of hire insurance for loss of revenue for up to days resulting from a vessel being off hire for all of our vessels 
dividend policy on january  we announced that our board of directors initiated a cash dividend policy 
under the policy  we declared quarterly dividends to shareholders in april  july  october and february of each year based on our ebitda after net interest expense and reserves  as established by the board of directors 
these reserves took into account normal maintenance and drydocking of existing vessels as well as capital expenditures for vessel acquisitions to ensure the indefinite renewal of our fleet 
on june   we paid million of dividends to our shareholders relating to the quarter ended march  on september   we paid million of dividends to our shareholders relating to the quarter ended june  on december   we paid million of dividends to our shareholders relating to the quarter ended september  on march   we paid million of dividends to our shareholders relating to the quarter ended december  on june   we paid million to our shareholders relating to the quarter ended march  on september  we paid million to our shareholders relating to the quarter ended june  on december   we paid million to our shareholders relating to the quarter ended september  on february   our board of directors announced that we will be paying a quarterly dividend of per share on or about march  to the shareholders of record as of march  the aggregate amount of the dividend is expected to be million  which we anticipate will be funded from cash on hand at the time payment is to be made 
on february   we announced that our board of directors declared a special  one time cash dividend of per share 
the dividend will be paid on or about march  to shareholders of record as of march  we intend to fund substantially the entire amount of the special dividend payment through new borrowings under our credit facility 
we also announced on february  that our board of directors changed our quarterly dividend policy by adopting a fixed target amount of per share per quarter or per share each year  starting with the first quarter of we intend to declare dividends in april  july  october and february of each year 
any dividends paid will be subject to the terms and conditions of our credit facility and applicable provisions of marshall islands law 
share repurchase program in october and february  the company s board of directors approved repurchases by the company of its common stock under a share repurchase program for up to an aggregate total of million  of which million is available as of december  the board will periodically review the program 
share repurchases will be made from time to time for cash in open market transactions at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions 
the timing and amount of purchases under the program will be determined by management based upon market conditions and other factors 
purchases may be made pursuant to a program adopted under rule b under the securities exchange act 
the program does not require the company to purchase any specific number or amount of shares and may be suspended or reinstated at any time in the company s discretion and without notice 
repurchases will be subject to the terms of our credit facility  which are described in further detail below 
through december   the company has acquired  shares of its common stock for million using borrowings under its credit facility and funds from operations 
all of these shares have been retired 
debt financings credit facility on october   we entered into an million revolving credit facility the credit facility with a syndicate of commercial lenders 
the credit facility has been used to refinance the refinancing the existing term borrowings under our million senior secured bank financing facility entered into on july  the credit facility 
pursuant to the refinancing  we repaid million outstanding under the term loan of our credit facility primarily by making an initial drawdown of million and using million of cash held in escrow 
upon consummating the refinancing  unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the credit facility aggregating million were written off as a non cash charge in october this non cash charge is classified as other income expense on the statement of operations 
in connection with the refinancing  we incurred deferred financing costs of million in october the credit facility provides a four year nonamortizing revolving loan with semiannual reductions of million beginning october  and a bullet reduction of million on october  up to million of the credit facility will be available for the issuance of stand by letters of credit to support obligations of the company and its subsidiaries that are reasonably acceptable to the issuing lenders under the facility

as of december   we are in compliance with all of the covenants under the credit facility 
credit facility refinanced by the credit facility on july   we closed on an million senior secured bank financing facility credit facility consisting of a term loan of million and a revolving loan of million 
the term loan had a five year maturity at a rate of libor plus and was to amortize on a quarterly basis with payments of million and one payment of million 
the revolving loan component  which did not amortize  had a five year maturity at a rate of libor plus on the used portion and a commitment fee on the unused portion 
concurrent with the closing of the credit facility  pursuant to which we borrowed million under the term loan and million under the revolving credit facility  we retired our then outstanding credit facilities the refinancing 
at the time of the refinancing  the credit facility was secured by the vessels which collateralized the then outstanding credit facilities and five vessels which were acquired during in addition  each of our subsidiaries which had an ownership interest in any vessel that was secured by the credit facility had provided unconditional guaranties of all amounts owing under the credit facility 
deferred financing costs incurred relating to the credit facility aggregated million 
upon consummating the refinancing  unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the then outstanding credit facilities aggregating million was written off as a non cash charge in july this non cash charge is classified as other income expense on the statement of operations 
under this credit facility  we were required to maintain certain ratios such as vessel market values to total outstanding loans and undrawn revolving credit facilities  ebitda to net interest expense and to maintain minimum levels of working capital 
in addition  the credit facility  as amended  permitted us to pay dividends with respect to any fiscal quarter up to an amount equal to ebitda as defined for such fiscal quarter less fleet renewal reserves  which are established by our board of directors  net interest expense and cash taxes  in the event taxes are paid  for such fiscal quarter 
such amount was to be reduced to the extent that the aggregate amount permitted to be paid for dividends for all fiscal quarters since january  is a negative amount 
however  we would not have been permitted to pay dividends if certain significant defaul ts as defined under the credit facility were to occur 
during the year ended december   we paid dividends of million 
interest rate swap agreements in august and october  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with foreign banks to manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates 
at their inception  these swaps had notional principal amounts equal to of our term loans outstanding at that time 
the notional principal amounts amortize at the same rate as the term loans

the differential to be paid or received for these swap agreements was recognized as an adjustment to interest expense as incurred through september  as of december   the company is no longer party to any interest rate swap agreements 
we would have received approximately  to settle all outstanding swap agreements based upon their aggregate fair values as of december  this fair value is based upon estimates received from financial institutions 
senior notes on march   we issued million of senior notes which were due march  the senior notes 
interest was paid on the senior notes each march and september the senior notes were general unsecured  senior obligations of the company

capital expenditures for drydockings and vessel acquisitions drydocking in addition to vessel acquisition  other major capital expenditures include funding our maintenance program of regularly scheduled in water survey or drydocking necessary to preserve the quality of our vessels as well as to comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations 
management anticipates that vessels which are younger than years are required to undergo in water surveys years after a drydock and that vessels are to be drydocked every five years  while vessels years or older are to be drydocked every years in which case the additional drydocks take the place of these in water surveys 
during the year ended december   we paid million of drydock related costs 
during  we anticipate that we will capitalize costs associated with drydocks or significant in water surveys on four vessels and that the expenditures to perform these drydocks will aggregate approximately million to million 
the ability to meet this maintenance schedule will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations  utilize our revolving credit facilities or to secure additional financing

other derivative financial instruments freight derivatives as part of our business strategy  we may from time to time enter into freight derivative contracts to hedge and manage market risks relating to the deployment of our existing fleet of vessels 
generally  these freight derivative contracts are futures contracts that would bind us and each counterparty in the arrangement to buy or sell a specified notional amount of tonnage forward at an agreed time and price and for a particular route 
these contracts generally settle based on the monthly baltic tanker index bitr  which is a worldscale index  and a may also include a specified bunker price index 
the bitr averages rates received in the spot market by cargo type  crude oil and refined petroleum products  and by trade route 
the duration of a contract can be one month  quarterly or up to three years with open positions settling on a monthly basis 
although freight derivatives can be entered into for a variety of purposes  including for hedging  as an option  for trading or for arbitrage  if we decided to enter into freight derivatives  our objective would be to hedge and manage market risks as part of our commercial management 
if we determine to enter into freight derivatives  we may reduce our exposure to any declines in our results from operations due to weak market conditions or downturns  but may also limit our ability to benefit economically during periods of strong demand in the market 
during september and october  the company entered into four freight derivative contracts which expired in december these freight forward contracts involved contracts to provide a fixed number of theoretical voyages at fixed rates and settled based on the monthly bitr 
the company had taken short positions in these contracts  which reduced a portion of the company s exposure to the spot charter market by creating synthetic time charters 
at december   these contracts had no aggregate notional value  because they expired on december  the notional amount is based on a computation of the quantity of cargo or freight the contract specifies  the contract rate based on a certain trade route and a flat rate determined by the market on an annual basis 
each contract is marked to market for the specified cargo and trade route 
the fair value of forward freight agreements is the estimated amount that the company would receive or pay to terminate the agreements at the reporting date 
as of december   the company has recorded a liability of million related to the fair market value of these economic hedges 
the company has recorded the aggregate net realized and unrealized loss of million  for the year ended december   which is classified as other income expense on the statement of operations 
during may  the company entered into a freight derivative contract with the intention of fixing the equivalent of one suezmax vessel to a time charter equivalent rate of  per day for a three year period beginning on july  this contract net settles each month with the company receiving  per day and paying a floating amount based on the monthly bitr and a specified bunker price index 
as of december   the fair market value of the freight derivative  which was determined based on the aggregate discounted cash flows using estimated future rates obtained from brokers as of december   resulted in an asset to the company of million 
the company recorded an unrealized gain of million for the year ended december  which is reflected on the company s statement of operations as other income expense 
the company has recorded an aggregate realized loss of million for the year ended december   which is classified as other income expense on the statement of operations 
currency forward contract the company entered into  on july   a forward contract to acquire million euros on january  for million 
changes in the fair value of this forward contract subsequent to the date on which the company entered into the contract at which time the fair value was was recorded as other income expense on the company s statement of operations 
the company entered into this contract to guard against weakening in the dollar against the euro 
as of december   the company has recorded a liability of million related to the fair market value of this derivative financial instrument 
the company has recorded an aggregate net unrealized gain loss of million and million  for the years ended december  and  which is classified as other income expense on the statement of operations 
as of december   the company is not party to any currency forward contracts 
bunker collar during the year ended december   the company entered into a costless collar to obtain a quantity of fuel between metric ton mt and mt 
the company used this derivative as an economic hedge to the company  but did not designated this derivative as a hedge for accounting purposes 
as such  changes in the fair value of the derivative were recorded to the company s statement of income each reporting period 
under this agreement  the company had a right to receive call option the amount by which the bunker price on a specified index exceeds mt and an obligation to pay put option the amount by which mt exceeds the bunker price on a specified index 
the term was for a notional  mt of bunkers per month for each month in the period between october  and march  as of december   the company recorded an asset of  related to the fair market value of this economic hedge 
the company has recorded an aggregate net unrealized loss gain of  and  respectively  for the years ended december  and  which is classified as other income expense on the statement of operations 
in addition  the company paid  to the counterparty to settle this contract during the year ended december   which is classified as other income expense on the statement of operations 
as of december   we are not party to any bunker collar contracts 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of those financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments or uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have described below what we believe are our most critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
revenue is generally recorded when services are rendered  the company has a signed charter agreement or other evidence of an arrangement  pricing is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
our revenues are earned under time charters or voyage contracts 
revenue from time charters is earned and recognized on a daily basis 
certain time charters contain provisions which provide for adjustments to time charter rates based on agreed upon market rates 
revenue for voyage contracts is recognized based upon the percentage of voyage completion 
the percentage of voyage completion is based on the number of voyage days worked at the balance sheet date divided by the total number of days expected on the voyage 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we do not provide any reserve for doubtful accounts associated with our voyage revenues because we believe that our customers are of high creditworthiness and there are no serious issues concerning collectibility 
we have had an excellent collection record during the past six years ended december  to the extent that some voyage revenues become uncollectible  the amounts of these revenues would be expensed at that time 
we provide a reserve for our demurrage revenues based upon our historical record of collecting these amounts 
as of december   we provided a reserve of approximately for these claims  which we believe is adequate in light of our collection history 
we periodically review the adequacy of this reserve so that it properly reflects our collection history 
to the extent that our collection experience warrants a greater reserve we will incur an expense as to increase this amount in that period 
in addition  certain of our time charter contracts contain speed and fuel consumption provisions 
we have a reserve for potential claims  which is based on the amount of cumulative time charter revenue recognized under these contracts which we estimate may need to be repaid to the charterer due to failure to meet these speed and fuel consumption provisions 
depreciation and amortization 
we record the value of our vessels at their cost which includes acquisition costs directly attributable to the vessel and expenditures made to prepare the vessel for its initial voyage less accumulated depreciation 
we depreciate our non single hull vessels on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  estimated to be years from date of initial delivery from the shipyard 
we believe that a year depreciable life for double hull and double sided vessels is consistent with that of other ship owners and with its economic useful life 
depreciation is based on cost less the estimated residual scrap value 
we estimate our residual scrap value per lightweight ton to be an increase in the useful life of the vessel would have the effect of decreasing the annual depreciation charge and extending it into later periods 
an increase in the residual scrap value as was done in would decrease the amount of the annual depreciation charge 
a decrease in the useful life of the vessel would have the effect of increasing the annual depreciation charge 
a decrease in the residual scrap value would increase the amount of the annual depreciation charge 
replacements  renewals and betterments 
we capitalize and depreciate the costs of significant replacements  renewals and betterments to our vessels over the shorter of the vessel s remaining useful life or the life of the renewal or betterment 
the amount capitalized is based on our judgment as to expenditures that extend a vessel s useful life or increase the operational efficiency of a vessel 
we believe that these criteria are consistent with gaap and that our policy of capitalization reflects the economics and market values of our vessels 
costs that are not depreciated are written off as a component of direct vessel operating expense during the period incurred 
expenditures for routine maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
if the amount of the expenditures we capitalize for replacements  renewals and betterments to our vessels were reduced  we would recognize the amount of the difference as an expense 
deferred drydock costs 
our vessels are required to be drydocked approximately every to months for major repairs and maintenance that cannot be performed while the vessels are operating 
we capitalize the costs associated with the drydocks as they occur and amortize these costs on a straight line basis over the period between drydocks 
we believe that these criteria are consistent with gaap guidelines and industry practice  and that our policy of capitalization reflects the economics and market values of the vessels 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying amounts and periods over which long lived assets are depreciated to determine if events have occurred which would require modification to their carrying values or useful lives 
in evaluating useful lives and carrying values of long lived assets  we review certain indicators of potential impairment  such as undiscounted projected operating cash flows  vessel sales and purchases  business plans and overall market conditions 
we determine undiscounted projected net operating cash flows for each vessel and compare it to the vessel carrying value 
in the event that impairment occurred  we would determine the fair value of the related asset and we record a charge to operations calculated by comparing the asset s carrying value to the estimated fair value 
we estimate fair value primarily through the use of third party valuations performed on an individual vessel basis 
various factors including future charter rates and vessel operating costs are included in this analysis 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin requires the use of a two step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions 
we are required to adopt fin effective january  any impact from the adoption of fin will be recorded directly to the beginning balance of retained earnings and reported as a change in accounting principle 
only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized upon adoption of fin we qualify for an exemption pursuant to section of the us internal revenue code of  or the code  from us federal income tax on our shipping income that is derived from us sources 
we are similarly exempt from state and local income taxation 
we have also evaluated our tax positions with respect to other countries in which we have commercial or technical management operations and do not believe that the adoption of this interpretation will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas on september  sfas enhances existing guidance for measuring assets and liabilities using fair value 
previously  guidance for applying fair value was incorporated in several accounting pronouncements 
the new statement provides a single definition of fair value  together with a framework for measuring it  and requires additional disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
while the statement does not add any new fair value measurements  it does change current practice 
one such change is a requirement to adjust the value of nonvested stock for the effect of the restriction even if the restriction lapses within one year 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas on january   will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the united states securities and exchange commission sec issued sab no 
considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  which provides interpretive guidance on how registrants should quantify financial statement misstatements 
under sab registrants are required to consider both a rollover method  which focuses primarily on the income statement impact of misstatements  and the iron curtain method  which focuses primarily on the balance sheet impact of misstatements 
the effects of prior year uncorrected errors include the potential accumulation of improper amounts that may result in a material misstatement on the balance sheet or the reversal of prior period errors in the current period that result in a material misstatement of the current period income statement amounts 
adjustments to current or prior period financial statements would be required in the event that after application of various approaches for assessing materiality of a misstatement in current period financial statements and consideration of all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors  a misstatement is determined to be material 
we adopted the provisions of sab as of december  the adoption of sab did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

under this statement  the company may elect to report financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on a contract by contract basis with changes in value reported in earnings 
this election is irrevocable 
sfas is effective for the company commencing in early adoption within days of the beginning of the company s fiscal year is permissible  provided the company has adopted sfas no 
the company is currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on its consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates 
the exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our debt 
at december   we had million of floating rate debt with a margin over libor of compared to december  when we had million of floating rate debt with margins over libor ranging from to 
until july   we used interest rate swaps to manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
as of july   we stopped designating our interest rate swaps as a hedge 
the differential to be paid or received under these swap agreements was accrued as interest rates change and was recognized as an adjustment to interest expense through june  and other income expense thereafter 
as of december   we were party to interest rate swap agreements having aggregate notional amounts of million  respectively  which effectively fixed libor on a like amount of principal at rates ranging from to 
these interest rate swap agreements expired in june a one percent increase in libor would increase interest expense on the portion of our million outstanding floating rate indebtedness  which is not economically hedged  by approximately million per year from december  foreign exchange rate risk the international tanker industry s functional currency is the us dollar 
virtually all of the company s revenues and most of its operating costs are in us dollars 
the company incurs certain operating expenses  drydocking  and overhead costs in foreign currencies  the most significant of which is the euro  as well as british pounds  japanese yen  singapore dollars  australian dollars and norwegian kroners 
during the year ended december   approximately of the company s direct vessel operating expenses and general and administrative expenses were denominated in these currencies 
the potential additional expense from a adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates  as it relates to all of these currencies  would be approximately million for the year ended december  on july   the company entered into a forward contract to acquire million euros on january  for million 
the company entered into this contract to guard against weakening in the dollar against the euro 
the company has recorded an aggregate net unrealized gain of million for the year ended december   which is classified as other income on the statement of operations 
as of december   the company is not party to any currency forward contracts 
charter rate risk as part of our business strategy  we may from time to time enter into freight derivative contracts to hedge and manage market risks relating to the deployment of our existing fleet of vessels 
generally  these freight derivative contracts are futures contracts that would bind us and each counterparty in the arrangement to buy or sell a specified notional amount of tonnage forward at an agreed time and price and for a particular route 
our objective would be to hedge and manage market risks as part of our commercial management 
during may  the company entered into a freight derivative contract with the intention of fixing the equivalent of one suezmax vessel to a time charter equivalent rate of  per day for a three year period beginning on july  this contract net settles each month with the company receiving  per day and paying a floating amount based on the monthly bitr and a specified bunker price index 
the aggregate notional value of this contract is million as of december  as of december   the fair market value of the freight derivative contract resulted in an asset to the company of million and a net unrealized and realized gain million for the year ended december   which is reflected on our statement of operations as other income expense 
a increase in the forward bitr from the december  levels would result in additional payments to the counterparty of million over the period from january  to june  a decrease in the specified bunker price forward index from the december  level would result in additional payments to the counterparty of million over the period from january  to june
