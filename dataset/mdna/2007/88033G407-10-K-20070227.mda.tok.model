item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction to management s discussion and analysis the purpose of this section  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  is to provide a narrative explanation of our financial statements that enables investors to better understand our business  to enhance our overall financial disclosures  to provide the context within which financial information may be analyzed  and to provide information about the quality of  and potential variability of  our results of operations and cash flows 
unless otherwise indicated  all financial and statistical information included herein relates to our continuing operations  with dollar amounts expressed in millions except per share amounts 
this information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
it includes the following sections executive overview sources of revenue results of operations liquidity and capital resources off balance sheet arrangements recently issued accounting standards critical accounting estimates executive overview key developments during  we continued to focus on the execution of our turnaround strategies 
while we saw certain areas of improvement this year  we are still facing several industry and company specific challenges that continue to negatively affect our progress 
we are dedicated to improving our patients  shareholders and other stakeholders confidence in us 
we still believe we will do that by providing quality care and generating positive growth and earnings at our hospitals 
key developments include the following events new independent auditor in january  we announced that deloitte touche llp had been selected by our audit committee as our new independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending december  the engagement of deloitte touche will be submitted for ratification by our shareholders at our may annual meeting 
new inpatient tower at usc university hospital in january  we announced the opening of the norris inpatient tower  a state of the art  million  ten story building connected to our usc university hospital 
the norris inpatient tower will have beds  which significantly expands the hospital s capacity for treating patients with cancer and other life threatening illnesses and supporting advanced medical research 
new ten year it outsourcing agreement in november  we signed a new contract with perot systems corporation that expands  extends and strengthens the information technology support and management services that perot systems has provided for us and our hospitals since we expect the agreement will enhance our information systems to provide a strong foundation for the introduction of advanced medical information technology designed to further improve quality of care and patient safety at all of our hospitals 
the new contract also restructures our previous agreement to better fit our smaller size after recent divestitures 
in addition  the agreement provides for the global outsourcing of certain information technology support functions 
aggregate fees under the agreement are expected to be approximately billion over the ten year term of the contract 
irs audit and settlement in october  we received a revenue agent s report related to the recently completed internal revenue service irs audit of our tax returns for fiscal years ended may  through the seven month transition period ended december  the report assessed an aggregate tax deficiency of million plus interest million as of december  
of the million proposed assessment  approximately million is attributable to issues that are not in dispute 
after taking into account net operating losses from  which offset a portion of the undisputed tax deficiency  the remaining undisputed amount is reduced to approximately million 
we paid this undisputed tax deficiency of million  plus interest thereon of million  in december in november  we also reached a partial settlement with the irs related to issues that were in dispute for fiscal years  and and paid million as an advance payment of taxes and interest owed under the settlement  with respect to those matters 
new revolving credit facility in september  we accepted a commitment from a group of banks for a five year  million senior secured revolving credit facility  which we closed in november  thereby replacing our million letter of credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is collateralized by patient accounts receivable  and can be increased to billion depending on the amount of eligible receivables outstanding 
existing letters of credit were transferred into the revolving credit facility  which reduced the amount available for cash borrowings  but eliminated the restriction on million of cash pledged under our prior letter of credit agreement 
the new credit facility is subject to customary covenants for an asset backed facility 
the covenants include a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio to be met when the available credit under the facility falls below million  as well as limits on debt  liens  asset sales and prepayments of senior debt 
standard poor s lowered its credit rating on our senior unsecured notes two notches to ccc due to the large amount of priority debt that now exists  but changed its outlook on our corporate credit rating from negative to stable  reflecting our recently improved managed care pricing  better expense management  asset divestiture plan and the elimination of key litigation risks 
moody s lowered its credit rating on our unsecured notes one notch to caa  but also affirmed the corporate family rating of b in addition  moody s changed the rating outlook on the corporate family rating from negative to stable 
expiration of operating leases in august  metrocrest hospital authority announced that another company was selected to manage rhd memorial medical center in farmers branch  texas and trinity medical center in carrollton  texas following the expiration of our operating lease 
the results of these hospitals will be included in continuing operations until the lease expires in august for the years ended december  and  the combined operating loss of these two hospitals was million and million  respectively 
as of december   our investment in the collateralized bonds issued by the local hospital authority was million 
of this amount  million matures in and million matures in settlement reached over katrina insurance claims in july  we announced a million settlement had been reached with our property insurers regarding claims related to the physical damage and business interruption we sustained as a result of hurricane katrina in we received million in july  in addition to the million previously received  in full resolution of our claims 
with the settlement  we have avoided a protracted resolution process fraught with the disagreements and differences over interpretation that can occur in insurance claims of this magnitude and complexity 
as provided in our insurance contracts  we have the flexibility to apply these funds to meet our overall capital needs 
global civil settlement and corporate integrity agreement in june  we entered into a broad civil settlement agreement with the us department of justice and other federal agencies that concluded several previously disclosed governmental investigations  including inquiries into our receipt of certain medicare outlier payments before  physician financial arrangements and medicare coding issues 
under the terms of the settlement  we will pay million  plus interest  over a four year period and waive our right to pursue receipt of million in unrecorded medicare payments for past services 
with this global settlement and the previously announced settlements of the criminal case involving alvarado hospital medical center  civil pricing litigation  a securities lawsuit and shareholder derivative litigation  and several issues with the florida attorney general  as well as certain other legal matters  we have now resolved the majority of lawsuits and investigations related to legacy issues that had been ongoing for the past several years 
as part of the global settlement  we entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general of the us department of health and human services in september the agreement requires us to maintain our quality initiatives  compliance program and code of conduct  as well as formalize in writing our policies and procedures in the areas of billing and reimbursement  federal anti kickback and stark laws  and clinical quality 
it also establishes general and specialized training requirements and compliance reviews by independent organizations in the areas of medicare outlier payments  diagnosis related group claims  unallowable costs  physician financial arrangements and clinical quality systems 
because of the many changes and enhancements we have made in the past three years  we already had in place a number of the procedures and systems called for by the agreement  therefore  we do not anticipate compliance with this agreement to create a significant burden on us or have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
strategic divestitures in june  we announced our strategic plan to divest general hospitals  primarily to enhance our future profitability  provide funds to expand capital investments at our remaining hospitals and help fund our global civil settlement with the federal government 
in addition to gulf coast medical center in biloxi  mississippi  which we sold in june for estimated net after tax proceeds of million  alvarado hospital medical center  which we agreed to divest as part of our may settlement with the us attorney in san diego and sold in january for estimated pretax proceeds of million  and other hospitals currently held for sale or already sold  these hospitals are reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented in this report 
the hospitals included four in the new orleans area kenner regional medical center  lindy boggs medical center  meadowcrest hospital and memorial medical center because of uncertainties in the new orleans market and the need for health care consolidation there in the aftermath of hurricane katrina  three of our five hospitals in philadelphia graduate hospital  roxborough memorial hospital and warminster hospital  and three of our florida hospitals hollywood medical center  parkway regional medical center and cleveland clinic hospital 
in september  we completed the sale of kenner regional medical center  meadowcrest hospital and memorial medical center 
pretax proceeds are estimated to be approximately million 
in addition  the buyer has agreed to reimburse us approximately million for our costs related to the reconstruction of the new orleans surgical and heart institute on the campus of memorial medical center 
also in september  we completed the sale of our partnership interest in cleveland clinic hospital for pretax proceeds  including the repayment of partnership loans from us  of approximately million 
in november  we completed the sale of hollywood medical center for pretax proceeds of approximately million and  in december  we sold parkway regional medical center for estimated pretax proceeds of approximately million 
discussions and negotiations with potential buyers for the remaining hospitals slated for divestiture are ongoing 
strategic development of outpatient services in may  we announced that we had formed a national strategic development group to focus on our freestanding and hospital based outpatient services and facilities 
we currently operate more than imaging and diagnostic centers  more than ambulatory surgery centers and a number of other outpatient facilities 
in addition  we have outpatient projects currently in development  most of them on the campuses of our hospitals 
the strategic group s goal is to ensure that each of our hospitals and markets is actively pursuing multiple outpatient growth opportunities 
significant challenges our june global civil settlement with the federal government and other previously announced settlements have resolved several material threats to our company and should help us move forward in our turnaround strategy 
however  there are still significant challenges  both company specific and industry wide  that will impact the timing of our turnaround 
below is a summary of these items 
company specific challenge volumes we believe the reasons for declines in our volumes include  but are not limited to  decreases in the demand for invasive cardiac procedures  increased competition  physician attrition  managed care contract negotiations or terminations  a declining population in florida  and the impact of our litigation and government investigations 
we are taking a number of steps in addition to the settlement of litigation and government investigations to address the problem of volume decline  however  due to the concentration of our hospitals in california  florida and texas  we may not be able to mitigate some factors contributing to volume declines 
one of these initiatives is our physician sales and service program  which is centered around understanding the needs of physicians who admit patients both to our hospitals and to our competitors hospitals and responding to those needs with changes and improvements in our hospitals and operations 
we accelerated capital spending for in order to address specific needs of our hospitals  which is expected to have a positive impact on their volumes 
we are also completing clinical service line market demand analysis and profitability assessments to determine which services are highly valued that can be emphasized and marketed to improve results 
this targeted growth initiative has resulted in some reductions in unprofitable service lines in several locations  which have had a slightly negative impact on our volumes 
however  the elimination of these unprofitable service lines will allow us to focus more resources on services that are highly valued and more profitable 
our commitment to quality initiative  which we launched in  should further help position us to competitively meet the volume challenge 
we are working with physicians to implement the most current evidence based techniques to improve the way we provide care 
our hospitals have improved substantially in quality metrics reported by the government and have been recognized by several managed care companies for their quality of care 
we have seen an increase in admissions for certain service lines at our facilities that have been designated as centers of excellence by managed care companies due to their record of quality clinical outcomes 
although centers of excellence designations are limited  certain managed care companies are offering attractive financial incentives to their members to encourage the use of centers of excellence designated service lines that have consistently achieved improved clinical outcomes 
we believe that quality of care improvements will continue to have the effect of increasing physician and patient satisfaction  potentially improving our volumes as a result 
significant industry trends bad debt like other organizations in the health care industry  we continue to provide services to a high volume of uninsured patients and more patients than in prior years with an increased burden of co payments and deductibles as a result of changes in their health care plans 
although the discounting components of our compact have reduced and are expected to continue to reduce our provision for doubtful accounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements  they are not expected to mitigate the net economic effects of treating uninsured or underinsured patients 
we continue to experience a high level of uncollectible accounts 
our collection efforts have improved  and we continue to focus  where applicable  on placement of patients in various government programs such as medicaid 
however  unless our business mix shifts toward a greater number of insured patients or the trend of higher co payments and deductibles reverses  we anticipate this high level of uncollectible accounts to continue 
cost pressures labor and supply costs remain a significant cost pressure facing us as well as the industry in general 
we have slowed the rates of increase in both labor and supply costs and have been able to contain our unit cost growth below the rate of medical inflation 
maintaining this level of cost control in an environment of declining patient volumes and increasing labor union activity will continue to be a challenge 
results of operations overview our results of operations for the last three years reflect the progress we have made in restructuring our operations to focus on a smaller group of general hospitals 
our turnaround timeframe has been and continues to be influenced by industry trends such as bad debt levels and by company specific challenges  such as decreasing volumes and demand for inpatient cardiac procedures  that continue to negatively affect our revenue growth and operating expenses 
our future profitability depends on volume growth  adequate reimbursement levels and cost control 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net inpatient revenue per patient day and per admission increased by and  respectively  due primarily to the effect of newly negotiated levels of reimbursement from our managed care contracts  partially offset by additional discounts under the compact during the phase in process 
patient days were down and admissions were down 
net outpatient revenue per visit increased  while outpatient visits declined 
the increase in revenue per visit is due primarily to higher medicare and medicaid reimbursement and the effect of newly negotiated levels of reimbursement from our managed care contracts  partially offset by additional discounts under the compact during the phase in process 
loss per diluted share from continuing operations of in the current year increased from the loss per diluted share of in the prior year due primarily to the current year s litigation settlements and impairments 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net inpatient revenue per patient day and per admission increased by and  respectively  due primarily to the effect of newly negotiated levels of reimbursement from our managed care contracts and slightly higher medicare reimbursement levels  offset by additional discounts under the compact during the phase in process 
net outpatient revenue per visit increased  while outpatient visits declined 
the increase in revenue per visit is due primarily to higher emergency room volume  a positive shift in payer mix and the sale or closure of certain home health agencies  hospices and clinics  which businesses typically generate lower revenue per visit amounts than other outpatient services  partially offset by additional discounts under the compact during the phase in process and lower rehabilitation visits 
favorable net adjustments for prior year cost reports and related valuation allowances  related primarily to medicare and medicaid  of million in increased compared to similar favorable adjustments of million in cash generated by operating activities was million during compared to cash used by operations of million during  reflecting an income tax refund of million received in march and lower restructuring and litigation settlement payments 
loss per diluted share from continuing operations of in decreased from the loss per diluted share of in due primarily to lower impairments

in november  we entered into a five year  million senior secured revolving credit facility  that replaced our million letter of credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is collateralized by patient accounts receivable at our acute care and specialty hospitals  and bears interest at our option based on the london interbank offered rate plus basis points or citigroup s base rate  as defined in the credit agreement  plus basis points 
after six months from the start of the credit agreement  the interest spread over the london interbank offered rate and citigroup s base rate may be reduced by basis points if our leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement  is below the defined threshold 
the letters of credit outstanding under our previous letter of credit facility were transferred into the revolving credit facility  which reduced the amount available for cash borrowings  but eliminated the restriction on million of cash pledged under the letter of credit agreement 
at december   there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
in january  we sold million of senior notes due in the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were approximately million after deducting discounts and related expenses 
we used a portion of the proceeds in february for the early redemption of the remaining million aggregate principal amount outstanding on our senior notes due in and  and the balance of the proceeds for general corporate purposes 
in june  we sold billion of senior notes due in the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were approximately million after deducting discounts and related expenses 
we used a portion of the proceeds to repurchase million of our senior notes due in  million of our senior notes due in and million of our senior notes due in we are currently in compliance with all covenants and conditions in our revolving credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
in addition  we had approximately million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand and borrowing capacity of million under our revolving credit facility as of december  sources of revenue we receive revenues for patient services from a variety of sources  primarily managed care payers including preferred provider organizations and health maintenance organizations and the federal medicare program  as well as state medicaid programs  indemnity based health insurance companies and self pay patients patients who do not have health insurance and are not covered by some other form of third party arrangement 
the table below shows the sources of net patient revenues for our general hospitals  expressed as percentages of net patient revenues from all sources years ended december  net patient revenues from medicare medicaid managed care indemnity  self pay and other includes medicare advantage and medicaid managed care 
the decrease in indemnity  self pay and other net patient revenues since is due primarily to the implementation of the discounting components of the compact 
our payer mix on an admissions basis for our general hospitals  expressed as a percentage of total admissions from all sources  is shown below years ended december  admissions from medicare medicaid managed care indemnity  self pay and other includes medicare advantage and medicaid managed care 
the increase in managed care admissions since is due primarily to an overall shift in our patient mix from medicare and medicaid to managed medicare and medicaid as further discussed below 
government programs the medicare program  the nation s largest health insurance program  is administered by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms of the us department of health and human services 
medicare is a health insurance program primarily for individuals years of age and older  certain younger people with disabilities  and people with end stage renal disease  and is provided without regard to income or assets 
medicaid is a program that pays for medical and health related services for certain individuals and families with low incomes and resources  and is jointly funded by the federal government and state governments 
medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health related services for the nation s poorest and most vulnerable populations 
these government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations and determinations  requirements for utilization review  and federal and state funding restrictions  all of which could materially increase or decrease payments from these government programs in the future  as well as affect the cost of providing services to our patients and the timing of payments to our facilities 
we are unable to predict the effect of future government health care funding policy changes on our operations 
if the rates paid by governmental payers are reduced  if the scope of services covered by governmental payers is limited or if we  or one or more of our subsidiaries hospitals  are excluded from participation in the medicare or medicaid program or any other government health care program  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
medicare medicare offers beneficiaries different ways to obtain their medical benefits 
one option  the original medicare plan  is a fee for service payment system 
the other option  called medicare advantage formerly medicare choice  includes managed care  preferred provider organization  private fee for service and specialty plans 
the major components of our net patient revenues for services provided to patients enrolled in the original medicare plan for the years ended december   and are set forth in the table below years ended december  revenue descriptions diagnosis related group operating diagnosis related group capital outlier outpatient disproportionate share direct graduate and indirect medical education inpatient psychiatric inpatient rehabilitation other adjustments for prior year cost reports and related valuation allowances total medicare net patient revenues the other revenue category includes skilled nursing facilities  one prospective payment system pps exempt cancer hospital  one long term acute care hospital  other revenue adjustments  and adjustments related to the current year cost reports and related valuation allowances 
acute care hospital inpatient prospective payment system diagnosis related group payments sections d and g of the social security act the act set forth a system of payments for the operating and capital costs of acute care hospital stays based on a prospective payment system 
under the inpatient prospective payment system ipps  medicare payments for hospital inpatient operating and capital related costs are made at predetermined rates for each hospital discharge 
discharges are classified according to a list of diagnosis related groups drgs  which group patients with similar clinical characteristics that are expected to require similar amounts of hospital resources 
cms assigns to each drg a relative weight that represents the average resources required to care for cases in that particular drg  relative to the average resources used to treat cases in all drgs 
effective october   the ipps includes drgs to which a relative weight has been assigned 
the base payment amount for operating costs is comprised of an average standardized amount that is divided into a labor related share and a nonlabor related share 
both the labor related share of the operating base payments and the capital base payments are adjusted by the geographic variations in labor and capital costs 
these base payments are multiplied by the relative weight of the drg assigned to each case 
although these payments are adjusted for area labor and capital cost differentials  the adjustments do not take into consideration an individual hospital s operating and capital costs 
the drg operating and capital base rates are updated annually  giving consideration to the increased cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals 
the rate increases that became effective on october  and october  were and  respectively 
outlier payments outlier payments are additional payments made to hospitals for treating medicare patients who are costlier to treat than the average patient in the same drg 
to qualify as a cost outlier  a hospital s billed charges  adjusted to cost  must exceed the payment rate for the drg by a fixed threshold established annually by cms 
the medicare fiscal intermediary calculates the cost of a claim by multiplying the billed charges by a cost to charge ratio ccr that is typically based on the hospital s most recent filed cost report 
if the computed cost exceeds the sum of the drg payment plus the fixed threshold  the hospital receives of the difference as an outlier payment 
under the act  cms must project aggregate annual outlier payments to all pps hospitals to be not less than nor more than of total drg payments outlier percentage 
the outlier percentage is determined by dividing total outlier payments by the sum of drg and outlier payments 
cms annually adjusts the fixed threshold to bring expected outlier payments within the mandated limit 
a change to the fixed threshold affects total outlier payments by changing the number of cases that qualify for outlier payments  and the dollar amount hospitals receive for those cases that still qualify 
the increase in our outlier revenues since is primarily the result of a decrease in the payment threshold enacted by cms on october  and increases in the acuity and costs for many of the patients that appropriately qualify for this type of reimbursement 
as of august   an outlier rule went into effect for discharges occurring on or after that date 
pursuant to this rule  high cost outlier payments may be reconciled upon cost report settlement to account for the differences between the ccr used to pay the claim at its original submission by the provider and the ccr determined at final settlement of the cost reporting period during which the discharge occurred 
outlier payments are to be reconciled at the time of cost report settlement if the actual operating ccr is found to be plus or minus percentage points from the ccr used during that time period to make outlier payments and total outlier payments in that cost reporting period exceed  we are not aware of any material changes to our prior outlier payments that may occur as a result of this rule 
disproportionate share payments if a medicare participating hospital serves a disproportionate share of low income patients  it receives a percentage add on to the drg payment for each case 
this percentage varies  depending on several factors that include the percentage of low income patients served 
during  of our hospitals in continuing operations qualified for disproportionate share payments 
direct graduate and indirect medical education the medicare program provides additional reimbursement to approved teaching hospitals for additional expenses incurred by such institutions 
this additional reimbursement  which is subject to certain limits  including intern and resident full time equivalent fte caps established in  is made in the form of direct graduate medical education gme and indirect medical education ime payments 
during  of our hospitals in continuing operations were affiliated with academic institutions and were eligible to receive such payments 
medicare rules permit hospitals to enter into medicare gme affiliation agreements for the purpose of applying the fte limits on an aggregate basis  and some of our hospitals have entered into such agreements 
hospital outpatient prospective payment system under the outpatient prospective payment system  hospital outpatient services  except for certain services that are reimbursed on a separate fee schedule  are classified into groups called ambulatory payment classifications apcs 
services in each apc are similar clinically and in terms of the resources they require  and a payment rate is established for each apc 
depending on the services provided  hospitals may be paid for more than one apc for an encounter 
cms periodically updates the apcs and annually adjusts rates paid for each apc 
inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system effective january   cms implemented a new system of reimbursement for hospital inpatient psychiatric services to replace a cost based payment system 
the inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system ipf pps applies to psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units located within acute care hospitals that have been designated as exempt from the hospital inpatient prospective payment system 
the ipf pps includes several provisions to ease the transition to the new payment system 
for example  cms is phasing in the ipf pps for existing hospitals and units over a three year period to avoid disrupting the delivery of inpatient psychiatric services 
full payment under the ipf pps begins in the fourth year 
the ipf pps  which is based on prospectively determined per diem rates  includes a stop loss provision to protect providers against significant losses during the transition period  and an outlier policy that authorizes additional payments for extraordinarily costly cases 
at december   of our general hospitals in continuing operations operated medicare certified psychiatric units 
because of the aforementioned three year transition and stop loss provisions of the ipf pps  the new payment system has not had  and  we believe  will not have a material impact on our inpatient psychiatric payments 
inpatient rehabilitation prospective payment system rehabilitation hospitals and rehabilitation units in acute care hospitals meeting certain criteria established by cms are eligible to be paid as an inpatient rehabilitation facility irf under the irf prospective payment system irf pps 
payments under the irf pps are made on a per discharge basis 
a patient classification system is used to assign patients in irfs into case mix groups cmgs 
the irf pps uses federal prospective payment rates across distinct cmgs 
prior to july   a rehabilitation hospital or unit was eligible for classification as an irf if it could show that  during its most recent month cost reporting period  it served an inpatient population of whom at least percent required intensive rehabilitation services for the treatment of one or more of ten specific conditions 
this became known as the percent rule 
on may   cms released a final rule entitled medicare program  changes to the criteria for being classified as an inpatient rehabilitation facility irf rule that revised the medical condition criteria rehabilitation hospitals and units must meet 
the irf rule also replaced the percent rule compliance threshold with a three year transition compliance threshold of  and for years one  two and three  respectively  that commenced with cost reporting periods beginning on or after july  the three year transition period was later delayed by one year 
at the end of the three year transition period  the compliance threshold would be restored 
at december   we operated two inpatient rehabilitation hospitals  and of our general hospitals in continuing operations operated inpatient rehabilitation units 
all of our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and units are in compliance with the required compliance threshold 
cost reports the final determination of certain medicare payments to our hospitals  such as disproportionate share  gme  ime and bad debt expense  are retrospectively determined based on our hospitals cost reports 
the final determination of these payments often takes many years to resolve because of audits by the program representatives  providers rights of appeal  and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed the implementation of a new system and estimation process for recording medicare net patient revenue and estimated cost report settlements 
this resulted in recording accruals to more closely reflect the expected final settlements on our cost reports 
for filed cost reports  we record the accrual based on those cost reports and subsequent activity  and record a valuation allowance against those cost reports based on historical settlement trends 
the accrual for periods for which a cost report is yet to be filed is recorded based on estimates of what we expect to report on the filed cost reports and a corresponding valuation allowance is recorded as previously described 
cost reports must be filed generally within five months after the end of the annual cost report reporting period 
after the cost report is filed  the accrual and corresponding valuation allowance may need to be adjusted 
medicaid medicaid programs are funded by both the federal government and state governments 
these programs and the reimbursement methodologies are administered by the states and vary from state to state and from year to year 
estimated payments under various state medicaid programs  excluding state funded managed care programs  constituted approximately  and of net patient revenues at our continuing general hospitals for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these payments are typically based on fixed rates determined by the individual states 
we also receive disproportionate share payments under various state medicaid programs 
for the years ended december   and  our revenue attributable to disproportionate share payments and other supplemental payments was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in revenue from disproportionate share payments and other supplemental payments is primarily attributable to additional funding provided by certain states  which was made available in part by additional annual state provider taxes on certain of our hospitals and changes in classification of state programs 
however  there are proposed changes to the medicaid system that could materially reduce the amount of medicaid payments we receive in the future 
see regulatory and legislative changes medicaid federal state financial partnership below 
many states in which we operate are facing budgetary challenges that also pose a threat to medicaid funding levels to hospitals and other providers 
we expect these challenges to continue  however  we cannot predict the extent of the impact of the states budget reductions  if any  on our hospitals 
regulatory and legislative changes annual payment and policy changes to the medicare inpatient prospective payment system under medicare law  cms is required annually to update certain rules governing the ipps 
the updates generally become effective october  the beginning of the federal fiscal year ffy 
on august   cms issued the ipps final rule for ffy final rule 
the final rule includes the following payment policy changes a market basket increase of for drg operating payments for hospitals reporting specified quality measure data  an increase of market basket minus for hospitals not supplying quality measure data  a increase in the capital federal rate  a three year transition to change the methodology cms uses for calculating the drg relative weights from a charge basis to estimated hospital cost basis  a move toward a more complete severity adjustment by adding new groups to the current drg system  and an increase in the cost outlier threshold from  to  in the final rule  cms projected that the combined impact of the payment and policy changes contained therein would yield an average increase in payments for hospitals in large urban areas populations over million 
however  due to the unusual circumstances imposed by the order of the court of appeals for the second circuit in its decision in bellevue hospital center v 
leavitt  which related to the application of of the occupational mix to the wage index  cms was not able to provide the final ffy occupational mix adjusted wage index tables  payment rates or impacts in the final rule 
because the wage data affects the calculation of the outlier threshold  as well as the outlier offset and budget neutrality factors that are applied to the standardized amounts  cms was able to provide only tentative figures in the final rule 
on september   cms released a notice regarding the final ffy wage indices and payment rates after application of the revised occupational mix adjustment to the wage index 
cms projects that the revised impact of the ffy payment and policy changes after application of the occupational mix adjustment will still yield an average increase in payments for hospitals in large urban areas 
using cms projected impact percentage of for hospitals in large urban areas applied to our medicare ipps payments for the twelve months ended september   the annual impact for all changes in the final rule and the aforementioned notice on our hospitals in continuing operations may result in an estimated increase in our medicare revenues of approximately million 
because of the uncertainty regarding other factors that may influence our future ipps payments  including admission volumes  length of stay and case mix  we cannot provide any assurances regarding our estimate 
on november   cms issued a final rule that calls for hospitals seeking a full medicare ipps payment update to report additional quality measures for ffy  including  for the first time  risk adjusted outcomes measures 
these include day mortality measures for patients with three conditions heart attack  heart failure and pneumonia 
the final rule also calls for three new measures from the surgical care improvement project for patients undergoing surgical procedures 
we expect to be able to provide these additional quality measures 
payment and policy changes to the medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system on november   cms issued the final rule for the hospital outpatient prospective payment system and calendar year cy payment rates opps final rule 
the opps final rule includes the following payment and policy proposals a inflation update in medicare payment rates for hospital outpatient services paid under the outpatient prospective payment system opps  a move towards the use of additional quality measures that are specifically appropriate for hospital outpatient care to be developed by cms and reported by hospitals in cy  an expanded number of payment levels for services in outpatient clinics and emergency departments from three to five to match the levels for physician services  and a revision to the opps ambulatory payment classification structure for drug administration services  allowing hospitals to be paid separately for additional hours of infusion beyond the initial hour of infusion 
cms projects that the combined impact of the payment and policy changes in the opps final rule will yield an average increase in cy payments for all hospitals and an average increase in payments for hospitals located in large urban areas populations over one million 
applying the large urban hospital impact percentage from the opps final rule to our medicare outpatient payments for the twelve months ended december   the annual impact of all changes on our hospitals in continuing operations may result in an estimated increase in our medicare revenues of approximately million 
because of the uncertainty regarding other factors that may influence our future opps payments  including volumes and case mix  we cannot provide any assurances regarding this estimate 
payment and policy changes to the medicare inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system ipf pps on may   cms issued the final rule for the medicare inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system for ffy ipf pps rule 
the ipf pps rule  which became effective july   includes the following payment and policy changes a market basket increase of  and an increase to the fixed dollar loss threshold amount for outlier payments from  to  at december   of our general hospitals in continuing operations operated inpatient psychiatric units 
cms projects that the combined impact of the final payment and policy changes will yield an average increase in payments for all inpatient psychiatric facilities including psychiatric units in acute care hospitals  and an average increase in payments for psychiatric units of acute care hospitals located in urban areas 
applying the psychiatric unit impact percentage to our medicare ipf pps payments for the twelve months ended june   the annual impact of all changes on our hospitals psychiatric units in continuing operations may result in an estimated increase in our medicare revenues of approximately million 
because of the uncertainty regarding the factors that may influence our future ipf pps payments  including admission volumes  length of stay and case mix  we cannot provide any assurances regarding this estimate 
payment and policy changes to the medicare inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system irf pps on august   cms issued the final rule for the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system for ffy irf pps rule 
the irf pps rule includes the following payment policy changes an increase to the inpatient rehabilitation facility payment rate equal to the market basket of  a reduction in the standard payment to offset the effect of changes in coding  which  according to cms  do not reflect real changes in patient acuity  a one year extension of the admission criteria rule phase in period to conform to section of the deficit reduction act of the current compliance threshold will be extended for cost reporting periods that start on or after july  and before july   and an increase in the outlier threshold for high cost outlier cases from  to  cms projects that the combined impact of the payment and policy changes in the irf pps rule will yield an average increase in payments for all inpatient rehabilitation facilities including rehabilitation units in acute care hospitals  an average increase in payments for rehabilitation hospitals located in urban areas and an average increase in payments for rehabilitation units of hospitals located in urban areas 
applying the urban hospital and unit impact percentages from the irf pps rule to our medicare irf pps payments for the twelve months ended september   the annual impact of all changes on our rehabilitation hospitals and units in continuing operations may result in an estimated increase in our medicare revenues of approximately million 
because of the uncertainty regarding the factors that may influence our future irf pps payments  including admission volumes  length of stay and case mix  and the impact of compliance with the inpatient rehabilitation facility admission criteria  we cannot provide any assurances regarding this estimate 
specialty hospitals on june   cms announced the next steps it will take in connection with the end of an month moratorium imposed by the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of mma as to new specialty hospitals  which expired on june  cms has instructed medicare fiscal intermediaries not to process new provider enrollment applications for specialty hospitals until further notice 
in addition  cms stated that it will undertake the following steps during the suspension to reform medicare payments that may provide specialty hospitals with an unfair advantage over other types of providers  such as community hospitals or ambulatory surgical centers ascs reform payment rates for inpatient hospital services through changes to the drg system  reform payment rates for ascs  review procedures for approving hospitals for participation in medicare and closely scrutinize processes for approving and starting to pay new specialty hospitals  and seek public comment on the appropriate standards for specialty hospitals 
according to cms  these steps were designed to promote true and fair competition in hospital services  while improving quality and avoiding unnecessary costs for patients and for the medicare program 
on august   the temporary suspension on the processing of provider enrollment applications for specialty hospitals ended 
if specialty hospital provider enrollment applications are approved for new facilities in locations that can compete with our hospitals  we could face a reduction in volumes for some of our most profitable procedures 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of section of the mma requires that cms replace the current fiscal intermediary and carrier contracts with competitively procured contracts that conform to the federal acquisition regulation and are awarded to medicare administrative contractors each  a mac 
this initiative will reduce the number of entities currently providing medicare administrative services  such as claim processing and cost report settlements  from to cms has six years  between and  to complete the transition of medicare fee for service claims processing activities from the fiscal intermediaries and carriers to the macs 
tenet is considered a chain organization under medicare rules and  as of december   is served by a single fiscal intermediary for claims processing and cost report settlements 
in the opps final rule  cms is allowing all hospitals in a chain organization to be served by the mac awarded the jurisdiction in which the chain organization s home office is located in tenet s case  jurisdiction 
cms released a request for proposal for jurisdiction on september  and expects to award that contract in july in the event that tenet hospitals are required to undergo a change of fiscal intermediary as a result of the mac initiative  the conversion process to the mac s will commence in we cannot predict what impact  if any  the mac conversion initiative will have on our operations or cash flow 
medicare for ffys  and  hospitals will receive an inpatient update equal to the full market basket rate if they submit quality performance data to the us department of health and human services 
those hospitals not submitting quality performance data for quality measures will receive an increase equal to the market basket rate minus 
in order to qualify for the full market basket update  hospitals must submit performance data on all patients on the quality measures that are a subset of common hospital performance measures developed and aligned by cms and the joint commission formerly  the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations and endorsed by the national quality foundation 
effective october   all of our hospitals subject to this requirement received the full market basket update for ffy the indirect medical education adjustment decreased from in ffy to in ffy and will further decrease to in ffy it increases to for ffy and beyond 
medicaid the reduction in medicaid disproportionate share dsh hospital funding in ffy was eliminated and the dsh allotment increased over ffy levels 
subsequent years are frozen at levels until the allotment level intersects with where it would have been absent relief from the balanced budget act 
increases thereafter are tied to the change in the consumer price index 
long term care hospitals cms issued a proposed rule for long term care hospitals on february  that would provide for a increase in the payment rate  increase the fixed outlier threshold from  to  and revise the current short stay outlier provision to include a comparable inpatient prospective payment system amount for cases where the length of stay is less than or equal to the ipps threshold plus one standard deviation 
the proposed rule also seeks to extend the existing cap on admissions for long term care units within hospitals to virtually all long term care hospitals such that no long term care hospital with minor exceptions could receive more than of its admissions from a single source 
under the existing regulations  long term care hospital units that have been granted grandfather status are not subject to the cap on admissions from the host hospital or a single source 
tenet operates one long term care hospital unit that has been granted grandfather status 
we cannot predict the impact this proposed rule might have on our medicare net revenues 
the deficit reduction act of on february   the president signed the deficit reduction act of into law 
significant provisions of the legislation affecting hospitals include a one year extension  from july  through june   of the current compliance threshold of that inpatient rehabilitation facilities and units must meet to retain their irf status 
on july   the previously scheduled transition schedule ie  a threshold  followed by a threshold resumes 
effective for payments beginning in ffy  hospitals must submit data on additional quality measures 
cms must begin to adopt the baseline set of performance measures as set forth in the november report by the institute of medicine of the national academy of sciences under section b of the mma 
failure to submit the required data on the quality measures selected by cms will result in a market basket reduction 
this provision supplants the current reporting requirement under the mma described above 
for ffy  cms must add additional quality measures for hospitals to report to receive the maximum payment update available 
also  hospitals will be required to identify cases assigned to drgs that have higher payments when a hospital acquired infection is present 
cms must identify at least two conditions under which the hospital would receive the lower drg payment 
cms must establish a gainsharing demonstration project to test and evaluate methods and arrangements between hospitals and physicians to improve the quality and efficiency of care and hospital performance 
the demonstration is scheduled to run from january  to december  and have six demonstration sites  two of which must be rural 
certain imaging services provided in non hospital settings will be limited to the opps rates 
this change was implemented by regulation effective january  medicare payment advisory commission at a medicare payment advisory commission medpac meeting held on october   data was presented that suggested that only billion of the billion in total medicare indirect medical education payments made in ffy was empirically justified that is  related directly to the increased costs incurred by teaching hospitals to meet their teaching mission 
the medpac data also shows that only billion of the billion in total medicare disproportionate share hospital payments made in ffy reflected the additional costs for caring for low income patients 
at the january meeting  medpac approved recommendations to its march report to congress 
recommendations directly impacting hospitals are to provide a full inpatient and outpatient market basket update in ffy and to reduce the ime adjustments by to in ffy we cannot predict what actions  if any  congress or cms may take in this regard and what impact such actions may have on our operations 
such actions  if any  could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
ffy federal budget proposal on february   the white house released its ffy budget proposal  which includes nearly billion in medicare and medicaid cuts over five years 
the proposed cuts include annual medicare updates of market basket minus in ffys through for hospital inpatient and outpatient services  a ffy irf pps update of and market basket minus for ffys through  an update of medicare ambulatory surgical center payments of the consumer price index minus beginning in ffy  reduction of medicare ime and medicaid gme payments by more than billion over five years  mandatory reductions in medicare expenditures of if the medicare fund warning required by the deficit reduction act is triggered  reductions in irf pps payment rates for hip and knee replacement therapy  and a phase out of medicare bad debt payments over four years 
most of the budget proposals require congressional action  and we cannot predict what action  if any  congress will take 
as part of his state of the union address and with the release of the proposed budget  the president also announced two proposals to increase health insurance coverage 
the first proposal would provide a standard income tax deduction of  for individuals and  for families for the purchase of qualifying health insurance  and cap the income tax exclusion for employer provided health insurance at those same levels 
the second proposal  called the affordable choices initiative  seeks to expand the use of medicaid waivers  thereby allowing states to redirect disproportionate share hospital funds into new programs designed to expand health insurance coverage in low income populations 
these proposals have yet to be completely defined in detail and will require congressional action 
we cannot predict what actions  if any  congress will take and what impact such actions might have on our operations 
such actions  if any  could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
medicaid federal state financial partnership on january   cms released a display version of the proposed changes to the medicaid program under the federal state financial partnership 
under this proposed rule  cms would reduce medicaid funding to states by million per year for the ffys through the american hospital association is strongly urging congress to stop this rule and protect the medicaid program 
we cannot predict what actions  if any  congress or cms may take in this regard and what impact such actions may have on our operations 
such actions  if any  could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
private insurance managed care we currently have thousands of managed care contracts with various health maintenance organizations hmos and preferred provider organizations ppos 
hmos generally maintain a full service health care delivery network comprised of physician  hospital  pharmacy and ancillary service providers that hmo members must access through an assigned primary care physician 
the member s care is then managed by his or her primary care physician and other network providers in accordance with the hmo s quality assurance and utilization review guidelines so that appropriate health care can be efficiently delivered in the most cost effective manner 
hmos typically provide no benefit or reimbursement to their members who use non contracted health care providers 
ppos generally offer limited benefits to members who use non contracted health care providers 
ppo members who use contracted health care providers receive a preferred benefit  typically in the form of lower co payments or deductibles 
as employers and employees have demanded more choice  managed care plans have developed hybrid products that combine elements of both hmo and ppo plans 
the amount of our managed care net patient revenue during the years ended december   and was billion  billion and billion  respectively 
approximately of our managed care net patient revenues through december  were derived from our top ten managed care payers 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our net accounts receivable related to continuing operations were due from managed care payers 
the table below shows the managed care admissions by type for our general hospitals  expressed as percentages of total managed care admissions years ended december  non governmental governmental we expect managed care governmental admissions to continue to increase as a percentage of total managed care admissions 
however  the managed medicare and medicaid insurance plans typically generate lower yields than commercial managed care plans  which have been experiencing an improved pricing trend 
although we have had more than four consecutive quarters of improved managed care pricing  we expect some moderation in the pricing percentage increases  on a year over year basis  in the near to intermediate term due to the number of acquisitions in the managed care industry 
a majority of our managed care contracts are evergreen contracts 
evergreen contracts extend automatically every year  but may be renegotiated or terminated by either party after giving to days notice 
national payers generate approximately of our total net managed care revenues  although these agreements are often negotiated on a local or regional basis 
the remainder comes from regional or local payers 
indemnity an indemnity based agreement generally requires the insurer to reimburse an insured patient for health care expenses after those expenses have been incurred by the patient  subject to an increasing number of policy conditions and exclusions 
unlike an hmo member  a patient with indemnity insurance is free to control his or her utilization of health care and selection of health care providers 
self pay patients self pay patients are patients who do not qualify for government programs payments  such as medicare and medicaid  and who do not have some form of private insurance  and are  therefore  responsible for their own medical bills 
a significant portion of our self pay patients is being admitted through our hospitals emergency departments and often requires high acuity treatment 
high acuity treatment is more costly to provide and  therefore  results in higher billings  which are the least collectible of all accounts 
we believe our level of self pay patients has been higher in the last several years than previous periods due to a combination of broad economic factors  including reductions in state medicaid budgets  increasing numbers of individuals and employers who choose not to purchase insurance  and an increased burden of co payments and deductibles to be made by patients instead of insurers 
self pay accounts pose significant collectibility problems 
at both december  and  approximately of our net accounts receivable related to continuing operations were due from self pay patients 
further  the majority of our provision for doubtful accounts relates to self pay patients 
we are taking numerous actions in an effort to mitigate the effect on us of the high level of uninsured patients and the related economic impact 
these initiatives include conducting detailed reviews of existing intake procedures in our hospitals and creating better intake procedures for assisting patients with financial options 
we continue to modify and refine our self pay collection workflows  enhance our technology to assist our staff  and improve staff training in an effort to increase collections and reduce accounts receivable 
over the longer term  several other initiatives we have previously announced should also help address this challenge 
for example  our compact  which is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  is enabling us to offer lower rates to uninsured patients who historically have been charged standard gross charges 
we also provide charity care to patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive 
most patients who qualify for charity care are charged a per diem amount for services received  subject to a cap 
except for the per diem amounts  our policy is not to pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care  and  therefore  we do not report these amounts in net operating revenues or in provision for doubtful accounts 
for the years ended december   and  million  million and million in charity care gross charges were excluded from net operating revenues and provision for doubtful accounts  respectively 
results of operations the following two tables show a summary of our net operating revenues  operating expenses and operating loss from continuing operations  both in dollar amounts and as percentages of net operating revenues  for the years ended december   and years ended december  net operating revenues general hospitals other operations net operating revenues operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits supplies provision for doubtful accounts other operating expenses depreciation amortization impairment and restructuring charges  net of insurance recoveries hurricane insurance recoveries  net of costs costs of litigation and investigations loss from early extinguishment of debt operating loss years ended december  net operating revenues general hospitals other operations net operating revenues operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits supplies provision for doubtful accounts other operating expenses depreciation amortization impairment and restructuring charges  net of insurance recoveries hurricane insurance recoveries  net of costs costs of litigation and investigations loss from early extinguishment of debt operating loss net operating revenues of our continuing general hospitals include inpatient and outpatient revenues  as well as nonpatient revenues primarily rental income  management fee revenue and income from services such as cafeterias  gift shops and parking and other miscellaneous revenue 
net operating revenues of other operations consist primarily of revenues from physician practices  rehabilitation hospitals and a long term care facility located on or near the same campuses as our general hospitals and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates that are not directly associated with our general hospitals 
net operating revenues from our other operations were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates  included in our net operating revenues  were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
since  we have seen a decline in revenues from rehabilitation hospitals and long term care facilities in certain markets 
as we continue to focus on our general hospital operations  the revenue attributable to our other operations may continue to decrease 
the table below shows certain selected historical operating statistics for our continuing general hospitals years ended december  increase decrease dollars in millions  except per patient day  per admission and per visit amounts net inpatient revenues net outpatient revenues number of general hospitals at end of period licensed beds at end of period average licensed beds utilization of licensed beds patient days equivalent patient days net inpatient revenue per patient day admissions equivalent admissions net inpatient revenue per admission average length of stay days surgeries net outpatient revenue per visit outpatient visits net inpatient revenues and net outpatient revenues are components of net operating revenues 
net inpatient revenues at december   and included self pay revenues of million  million and million  respectively 
net outpatient revenues at december   and included self pay revenues of million  million and million  respectively 
the change is the difference between and amounts shown 
utilization of licensed beds represents patient days divided by average licensed beds divided by number of days in the period 
equivalent admissions patient days represents actual admissions patient days adjusted to include outpatient services by multiplying actual admissions patient days by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues and dividing the result by gross inpatient revenues 
self pay admissions represented  and of total admissions for the years ended december   and  respectively 
charity care admissions represented  and of total admissions for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenues during the year ended december   net operating revenues from continuing operations increased approximately million or compared to the year ended december  net operating revenues were also impacted by the discounts recorded on self pay accounts under our compact 
total compact discounts  which reduced net operating revenues  for the years ended december  and  were million and million  respectively 
outpatient visits  patient days and admissions were lower during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  by  and  respectively 
we believe the following factors continue to contribute to the overall decline in our inpatient and outpatient volume levels loss of patients to competing health care providers  challenges in physician recruitment  retention and attrition  strategic reduction of services related to our targeted growth initiative discussed in executive overview significant challenges company specific challenge above  and unfavorable publicity about us as a result of legacy lawsuits and government investigations  which has impacted our relationships with physicians and patients 
our net inpatient revenues for the year ended december  increased compared to the prior year 
there are various positive and negative factors impacting our net inpatient revenues 
the positive factors are as follows improved managed care pricing as a result of contracts renegotiated in and  partially offset by the reduction in stop loss payments from million in the prior year to million in the current year 
this improved pricing is also partially offset by an overall shift in our managed care patient mix towards plans with lower levels of reimbursement  including national payers whose contract terms typically generate lower yields  and managed care medicare and medicaid insurance plans  which typically generate lower yields than commercial managed care plans 
although we have had more than four consecutive quarters of improved managed care pricing  we expect some moderation in the pricing percentage increases in the near to intermediate term  and medicaid disproportionate share revenue of million in the current year  compared to million in the prior year 
the negative factors are as follows lower patient volumes  including medicare  medicaid and commercial managed care volumes  favorable net adjustments for prior year cost reports and related valuation allowances  primarily related to medicare and medicaid  in the current year of million  including a favorable adjustment of million in as a result of a change in estimate of the valuation allowances necessary for prior year cost report periods not yet audited and settled by our fiscal intermediary  versus a favorable net adjustment in the prior year of million  and compact discounts of million in the current year versus million in the prior year  which reduced net inpatient revenue 
net outpatient revenues during the year ended december  decreased compared to last year 
net outpatient revenues were also negatively impacted by the implementation of the compact 
during the year ended december   approximately million in discounts were recorded on outpatient self pay accounts under the compact compared to discounts of million during the year ended december  as previously mentioned  outpatient visits also decreased for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the primary reasons for this decrease are lower rehabilitation visits  closures or joint venture arrangements with respect to various outpatient centers  and the increasing competition we are experiencing from physician owned entities providing outpatient services 
the reduction in outpatient ancillary visits  coupled with an increase in emergency room visits and improved managed care pricing  contributed to an overall increase in our net outpatient revenue per visit 
salaries  wages and benefits salaries  wages and benefits expense as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased for the year ended december  compared to salaries  wages and benefits per adjusted patient day increased approximately in the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to less effective flexing of staff during volume declines  partially offset by lower overall benefit costs due primarily to favorable pension expense adjustments related to a terminated retirement plan of million in compared to million in approximately of our employees were represented by labor unions as of december  in september  certain employees of our placentia linda hospital voted to reject the service employees international union seiu as their collective bargaining representative  in june  certain employees of doctors medical center of modesto elected the california nurses association cna as their collective bargaining representative  and in december  certain employees of our usc university hospital  usc norris cancer center and community hospital of los gatos elected cna as their collective bargaining representative 
on december   our collective bargaining agreements with seiu and cna expired 
these agreements relate to multiple facilities in california and two hospitals in florida 
the terms of these expired collective bargaining agreements  which cover approximately of our employees  will remain in place until new agreements are reached 
we are currently negotiating with these unions  as well as with the united nurses association of california  regarding successor collective bargaining agreements 
although the new agreements are expected to have provisions to increase wages and benefits  the unions have agreed to an arbitration process to resolve any issues not resolved through normal renegotiations 
the agreed to arbitration process provides the greatest assurance that the unions will not engage in strike activity during the negotiation of new agreements and prevents the arbitrator from ordering us to pay market leading wages for a particular hospital 
we do not anticipate the new agreements will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
as union activity increases at our hospitals  our salaries  wages and benefits expense may increase more rapidly than our net operating revenues 
included in salaries  wages and benefits expense in the year ended december  is million of stock compensation expense compared to million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  the decrease from is due to the impact of fully vested restricted stock units and stock option grants that had a higher fair value estimate than recent grants 
supplies supplies expense as a percentage of net operating revenues remained flat for the year ended december  compared to  however  supplies expense per adjusted patient day increased from the increase in supplies expense was primarily attributable to higher pharmaceutical  orthopedic and implants supply costs 
in the case of implants  the higher costs are associated primarily with new products used to provide a higher quality of care to our patients  whereas the higher orthopedic costs primarily reflect inflation of prices 
higher pharmaceutical costs reflect a combination of new products and inflation 
we strive to control supplies expense through product standardization  bulk purchases  contract compliance  improved utilization  and operational improvements that should minimize waste 
the items of current cost reduction focus continue to be cardiac stents and pacemakers  orthopedic implants and high cost pharmaceuticals 
we also utilize the group purchasing strategies and supplies management services of broadlane  inc  a company in which we currently hold a interest 
broadlane offers a group purchasing procurement strategy  outsourcing and e commerce services to the health care industry 
provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased for the year ended december  compared to  primarily due to the implementation of the compact  partially offset by higher levels of uninsured patients 
prior to implementation of the discounting provisions under the compact  the vast majority of these accounts were ultimately recognized to be uncollectible and  as a result  were then recorded in our provision for doubtful accounts 
by offering managed care style discounts  we are charging the uninsured more affordable rates  whereby they may be better able to meet their financial obligations to pay for services we provide them 
the discounts recorded as contractual allowances during the year ended december  were approximately million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase is substantially due to the phasing in of the compact and the fact that compact discounts were in effect at all of our general hospitals in the year ended  whereas in  our hospitals in texas implemented the discounting components of the compact on september  and of our hospitals in california implemented them effective february  however  we do not expect the compact to have a material effect on the net economic impact of treating self pay patients 
a significant portion of our provision for doubtful accounts still relates to self pay patients 
collection of accounts receivable has been a key area of focus  particularly over the past two years  as we have experienced adverse changes in our business mix 
our current estimated collection rate on self pay accounts is approximately  including collections from point of service through collections by our in house collection agency or external collection vendors 
this self pay collection rate includes payments made by patients  including co payments and deductibles paid by patients with insurance  prior to an account being classified and assigned to our in house self pay collection group 
the self pay collection percentage as of december  was approximately 
we are taking numerous actions in an effort to mitigate the effect on us of the high level of uninsured patients and the related economic impact 
these initiatives include conducting detailed reviews of existing intake procedures in our hospitals and creating better intake procedures for assisting patients with financial options 
we continue to modify and refine our self pay collection workflows  enhance our technology to assist our staff  and improve staff training in an effort to increase collections and reduce accounts receivable 
payment pressure from managed care payers has also affected our provision for doubtful accounts 
we continue to experience ongoing managed care payment delays and disputes  however  we are working with these payers to obtain adequate and timely reimbursement for our services 
in the second quarter of  bad debt expense included a positive adjustment of approximately million to reduce bad debt expense for disputed managed care receivables that were ultimately settled 
as a result of these settlements  contractual allowances in included a corresponding increase that reduced net operating revenues by approximately million 
our current estimated collection rate on managed care accounts is approximately  which includes collections from point of service through collections by our in house collection agency or external collection vendors 
the comparable managed care collection percentage as of december  was approximately 
we continue to focus on revenue cycle initiatives to improve cash flow 
one specific initiative that was started during the quarter ended september  and is expected to be completed in is the center for patient access services  which is a centralized dedicated operation that performs financial clearance  including completing insurance eligibility checks  documenting verification of benefits  providing required notifications to managed care payers  obtaining pre authorizations when necessary and contacting the patient to offer pre service financial counseling 
although we continue to improve our methodology for evaluating the collectibility of our accounts receivable  we may incur future charges resulting from the above described trends 
we manage our provision for doubtful accounts using hospital specific goals and benchmarks such as total cash collections  point of service cash collections  accounts receivable days outstanding ar days and accounts receivable aging 
the following tables present the approximate aging by payer of our continuing operations net accounts receivable of billion and billion  excluding cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances of million and million  at december  and  respectively december  medicare medicaid managed care indemnity  self pay and other total days days days over days total december  medicare medicaid managed care indemnity  self pay and other total days days days over days total our ar days from continuing operations decreased to days at december  compared to days at december  ar days at december  and are within our target of below days 
this amount is calculated as our accounts receivable from continuing operations on that date divided by our revenue from continuing operations for the quarter ended on that date divided by the number of days in the quarter 
the decrease in ar days reflects improved collections  particularly in our texas and central northeast regions 
as of december   we had a cumulative total of patient account assignments dating back at least three years or older of approximately billion related to our continuing operations being pursued by our in house and outside collection agencies or vendors 
these accounts have already been written off and are not included in our receivables or in the allowance for doubtful accounts  however  an estimate of future recoveries from all the accounts in collection is determined based on our historical experience and recorded in accounts receivable 
patient advocates from our medical eligibility program mep screen patients in the hospital and determine potential linkage to financial assistance programs 
they also expedite the process of applying for these government programs 
receivables from patients who are potentially eligible for medicaid are classified as medicaid pending  under our mep  with appropriate contractual allowances recorded 
based on recent trends  approximately of all accounts in our mep are ultimately approved for benefits under a government program such as medicaid 
the following table shows the approximate amount of net accounts receivable in our mep  still awaiting determination of eligibility under a government program at december  and  by aging category december  days days days over days total includes accounts receivable of million at december  and million at december  that are fully reserved 
other operating expenses other operating expenses for the years ended december   and were  and of net operating revenue  respectively 
the increases are due primarily to increases in fixed costs that do not fluctuate with changes in our patient volumes  such as utilities  property taxes  information technology costs and other contracted services  including physicians fees  that continued to result in a higher operating expense percentage even though revenues increased from the prior year 
other operating expenses include malpractice expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decreases in and are due to lower volumes and improved loss development coupled with higher costs reflecting adverse loss development and a change in the maturity composite rate used to discount our malpractice liabilities from the federal reserve ten year composite rate to the federal reserve seven year composite rate  which resulted from a change in our claims payment patterns 
also included in other operating expenses in the year ended december  is million in net losses compared to million and million of net gains in the years ended december  and  respectively  on sales of equipment and other assets  including a net gain of approximately million in from the sale of certain home health agencies and hospices 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill and restructuring charges during the year ended december   we recorded impairment and restructuring charges of million  net of insurance recoveries of million 
this compares to impairment and restructuring charges of million and billion for the years ended december  and see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail of these charges  reversal of reserves and related liabilities 
in the second quarter of  we announced several changes to our operating structure 
because of the restructuring of our regions as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  our goodwill reporting units as defined in statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets changed in the second quarter of  requiring us to perform a goodwill impairment evaluation 
based on this evaluation  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million during the quarter ended june  based on the estimated fair value of goodwill associated with the reconfigured reporting units 
in addition  as part of our annual impairment test  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million for our central northeast region due to a lower estimated fair value as a result of adverse industry and company specific challenges that continue to affect our operating results and our anticipated future financial trends  including reduced patient volumes  high levels of bad debt expense related to uninsured and underinsured patients  and continued pressure on labor and supply costs 
we estimated the fair value of the goodwill based on independent appraisals  established market values of comparable assets  or internal estimates of future net cash flows 
our impairment tests presume stable or  in some cases  improving results in our hospitals 
if these expectations are not met  or if we expect negative trends to impact our future outlook  further impairments of long lived assets and goodwill may occur  and we will incur additional restructuring charges 
future restructuring of our regions that changes our goodwill reporting units could also result in further impairments of our goodwill 
costs of litigation and investigations costs of litigation and investigations in continuing operations for the year ended december  were million compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the expenses were comprised primarily of the june global civil settlement with the federal government million  accruals of minimum liabilities on several other cases  and legal and other costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the expenses consisted primarily of million for the net settlement of a securities lawsuit  million in final settlement of matters related to redding medical center  million to settle several issues with the florida attorney general  and legal and other costs to defend ourselves in other matters  in particular the various federal government investigations 
costs of litigation and investigations in continuing operations for the year ended december  consisted primarily of a million accrual for an estimated liability to address the potential resolution of a number of the civil lawsuits arising out of pricing strategies at facilities owned or formerly owned by our subsidiaries  and costs to defend ourselves in various matters 
loss from early extinguishment of debt in connection with the early redemption of senior notes in february  we recorded a million loss on extinguishment of debt  representing premiums paid and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs 
a loss on extinguishment of debt of million was recorded in in connection with the repurchase of senior notes and the termination of our credit agreement 
these losses primarily reflect the write off of debt issuance costs  discounts and unamortized hedging losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
net gains on sales of facilities and long term investments the million of net gains in the year ended december  related to the sale of an investment and the reduction of reserves associated with hospitals sold in prior years 
the million of net gains in the year ended december  related primarily to the reduction of reserve estimates associated with hospitals sold in prior years 
the million of net gains in the year ended december  related primarily to our sale of investments in various health care ventures and reduction of reserves associated with hospitals sold in prior years 
income tax expense benefit income taxes in the year ended december  included a million income tax benefit million recorded as a current income tax receivable and million as a non current deferred tax asset to record the tax effects of our global civil settlement with the federal government  the impact of the non deductibility of goodwill impairment charges million unfavorable tax impact on the effective tax rate reconciliation as a result of this permanent difference  income tax expense of million to increase the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets  excluding the impact of the rar discussed below and other tax adjustments  and an income tax benefit of million to reflect changes in our tax contingency reserves as a result of the rar and settlement discussed below and other tax adjustments  net of related valuation allowance 
in september  the irs completed its examination of our federal tax returns for fiscal years ended may  through the seven month transition period ended december  in october  the irs issued a revenue agent s report rar in which it proposed to assess an aggregate tax deficiency of million plus interest 
the rar addresses several disputed issues  including the computation of depreciation expense on certain capital expenditures  the deductibility of a portion of certain civil settlements we paid to the federal government and the deductibility of a loss incurred on the disposition of a business 
in the aggregate  the disputed issues comprise approximately million  plus interest thereon of million as of december  we believe our original deductions were appropriate  and we have appealed each of these disputed issues by filing a protest with the appeals division of the irs 
we believe we have adequately reserved for all probable tax matters presented in the rar  including interest 
we presently cannot determine the ultimate resolution of the disputed issues 
of the aggregate proposed tax deficiency of million  approximately million is attributable to issues that are not in dispute 
after taking into account net operating losses from  which offset a portion of the undisputed tax deficiency  the remaining undisputed amount is reduced to approximately million 
we paid this undisputed tax deficiency of million  plus interest thereon of million  in december income taxes in the year ended december  included income tax expense of million to increase the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets  and an income tax benefit of million to reflect changes in our tax contingency reserves 
we established a valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of as a result of assessing the realization of our deferred tax assets based on the fact that we incurred significant impairment charges  legal settlements and continued adverse results of operations  combined with having a cumulative loss for the three year period ended december   which is considered negative evidence under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
we concluded that  as a result of this negative evidence  sfas precludes us from relying upon our forecasts of future income for the purpose of supporting the realization of the deferred tax assets under the more likely than not standard 
income tax expense of million  on a pretax loss of billion  in the year ended december  included a portion of the impact of establishing the million valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of approximately million of the valuation allowance was recorded as income tax expense in continuing operations and million was recorded as income tax expense in discontinued operations 
also impacting income tax expense was the million unfavorable tax effect of the non deductibility of goodwill impairment charges 
pro forma information in light of the additional charges to provision for doubtful accounts recorded in the quarter ended june  related to the change in how we estimated the net realizable value of self pay accounts and the discounts for uninsured patients phased in under the compact  beginning in the second quarter of  we are supplementing certain historical information with information presented on a pro forma basis as if we had recorded no additional provision for doubtful accounts and had not implemented the discounts under the compact during the periods indicated 
this information includes numerical measures of our historical performance that have the effect of depicting such measures of financial performance differently from that presented in our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and that are defined under sec rules as non gaap financial measures 
we believe that the information presented on this pro forma basis is important to our shareholders in order to show the effect that these items had on elements of our historical results of operations and provide important insight into our operations in terms of other underlying business trends  without necessarily estimating or suggesting their effect on our future results of operations 
this supplemental information has inherent limitations because the additional provision for doubtful accounts recorded during the quarter ended june  and discounts under the compact during the periods presented are not indicative of future periods 
we compensate for these inherent limitations by also utilizing comparable gaap measures 
in spite of the limitations  we find the supplemental information useful to the extent it better enables us and our investors to evaluate bad debt trends and other expenses  and we believe the consistent use of this supplemental information provides us and our investors with reliable period to period comparisons 
costs in our business are largely influenced by volumes and  thus  are generally analyzed as a percent of net operating revenues 
accordingly  we provide this additional analytical information to better enable investors to measure expense categories between periods 
based on requests by shareholders and analysts  we believe that these non gaap measures are useful as well 
the tables that follow illustrate certain actual operating expenses as a percent of net operating revenues  net inpatient revenue per admission and net outpatient revenue per visit for the years ended december   and as if we had recorded no additional provision for doubtful accounts in the second quarter of and had not implemented the discounts under the compact during the periods indicated 
the tables include reconciliations of gaap measures to non gaap measures 
investors are encouraged  however  to use gaap measures when evaluating our financial performance

liquidity and capital resources cash requirements our obligations to make future cash payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments  such as standby letters of credit and minimum revenue guarantees  are summarized in the table below  all as of december  years ending december  later total years in millions long term debt global civil settlement payable capital lease obligations long term non cancelable operating leases standby letters of credit guarantees asset retirement obligations tax liabilities supplemental executive retirement plan obligations information technology contract services purchase orders total includes interest through maturity date lease termination 
includes minimum revenue guarantees  primarily related to physicians under relocation agreements and physician groups that provide services at our hospitals  and operating lease guarantees 
the standby letters of credit are required principally by our insurers and various states to collateralize our workers compensation programs pursuant to statutory requirements and as security to collateralize the deductible and self insured retentions under some of our professional and general liability insurance programs 
the amount of collateral required is principally dependent upon the level of claims activity and our creditworthiness 
the insurers require the collateral in case we are unable to meet our obligations to claimants within the deductible or self insured retention layers 
the standby letters of credit are issued under our revolving credit facility 
our capital expenditures primarily relate to the expansion and renovation of existing facilities  including amounts to comply with applicable laws and regulations  equipment and information systems additions and replacements  introduction of new medical technologies  design and construction of new buildings and various other capital improvements 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures for the year ending december  will total approximately million 
this amount includes expenditures for certain equipment identified in connection with our assessment of physician and hospital needs that were not purchased in the anticipated capital expenditures also include approximately million in to meet california seismic requirements for our remaining california facilities after all planned divestitures 
the total estimated future value of capital expenditures necessary to meet the seismic requirements through is approximately million  which was estimated using an inflation rate of approximately 
our budgeted capital expenditures for the year ended december  also include approximately million to improve disability access at certain of our facilities  as a result of a consent decree in a class action lawsuit 
we expect to spend a total of approximately million on such improvements over the next five years 
interest payments  net of capitalized interest  were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate that our gross interest payments  including capitalized interest  for the year ending december  will be approximately million 
income tax payments  net of refunds received  were approximately million in the year ended december  compared to a net income tax refund of million in the year ended december  at december   our carryforwards available to offset future taxable income consisted of federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately billion expiring in to  approximately million in alternative minimum tax credits with no expiration  and general business credit carryforwards of approximately million expiring in to sources and uses of cash our liquidity for the year ended december  was derived primarily from sales of facilities  cash on hand  the release of million of restricted cash in connection with our prior letter of credit agreement and insurance recoveries 
during  our liquidity was derived primarily from proceeds from the sale of new senior notes  cash flows from operating activities  including a million income tax refund  sales of facilities and unrestricted cash on hand 
for the year ended december   our liquidity was derived primarily from sales of facilities and unrestricted cash on hand 
our primary source of operating cash is the collection of accounts receivable 
as we experience changes in our business mix and as admissions of uninsured patients grow  our operating cash flow is negatively impacted due to lower levels of cash collections and higher levels of bad debt 
during the year ended december   cash used in operating activities was million 
the decrease from the prior year in cash generated by operations  after considering the income tax refund in  is due primarily to higher payments for litigation settlements and taxes  partially offset by insurance recoveries 
during the year ended december   we had cash provided by operating activities of million 
the primary contributor was the income tax refund of million 
in addition  lower payments for restructuring and litigation settlements and reduced operating cash requirements related to discontinued operations contributed to the increase from the prior year 
during the year ended december   we had cash used by our operating activities of million 
the primary contributors were payments made for unfavorable litigation settlements and payments made against reserves for restructuring charges  which approximated million in total  and higher operating cash requirements related to discontinued operations  including a million payment to settle patient litigation related to alleged medically unnecessary coronary procedures performed at our former redding medical center 
net cash proceeds from the sale of new senior notes were million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
we used the proceeds to redeem other long term debt  to retire existing bank loans under our credit agreements at the time and for general corporate purposes 
proceeds from the sales of facilities  long term investments and other assets during  and aggregated million  million and million  respectively 
during  million was released from an escrow account to fund construction costs 
as of december   there was no balance remaining in the escrow account 
we have not made any repurchases of our common stock since june  and do not intend to repurchase any shares in we have issued shares to be held by our benefit plan administrator that are reported as treasury shares until released to our employees as a result of restricted stock unit grants  which entitle employees to receive shares of our common stock in the future 
debt instruments  guarantees and related covenants in november  we entered into a five year  million senior secured revolving credit facility that replaced our million letter of credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is collateralized by patient accounts receivable at our acute care and specialty hospitals  and bears interest at our option based on the london interbank offered rate plus basis points or citigroup s base rate  as defined in the credit agreement  plus basis points 
after six months from the start of the credit agreement  the interest spread over the london interbank offered rate and citigroup s base rate may be reduced by basis points if our leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement  is below the defined threshold 
the revolving credit agreement includes a provision  which we believe is customary in receivables backed credit facilities  that gives our banks the right to require that proceeds of collections of substantially all of our consolidated accounts receivable be applied directly to repay outstanding loans and other amounts that are due and payable under the revolving credit facility at any time that unused borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility is less than million or if an event of default has occurred and is continuing thereunder 
in that event  we would seek to re borrow under the revolving credit facility to satisfy our operating cash requirements 
our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility is subject to conditions precedent that are customary in such facilities  including that no default then exists 
the letters of credit outstanding under our previous letter of credit facility were transferred into the revolving credit facility  which reduced the amount available for cash borrowings  but eliminated the restriction on million of cash pledged under the letter of credit facility 
at december   there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
in january  we sold million of senior notes due in in february  with a portion of the net proceeds from that sale  we redeemed the remaining million aggregate principal amount outstanding on our senior notes due in and as a result  we have no significant long term debt due until december the maturities of over of our long term debt now fall between december and january an additional million of long term debt is not due until in june  we sold billion of senior notes due in a portion of the proceeds was used to repurchase million of senior notes due in  and on december   we terminated our previous five year revolving credit agreement and replaced it with a one year letter of credit facility 
the letter of credit facility provided for the issuance of up to million in letters of credit and did not provide for any cash borrowings 
the principal purpose of the letter of credit facility was to provide for the continuance of million in letters of credit outstanding under the terminated revolving credit agreement at that time 
from time to time  we expect to engage in various capital markets  bank credit and other financing activities depending on our needs and financing alternatives available at that time 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants and conditions in our revolving credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes 
at december   we had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and borrowing capacity of million under our revolving credit facility at december  to fund our operations and capital expenditures 
liquidity we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents on hand  availability under our revolving credit facility  future cash provided by operating activities  collection of income taxes receivable and sales proceeds from our hospitals held for sale should be adequate to meet our current cash needs 
it should also be adequate to finance planned capital expenditures  payments on the current portion of our long term debt and other presently known operating needs 
long term liquidity for debt service will be dependent on improved cash provided by operating activities and  given favorable market conditions  future borrowings or refinancings 
however  our cash needs could be materially affected by the deterioration in our results of operations  as well as the various uncertainties discussed in this and other sections  which could require us to pursue any number of financing options  including  but not limited to  additional borrowings  debt refinancings  asset sales or other financing alternatives 
the level  if any  of these financing sources cannot be assured 
we are aggressively identifying and implementing further actions to reduce costs and enhance our operating performance  including cash flow 
among the areas being addressed are volume growth  managed care payer contracting  procurement efficiencies  cost standardization  bad debt expense reduction initiatives  underperforming hospitals and certain hospital and overhead costs not related to patient care 
although these initiatives may result in improved performance  that performance may remain somewhat below our hospital management peers because of geographic and other differences in hospital portfolios 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that may have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources  except for million of standby letters of credit and guarantees as of december  shown in the cash requirements table above 
recently issued accounting standards see note of our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards 
critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap  we must use estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use 
in general  we base the estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  given the particular circumstances in which we operate 
actual results may vary from those estimates 
we consider our critical accounting estimates to be those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties  require estimates that are more difficult for management to determine  and may produce materially different outcomes under different conditions or when using different assumptions 
our critical accounting estimates cover the following areas recognition of net operating revenues  including contractual allowances provisions for doubtful accounts accruals for general and professional liability risks accruals for supplemental executive retirement plans accruals for litigation losses impairment of long lived assets and goodwill asset retirement obligations accounting for income taxes accounting for stock based compensation revenue recognition we recognize net operating revenues in the period in which services are performed 
net operating revenues consist primarily of net patient service revenues that are recorded based on established billing rates ie  gross charges  less estimated discounts for contractual and other allowances  principally for patients covered by medicare  medicaid and managed care and other health plans and uninsured patients under the compact 
revenues under the traditional fee for service medicare and medicaid programs are based primarily on prospective payment systems 
discounts for retrospectively cost based revenues  which were more prevalent in earlier periods  and certain other payments  such as disproportionate share  gme  ime and bad debt expense  which are based on our hospitals cost reports  are estimated using historical trends and current factors 
cost report settlements under these programs are subject to audit by medicare and medicaid auditors and administrative and judicial review  and it can take several years until final settlement of such matters are determined and completely resolved 
because the laws  regulations  instructions and rule interpretations governing medicare and medicaid reimbursement are complex and change frequently  the estimates recorded by us could change by material amounts 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed the implementation of a new system and estimation process for recording medicare net patient revenue and estimated cost report settlements 
this resulted in recording accruals to more closely reflect the expected final settlements on our cost reports 
for filed cost reports  we record the accrual based on those cost reports and subsequent activity  and record a valuation allowance against those cost reports based on historical settlement trends 
the accrual for periods for which a cost report is yet to be filed is recorded based on estimates of what we expect to report on the filed cost reports  and a corresponding valuation allowance is recorded as previously described 
cost reports must be filed generally within five months after the end of the annual cost report reporting period 
after the cost report is filed  the accrual and corresponding valuation allowance may need to be adjusted 
revenues under managed care plans are based primarily on payment terms involving predetermined rates per diagnosis  per diem rates  discounted fee for service rates and or other similar contractual arrangements 
these revenues are also subject to review and possible audit by the payers 
the payers are billed for patient services on an individual patient basis 
an individual patient s bill is subject to adjustment on a patient by patient basis in the ordinary course of business by the payers following their review and adjudication of each particular bill 
we estimate the discounts for contractual allowances at the individual hospital level utilizing billing data on an individual patient basis 
at the end of each month  on an individual hospital basis  we attempt to estimate our expected reimbursement for patients of managed care plans based on the applicable contract terms 
these estimates are continuously reviewed for accuracy by taking into consideration known contract terms as well as payment history 
although we do not separately accumulate and disclose the aggregate amount of adjustments to the estimated reimbursements for every patient bill  we believe our estimation and review process enables us to identify instances on a timely basis where such estimates need to be revised 
we do not believe there were any adjustments to estimates of individual patient bills that were material to our revenues 
in addition  on a corporate wide basis  we do not record any general provision for adjustments to estimated contractual allowances for managed care plans 
revenues related to self pay patients may qualify for a discount under the compact  whereby the gross charges based on established billing rates would be reduced by an estimated discount for contractual allowance 
we believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from final determination of amounts earned under all the above arrangements 
we know of no material claims  disputes or unsettled matters with any payers that would affect our revenues for which we have not adequately provided for in our consolidated financial statements 
provisions for doubtful accounts although outcomes vary  our policy is to attempt to collect amounts due from patients  including co payments and deductibles due from patients with insurance  at the time of service while complying with all federal and state laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  the emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala 
generally  as required by emtala  patients may not be denied emergency treatment due to inability to pay 
therefore  services  including the legally required medical screening examination and stabilization of the patient  are performed prior to the verification of the patient s insurance  if any 
in non emergency circumstances or for elective procedures and services  it is our policy to verify insurance prior to a patient being treated 
we provide for an allowance against accounts receivable that could become uncollectible by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
we estimate this allowance based on the aging of our accounts receivables by hospital  our historical collection experience by hospital and for each type of payer  and other relevant factors 
our practice is to reduce the net carrying value of self pay accounts receivable  including accounts related to the co payments and deductibles due from patients with insurance  to their estimated net realizable value at the time of billing 
generally  uncollected balances are assigned to our in house collection agency between to days  once patient responsibility has been identified 
when accounts are assigned for collections by the hospital  the accounts are completely written off the hospital s books through the provision for doubtful accounts  and an estimated future recovery amount is calculated and recorded as a receivable on the hospital s books at the same time 
the estimated future recovery amount is adjusted based on the aging of the accounts and changes to actual recovery rates 
the estimated future recovery amount for self pay accounts is gradually written down whereby it is fully reserved if the amount is not paid within two years after the account is assigned to our in house collection agency 
managed care accounts are collected through our hospital based business offices or regional business offices  whereby the account balances remain in the hospital s patient accounting system and on the hospital s books  and are adjusted based on an analysis of the net realizable value as they age 
managed care accounts collected through our hospital based business offices or regional business offices are gradually written down whereby they are fully reserved if the accounts are not paid within one year 
changes in the collectibility of aged managed care accounts receivable are ongoing and impact our provision for doubtful accounts 
we continue to experience payment pressure from managed care companies concerning amounts of past billings 
we aggressively pursue collection of these accounts receivable using all means at our disposal  including arbitration and litigation  but we may not be successful 
accruals for general and professional liability risks we accrue for estimated professional and general liability claims  to the extent not covered by insurance  when they are probable and reasonably estimable 
we maintain reserves  which are based on actuarial estimates by an independent third party  for the portion of our professional liability risks  including incurred but not reported claims  to the extent we do not have insurance coverage 
our estimated liability is based on a number of factors  including the number of asserted claims and reported incidents  estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts  estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience  the timing of historical payments and risk free discount rates used to determine the present value of future cash flows 
our estimated reserve for professional and general liability claims will change significantly if future claims differ from historical trends 
in addition  because of the complexity of the claims  the extended period of time to settle the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes  our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates 
accruals for supplemental executive retirement plans our supplemental executive retirement plan benefit obligations are calculated using actuarial concepts  within the framework of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans 
that statement requires the recognition of the funded status of the plan projected benefit obligation net of the fair value of plan assets as an asset or liability on the balance sheet with changes in the funded status recognized as an increase or decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the discount rate is a critical assumption in determining the elements of expense and liability measurement 
we evaluate this critical assumption annually 
other assumptions include employee demographic factors  such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover and rate of compensation increase 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for these benefits as a present value on the measurement date 
the guideline for setting this rate is a high quality  long term corporate bond rate 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
we increased our discount rate to in from in to reflect market interest rate conditions at our december  measurement date 
the assumed discount rate for pension plans reflects the market rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total net periodic pension expense for fiscal by million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at december  by million 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would increase total net periodic pension expense and decrease the projected benefit obligation at december  by million and million  respectively 
accruals for litigation losses we record reserves for litigation losses in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas 
under sfas  a loss contingency is recorded if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
we record probable loss contingencies based on the best estimate of the loss 
if a range of loss can be reasonably estimated  but no single amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range  the minimum amount in the range is accrued 
these estimates are often initially developed earlier than when the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are adjusted if additional information becomes known 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for possible impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset  or related group of assets  may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
we calculate the amount of an impairment  if the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the fair value of the assets is estimated based on independent appraisals  established market values of comparable assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows expected to result from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset 
the estimates of these future cash flows are based on assumptions and projections we believe to be reasonable and supportable 
they require our subjective judgments and take into account assumptions about revenue and expense growth rates 
these assumptions may vary by type of facility and presume stable or improving results at our hospitals  depending on their circumstances 
if the presumed level of performance does not occur as expected  impairment may result 
we report long lived assets to be disposed of at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair values less costs to sell 
in such circumstances  our estimates of fair value are based on independent appraisals  established market prices for comparable assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows 
these fair value estimates can change by material amounts in subsequent periods 
many factors and assumptions can impact the estimates  including the future financial results of our hospitals  how the hospitals are operated in the future  changes in health care industry trends and regulations  and the nature of the ultimate disposition of the assets 
in certain cases  these fair value estimates assume the highest and best use of the assets in the future to a market place participant is other than as a hospital 
in these cases  the estimates are based on the fair value of the real property and equipment if utilized other than as a hospital 
the impairment recognized does not include the costs of closing the hospital or other future operating costs  which could be substantial 
accordingly  the ultimate net cash realized from the hospital  should we choose to sell it  could be significantly less than its impaired value 
impairment of goodwill goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations and determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but instead are subject to impairment tests performed at least annually 
for goodwill  we perform the test at the reporting unit level  as defined by appropriate accounting standards  when events occur that require an evaluation to be performed or at least annually 
if we determine the carrying value of goodwill is impaired  or if the carrying value of a business that is to be sold or otherwise disposed of exceeds its fair value  then we reduce the carrying value  including any allocated goodwill  to fair value 
estimates of fair value are based on independent appraisals  established market prices for comparative assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows and presume stable or improving results at our hospitals  depending on their circumstances 
if the presumed level of performance does not occur as expected  impairment may result 
asset retirement obligations we recognize the fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with asset retirements in the period in which it is incurred  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas and financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  if a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the obligation can be made 
when the liability is initially recorded  we capitalize the cost of the asset retirement obligation by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost associated with the retirement obligation is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the obligation  any difference between the cost to settle the asset retirement obligation and the liability recorded is recognized as a gain or loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
the calculation of the asset retirement obligation is a critical accounting estimate because factors used in calculating the obligation can change  which could result in larger or smaller estimated obligations that could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
the significant assumptions and estimates used in the calculation include the following estimated settlement date of the obligation the year when the asset is no longer deemed to have any future useful life  and the facility or asset is closed  or otherwise disposed of  is when final settlement of the obligation is estimated to occur  and is generally based on the remaining years of useful life of our facilities or the expiration of a lease 
changes in demand  competing facilities  economic conditions  technology advancements  state regulations and availability of physicians  nurses and staff can affect the estimated settlement date 
retirement obligation costs estimated based on our knowledge of the applicable laws and regulations  known facts and circumstances of specific obligations  and cost estimates obtained from industry consultants or our knowledge and past experience 
asbestos presence the estimated amount of asbestos in our facilities was determined by our construction staff and  in certain cases  external environmental specialist site visits based on their knowledge of the architectural state of the facility  the age of the facility and whether any renovation had recently occurred 
due to facilities changing ownership several times and our experience during renovations of inconsistent use of building materials  it cannot be known with certainty the exact amount of asbestos present or the exact location of all asbestos that may need to be remediated 
inflation rate the inflation rate applied to current remediation costs is used to estimate the future value of the remediation costs at the time the retirement obligation is estimated to be settled 
we have assumed an inflation rate of based on the nature of the retirement obligations 
discount rate the estimated costs at the anticipated settlement date are discounted back to the year the asset was built or acquired to determine the amount of the obligation when it was incurred 
the estimate of the initial obligation has been accreted to the current date in accordance with sfas the discount rate represents our credit adjusted  risk free rate of interest  which is estimated to be 
using these estimates and assumptions  the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  fixed asset cost  accumulated depreciation and the asset retirement obligation were calculated for each of our facilities that have known asset retirement obligations 
subsequent changes to these assumptions will affect future depreciation and accretion expense 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
developing our provision for income taxes and analysis of potential tax exposure items requires significant judgment and knowledge of federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we assess the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on all available evidence  both positive and negative  and the weight of that evidence to the extent such evidence can be objectively verified  we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the main factors that we consider include cumulative losses in recent years  income losses expected in future years  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect future operations and profit levels  the availability  or lack thereof  of taxable income in prior carryback periods that would limit realization of tax benefits  the carryforward period associated with the deferred tax assets and liabilities  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax receivables or liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by taxing authorities or changes in tax laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
accounting for stock based compensation effective january   we account for the cost of stock based compensation using the fair value method required by sfas no 
r  share based payments sfas r  under which the cost of stock option grants and other incentive awards to employees  directors  advisors and consultants generally is measured by the fair value of the awards on their grant date and is recognized over the vesting periods of the awards  whether or not the awards had any intrinsic value during the period 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for the cost of stock based compensation using the fair value method recommended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
under sfas r  we estimate the fair value of stock option grants as of the date of each grant  using a binomial lattice model 
the key assumptions of the binomial lattice model include expected volatility expected dividend yields expected life expected forfeiture rate risk free interest rate range early exercise threshold early exercise rate the expected volatility used in the binomial lattice model incorporates historical and implied share price volatility and is based on an analysis of historical prices of our stock and open market exchanged options  and was developed in consultation with an outside valuation specialist 
the expected volatility reflects the historical volatility for a duration consistent with the contractual life of the options  and the volatility implied by the trading of options to purchase our stock on open market exchanges 
the historical share price volatility excludes the movements in our stock price during the period october  through december  due to the extreme volatility of our stock price during this time period 
the expected life of options granted is derived from the output of the binomial lattice model  and represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding for the distinct group of employees 
this model incorporates an early exercise assumption in the event of a significant increase in stock price 
the risk free interest rates are based on zero coupon united states treasury yields in effect at the date of grant consistent with the expected exercise timeframes 
under sfas  we estimated the fair value of stock option grants as of the date of each grant  using a black scholes option pricing model 
this model incorporates our reasoned assumptions regarding the expected volatility of our common stock price  estimated risk free interest rates  and the expected dividend yield  if any  all over the expected lives of the respective options 
we do not adjust the model for non transferability  risk of forfeiture or the vesting restrictions of the option all of which would reduce the option value if factored into our calculations 
the most critical of the above assumptions in our calculations of fair value is the expected life of an option  because it  in turn  is a principal part of our calculations of expected volatility and interest rates 
accordingly  we reevaluate our estimate of expected life at each major grant date 
our reevaluation is based on recent exercise patterns and is reviewed from time to time by an outside  independent consulting firm 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the table below presents information about certain of our market sensitive financial instruments as of december  the fair values were determined based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments
