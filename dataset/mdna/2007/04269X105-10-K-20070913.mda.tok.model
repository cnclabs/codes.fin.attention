the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview array biopharma inc is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of targeted small molecule drugs to treat debilitating and life threatening diseases 
our proprietary drug development pipeline is focused on the treatment of cancer and inflammatory disease and includes clinical candidates that are designed to regulate therapeutically important target proteins 
we currently have programs in our development pipeline  eight of which are wholly owned by us 
our eight most advanced development programs that we wholly own and control consist of arry  an erbb egfr dual inhibitor for cancer  arry  a mek inhibitor for inflammation  arry  a p inhibitor for inflammation and for cancer  arry  a ksp inhibitor for cancer  arry  an erbb inhibitor for cancer  and arry  a p and tie dual inhibitor for inflammation and for cancer 
in addition  we have out licensed to astrazeneca plc three mek inhibitors for cancer including arry azd  currently in multiple phase clinical trials  and arry azd  currently in a phase clinical trial 
the out license and collaboration agreements with these collaborators provide for up front payments  research funding  success based milestone payments and royalties on product sales 
through collaborations we have also invented drug candidates that are currently in clinical development  including one for intermune  inc hcv ns protease inhibitor  itmn  and one for eli lilly and company icos corporation  ic  a chk inhibitor 
in addition to these development programs  we have out licensed two cancer programs to genentech and we have a portfolio of discovery programs that we believe will generate two to three investigational new drug  or ind  applications per year over the next three years 
our discovery efforts have also generated additional early stage drug candidates that we may choose to out license through research partnerships 
we have evolved our research collaboration strategy to include seeking opportunities to out license early stage drug candidates that do not meet our development criteria 
we believe this strategy will result in our receiving a greater portion of the potential financial upside than our previous research collaborations 
a recent example of this is our collaboration with ventirx pharmaceuticals  inc  which is described above under partnered research and development 
we also believe this strategy will allow us to maximize our scientific efforts and other resources on programs for which we have particular expertise or which have synergies with our other development programs 
we have created our proprietary pipeline of development and discovery programs on a modest investment of approximately million in research and development expenses from our inception through june  additionally  we have recognized a total of million in research funding and in up front and milestone payments from our collaboration partners through june  under our existing collaboration agreements  we have the potential to earn over million in additional milestone payments if we achieve all of the drug discovery objectives detailed in these agreements  as well as royalties on any resulting product sales from different drug development programs 
business development we currently license certain of our compounds and or programs and enter into collaborations directly with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies through opportunities identified by our business development group  senior management  scientists and customer referrals 
in addition  we license our compounds and enter into collaborations in japan through an agent 
our top collaborators contributed approximately of our total revenue during fiscal  and our current top four collaborators  genentech  intermune  astrazeneca and ono accounted for   and  respectively  of our total revenue 
during fiscal year genentech  intermune  astrazeneca and ono accounted for   and  respectively  of our total revenue 
in general  certain of our collaborators may terminate their collaboration agreements with us on to days prior notice  including our agreement with genentech which can be terminated on days notice 
international revenue represented of our total revenue during fiscal years and our international revenue is primarily attributable to european and japanese collaborations 
international revenue remained constant as a proportion of total revenues during fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to full recognition of two milestone payments from astrazeneca in the current fiscal year totaling million for advancing arry into phase clinical trials and for the advancement of arry into phase clinical trials 
this amount compares to revenues from the research funded portion of the same agreement with astrazeneca which expired during fiscal all of our collaboration agreements are denominated in united states dollars 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur losses in the near future as we continue to invest in our proprietary drug discovery programs 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
critical accounting policies our financial statements and related notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities and other items that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes that prove different from those upon which we based our assumptions 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the following critical accounting policies have the most significant impact on the estimates and judgments used when preparing our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition most of our revenue is derived from designing  creating  optimizing  evaluating and developing drug candidates for our collaborators 
our agreements with our collaboration partners include fees based on contracted annual rates for full time equivalent employees working on a project  and may also include non refundable license and up front fees  non refundable milestone payments that are triggered upon achievement of specific research or development goals  and future royalties on sales of products that result from the collaboration 
a small portion of our revenue comes from fixed fee agreements or from sales of compounds on a per compound basis 
we report revenue for lead generation and lead optimization research  custom synthesis and process research  the development and sale of chemical compounds and the co development of proprietary drug candidates we out license  as collaboration revenue 
license and milestone revenue is combined and reported separately from collaboration revenue 
arrangements that include multiple elements are evaluated under emerging issues task force no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to determine whether the element has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and whether reliable evidence of fair value for the delivered and undelivered elements exists 
deliverables in an arrangement that do not meet the separation criteria of eitf are treated as a single unit of accounting  generally applying applicable revenue recognition guidance for the final deliverable to the combined unit of accounting as defined in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
sab in turn established four criteria  each of which must be met  in order to recognize revenue related to the performance of services or the shipment of products 
revenue is recognized when a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b products are delivered or services are rendered  c the sales price is fixed or determinable and d collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue from non refundable up front payments and license fees on a straight line basis over the term of performance under the agreement  which is generally the research term specified in the agreement 
these advance payments are deferred and recorded as advance payments from collaborators upon receipt  pending recognition  and are classified as a short term or long term liability on our balance sheet 
when the performance period is not specifically identifiable from the agreement  we estimate the performance period based upon provisions contained within the agreement  such as the duration of the research term  the specific level number of full time equivalent scientists working a defined number of hours per year at a stated price under the agreement  the existence or likelihood of development commitments  and other significant commitments of the company 
we determined that the performance periods applicable to our agreements with astrazenca and genentech were both for two years  which ended in november  and we determined the performance period for our agreement with ventirx to be one year ending in march each of these periods coincides with the research terms specified in each agreement 
we periodically review the expected performance periods under each of our agreements that provide for non refundable up front payments and license fees 
to date  there has not been a significant change in an estimate or assumption of the expected period of performance that has had a material effect on the timing or amount of revenue recognized 
similarly to advance payments  for agreements that provide for milestone payments  a portion of each milestone payment is recognized as revenue when the specific milestone is achieved based on the applicable percentage of the estimated research term that has elapsed to the total estimated research term 
revenue recognition related to non refundable license fees and up front payments and to milestone payments could be accelerated in the event of early termination of programs 
in february  we entered into a collaboration and licensing agreement in which we received a non refundable cash technology access fee and shares of preferred stock valued at million based on the price at which such preferred stock was sold to investors in a private offering 
both the technology access fee and the value of the preferred stock were recorded as advance payments from collaborators and deferred revenue  and are being recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated one year research term 
the preferred stock value has been recorded as a long term asset 
revenue from sales of compounds in our lead generation library and optimer building blocks is generally recognized as the compounds are shipped 
we recognize revenue based on contracted annual rates for full time equivalent employees working on a project on a monthly basis as work is performed 
preclinical study and clinical trial accruals substantial portions of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials have been performed by third party medical centers or contract research organizations which we refer to collectively as cros 
some cros bill monthly for services performed  while others bill based upon milestone achievement 
we accrue expenses each month for agreements involving significant costs and that bill based on milestone achievement 
for preclinical studies  accruals are based upon the estimated percentage of work completed and the contract milestones remaining 
for costs for clinical study activities performed by cros  accruals are estimated based upon the estimated work completed on each study  and for clinical trial expenses  accruals are based upon the number of patients enrolled and the expected duration of the study for which they will be enrolled 
we monitor patient enrollment and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence with the cros  clinical site visits  and review of contractual terms 
our estimates are highly dependant upon the timeliness and accuracy of the data provided by its cros regarding the status of each program and total program spending 
we periodically evaluate our estimates to determine if adjustments are necessary or appropriate based on information we receive concerning changing circumstances  conditions or events that may affect such estimates 
no material adjustments to preclinical study and clinical trial expenses have been recognized to date 
investments in marketable securities our short term investments in marketable securities are comprised of us treasury  government or agency obligations  state and municipal obligations and domestic public corporate debt securities 
investments are classified as short term or long term based on their original or remaining maturities and whether the securities represent the investment of funds available for current operations 
all of our investments are held in our name at two major us financial institutions 
at june  and  all of our investments were classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices at the end of each reporting period 
unrealized gains or losses are recorded as a separate component of cumulative other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
if these investments are sold at a loss or are considered to have experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary  a charge to operations is recorded 
the specific identification method is used to determine the cost of securities disposed of  with realized gains and losses reflected in interest income  net 
leasehold improvements we amortize leasehold improvements for our boulder and longmont facilities over the shorter of their estimated economic useful lives or the related lease terms 
we determined the lease terms to be the original  fixed  non cancelable ten year lease terms 
this period does not include the optional lease extension periods available to us under the lease agreements because we have determined that the exercise of these options is not reasonably assured 
consequently  the leasehold improvements for our facilities are amortized over the original ten year lease term as it is shorter than the remaining estimated useful life of the improvements 
we periodically reassess the expected remaining useful lives of our leased facilities to determine whether the amortization period remains consistent with current expectations and plans  and if there is any change  we will make appropriate adjustments to the estimated lease terms and disclosures 
deferred rent during july and august  we terminated our existing facility leases and executed new lease agreements with a different landlord 
accordingly  the entire june  deferred rent balance of million was reversed and recorded as a reduction to our recognized rent expense for the first quarter of fiscal additionally  in conjunction with the assignment of facility purchase options as described in note operating leases to our audited financial statements included in this annual report  we received net proceeds of million which was recorded as deferred rent and is being recognized on a straight line basis as a reduction to rent expense over the related ten year term of each of the new facilities leases 
the current facilities leases provide for annual rent increases  and we recognize the average annual rent expense over the term of these leases on a straight line basis 
the current portion of the deferred rent balance reflected on our balance sheet represents the amount of expected deferred rent credits to be applied as a reduction to our rent expense over the next twelve month period 
share based compensation on july   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r  requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense based on estimated fair values for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including stock options and purchases of common stock by employees at a discount to market price under our employee stock purchase plan or the espp 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r was million and million  representing a loss of and per basic and diluted share  for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
for the year ended june   prior to the adoption of fas r  stock compensation expense of  was recognized 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method of adoption of sfas r that we elected  comparative results for the fiscal year have not been restated and therefore are not comparable to the results for fiscal years and see note accounting for share based compensation and note stock compensation plans for additional information 
the estimated fair value of stock options is expensed on a straight line basis over the expected term of the option 
compensation expense for purchases under the espp is recognized based on the estimated fair value of the common stock during each offering period and the percentage of the purchase discount 
upon adoption of sfas r  we began to estimate the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant  and the fair value of our common stock during each offering period under the espp  using a black scholes model 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the fair value of each stock option was estimated on the grant date using a black scholes model in order to provide the pro forma financial disclosure information in accordance with sfas the determination of fair value for share based payment awards using an option pricing model is highly judgmental and affected by our stock price as well as assumptions and estimates concerning other highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables and estimates include  but are not limited to  the number of options that will ultimately vest or conversely  be forfeited prior to vesting  the expected option term  or the length of time between the grant date and date of exercise of the option  the expected volatility of our stock price  or the amount that the market value per share of our stock price will fluctuate over the estimated option term  and the expected risk free market rate of interest over the estimated option term 
the weighted average estimated fair value of stock option awards granted during the year ended june  was per share  using the black scholes option model with the following weighted average assumptions assumption weighted average assumptions expected option term years expected volatility risk free interest rate expected dividend yield we estimated the expected option term in accordance with the method described in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
we estimated volatility based upon historical experience because we have not identified a more reliable or appropriate method to estimate future volatility over the expected option term 
our risk free interest rate estimate is based upon observed interest rates comparable to the expected term of our options 
our dividend yield assumption is based upon historical and expected dividends 
our estimates for the pre vesting forfeiture rate and the estimated option term have the most significant impacts on the grant date option award fair values 
if any of these estimates change and we employ different estimates  assumptions  or a different valuation model in our application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may be significantly different than what we have recorded in the current period 
in addition  sfas r requires the expense for stock based compensation to be reduced for estimated forfeitures of unvested equity awards based on an estimate of such forfeitures as of the grant date  which must be revised in subsequent periods  if necessary  if actual pre vesting forfeitures differ from these estimates 
we estimated expected pre vesting forfeitures using our historical forfeiture experience 
deferred income taxes we estimate our actual current tax expense together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and or liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that we believe that it is more likely than not we will not recover these deferred tax assets  we must establish a valuation allowance against these tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
to the extent that we believe a valuation allowance is required  we must include and expense the tax effect of the allowance within the tax provision in our statement of operations 
as of june  and  we have million and million in deferred tax assets  respectively 
in order to fully utilize all or any portion of these deferred tax assets  we need to generate sufficient amounts of future us taxable income 
based upon our history of losses and an analysis of projected net taxable income for future operating periods  we determined that it is more likely than not that we will not realize our tax net operating loss carry forwards  tax credit carry forwards and other deferred tax assets  and have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred tax assets  reducing the carrying amount of net deferred tax assets to zero as of june  and future outlook we plan to increase our investment in drug development to advance our product pipeline and to further enhance our clinical and regulatory capabilities 
we will consider commercializing select programs ourselves with appropriate market characteristics while continuing to evaluate out licensing opportunities to maximize the risk adjusted return of our proprietary programs 
as part of these efforts  we expect near term general and administrative costs to rise in connection with increased patent and other intellectual property related costs incurred to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights in our proprietary programs and research and development for proprietary drug discovery costs to rise in connection with building our clinical and regulatory capabilities 
because of our strategy to retain other proprietary programs until later in clinical development before out licensing them or commercializing them ourselves  we may not recognize significant revenue from new out licensing opportunities in the near term 
our statements about future events in this paragraph are subject to many risks and uncertainties  including many that are beyond our control 
these risks are described more fully under the caption risk factors and elsewhere herein and in other reports filed by array biopharma with the securities and exchange commission 
results of operations fiscal years ended june    and revenue collaboration revenue consists of revenue for lead generation and lead optimization research  custom synthesis and process research  the development and sale of chemical compounds and the co development of proprietary drug candidates we out license 
license and milestone revenue is combined and reported separately from collaboration revenue 
years ended june  increase decrease to to collaboration revenue license and milestone revenue total revenue fiscal as compared to fiscal total revenue for fiscal decreased from due to a decrease in collaboration revenue of million and a decrease in license and milestone revenue of approximately  collaboration revenue declined by million due to the expiration of collaborations with astrazeneca  roche and eli lilly and company icos corporation during the prior fiscal year as well as the research portions of collaborations with intermune and takeda pharmaceutical company  ltd  that expired in fiscal additionally  collaboration revenue from the sale of optimer building blocks and lead generation libraries decreased by million during these same periods 
partially offsetting these decreases was increased revenue of million from our collaborations with genentech and ono  as well as the initiation of a new research agreement with ventirx pharmaceuticals  inc as of june  previously received license and milestone payments from astrazeneca and genentech had been fully recognized as revenue  which accounted for a decrease in license and milestone revenue of million during fiscal this decrease was partially offset by the recognition of two milestone payments totaling million from astrazeneca during fiscal for the advancement of arry into phase clinical trials and arry into phase clinical trials 
additional license and milestone revenue of million was recognized in fiscal from ventirx  intermune and eli lilly icos corporation 
fiscal as compared to fiscal total revenue for fiscal decreased from due to a decrease in license and milestone revenue of million  which was offset by improvements in collaboration revenue totaling million 
the improvement in collaboration revenue was the result of increased revenue  totaling million  from expanded programs with intermune and genentech and a new research collaboration with ono pharmaceutical 
this increase was partially offset by decreased collaboration revenue of million related to research programs that expired in fiscal with eli lilly icos corporation and qlt inc  as well as the research program with astrazeneca that expired in november additionally  collaboration revenue from the sale of lead generation libraries decreased during fiscal by million  due to the sale of a large number of our lead generation library compounds to a single collaborator during fiscal all previously received license fee and milestone payments from astrazeneca and genentech were fully recognized during fiscal resulting in a decrease in recognized revenue from fiscal of million 
partially offsetting this decrease was the recognition of million of milestone payments received from astrazeneca during fiscal related to the advancement of arry into phase b clinical trials and the selection of two additional drug candidates  as well as  of milestones earned from our collaboration with takeda 
cost of revenue cost of revenue represents research and development conducted for our collaborators and the cost of chemical compounds sold from our inventory 
these costs consist mainly of compensation  associated fringe benefits and other collaboration related costs  including supplies  small tools  facilities  depreciation  recruiting and relocation and other direct and indirect chemical handling and laboratory support costs 
fine chemicals consumed as well as any required inventory reserve adjustments are also recorded as cost of revenue 
we review the levels and values of our chemical inventories periodically and  when required  write down the carrying cost of our inventories for non marketability to estimated net realizable value through an appropriate reserve 
years ended june  increase decrease to to cost of revenue fiscal as compared to fiscal cost of revenue for fiscal decreased by from fiscal primarily reflecting a decrease in collaboration related services as a greater percentage of our resources were focused on advancing our proprietary drug discovery programs 
cost of revenue as a percentage of collaboration revenue decreased to for the fiscal year compared with for the prior fiscal year 
these decreases were largely the result of increased average pricing received from collaborations for full time equivalent scientists during fiscal resulting in fewer scientific resources used in generating the same approximate level of collaboration revenue 
additionally  share based compensation expense charged to cost of revenue for fiscal year decreased by approximately  due to option shares that became fully vested in the prior fiscal year 
on june   we assigned options we owned to purchase our boulder and longmont  colorado facilities to biomed realty lp  or biomed  which purchased those facilities in july and august we entered into new lease agreements for these facilities with biomed over a ten year lease term and began amortizing our leasehold improvement costs for these facilities over a ten year life 
prior to completing these transactions  we had determined that we were reasonably assured during fiscal that we would be vacating our boulder facility at the end of the initial lease term in march and therefore amortized the cost of leasehold improvements for that facility over an approximate two year life 
we determined the lease terms under our new facilities leases to be the fixed  non cancelable ten year term because we concluded that the exercise of optional extension periods available under the leases is not reasonably assured 
this conclusion was based on our experience with prior lease facilities and management s determination that it was unable to predict in the early years of a long term lease whether it would remain in the facilities beyond the initial lease term as a result of changing business  economic or other conditions 
the change in the amortization period from two to ten years resulted in a decrease of approximately  in amortized leasehold improvement costs charged to cost of revenue for fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
in addition  during the first quarter of fiscal  following termination of our prior facility leases and execution of new lease agreements with biomed  we reversed and recorded the entire deferred rent balance of million associated with our prior facilities leases and listed as a current liability on june   as a reduction to our recognized rent expense 
this resulted in a decrease to cost of revenue for the fiscal year of approximately  fiscal as compared to fiscal cost of revenue for fiscal increased over primarily due to the recording of million of share based compensation expense in accordance with sfas r 
in addition  in june  we determined that we were reasonably assured that we would be vacating our boulder  colorado facility at the end of the lease term in march and therefore began amortizing the cost of leasehold improvements for our facility over the remaining months of the initial lease term 
prior to that  all leasehold improvements were amortized over a period of years  which included optional lease extension periods we were reasonably assured of exercising at that time 
this change in estimated useful life resulted in an increase of approximately  in amortized leasehold improvement costs being charged to cost of revenue for the fiscal year 
improvements in cost of revenue as a percentage of collaboration revenue of in fiscal compared to in fiscal is the result of improved average pricing from collaboration agreements 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery include costs associated with our proprietary drug programs for scientific personnel  supplies  equipment  consultants  sponsored research  allocated facility costs  costs related to preclinical and clinical trials  and share based compensation 
we manage our proprietary programs based on scientific data and achievement of research plan goals 
our scientists record their time to specific projects when possible 
however  many activities simultaneously benefit multiple projects and cannot be readily attributed to a specific project 
accordingly  the accurate assignment of time and costs to a specific project is difficult and may not give a true indication of the actual costs of a particular project 
as a result  we do not report costs on a program basis 
the following table shows our research and development expenses by categories of costs for the periods presented years ended june  increase to to salaries  benefits and share based compensation expense outsourced services and consulting laboratory supplies facilities and depreciation other research and development expense for proprietary drug discovery fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development expenses increased over the prior comparative fiscal year as a result of increases in the number of scientists devoted to proprietary programs  reflecting both increased headcount as well as a shift of existing scientific resources from collaborative projects to internal proprietary discovery 
the most significant increase in costs came from outsourced pharmacology studies and clinical trial related expenses supporting the advancement of our erbb egfr  mek for inflammation  erbb  p tie and other programs 
during fiscal we expensed million of share based compensation expense to research and development expenses compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
we expect that proprietary research and development spending will continue to increase significantly as we focus more resources on our proprietary drug discovery programs and continue to advance our programs through clinical development 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in leasehold improvement amortization and rent expense allocated to research and development expenses as described in cost of revenue above 
the change in estimated useful life of our leasehold improvements resulted in a reduction of amortization of leasehold improvement costs charged to research and development expenses for the fiscal year of approximately  additionally  the reversal of the prior year deferred rent balance resulted in a reduction to rent expense allocated to research and development expenses for the fiscal year of approximately  fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development expenses increased in fiscal over the prior fiscal year primarily due to additional scientists working on proprietary programs  related increases in laboratory supplies  share based compensation expense  and increased pharmacology studies supporting our expanded efforts to advance proprietary compounds into regulated safety testing and clinical trials 
the most significant increase in costs came from outsourced pharmacology studies and clinical trial related expenses supporting the advancement of our erbb egfr  mek for inflammation  p  ksp and other programs 
for fiscal year  we expensed million to research and development expenses related to share based compensation in accordance with sfas r 
in addition  as described in cost of revenue above  we recorded approximately  of additional leasehold improvement amortization to research and development expenses during the fiscal year 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict given the number of studies that will need to be conducted for any of our potential products  as well as our limited capital resources 
in general  drug development involves a series of steps beginning with identification of a potential target and including  among others  proof of concept in animal studies and phase  and clinical studies in humans each of which is typically more expensive than the previous step 
therefore  we expect our research and development costs to increase as we progress our programs through later stage development 
the successful development and commercialization of drugs resulting from our proprietary programs is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks that are beyond our control 
the duration and cost of discovery  preclinical  non clinical and clinical trials may vary significantly based on the type  complexity and novelty of a product and are difficult to predict 
the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products  typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures  sampling activities and other costly and time consuming procedures 
data obtained from preclinical  non clinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activity or be susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our drug candidates to market are not available 
given the uncertainties related to development  we are currently unable to reliably estimate when  if ever  our drug candidates will generate revenue and net cash inflows 
status of significant proprietary programs the following table summarizes the status of our most advanced drug programs

we estimate that it takes to years  or possibly longer  to discover  develop and bring to market a new pharmaceutical product in the united states as outlined in the following table phase objective estimated duration discovery lead identification and target validation to years preclinical initial toxicology for preliminary identification of risks for humans  gather early pharmacokinetic data to years phase evaluate safety in humans  study how the drug works  metabolizes and interacts with other drugs to years phase establish effectiveness of the drug and its optimal dosage  continue safety evaluation to years phase confirm efficacy  dosage regime and safety profile of the drug  submit new drug application to years fda approval approval by the fda to sell and market the drug under approved labeling months to years animal and other non clinical studies are often conducted during each phase of human clinical studies 
we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which research programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each drug candidate 
the lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals  and subsequent compliance with applicable regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist mainly of compensation and associated fringe benefits not included in cost of revenue or research and development expenses and include other management  business development  accounting  information technology and administration costs  including patent prosecution  recruiting and relocation  consulting and professional services  travel and meals  advertising  sales commissions  facilities  depreciation and other office expenses 
years ended june  increase decrease to to general and administrative expenses fiscal as compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately  during the fiscal year over the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of decreased share based compensation expense of approximately  recognized upon the vesting of option shares in the prior fiscal year 
as described in cost of revenue above  the change in estimated useful life of our leasehold improvements resulted in a reduction of amortization of leasehold improvement costs charged to general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year of approximately  and the reversal of the prior year deferred rent balance resulted in a reduction to rent expense allocated to general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year of approximately  partially offsetting all these decreases in general and administrative expenses were increases in patents and patent application costs of approximately  for the fiscal year associated with the advancement of our propriety drug development programs 
the remaining increase in general and administrative expenses from the prior year was attributable to increases in compensation and benefit expenses 
fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal over fiscal was primarily related to the recording of million of share based compensation expense in accordance with sfas r 
patents and patent application costs increased by approximately  related to our expanding proprietary drug development programs 
in addition  as described in cost of revenue above  we recorded approximately  of additional leasehold improvement amortization to general and administrative expenses during the fiscal year 
the remaining increase within general and administrative expenses from the prior year was attributable to increases in compensation and benefit related expenses 
interest expense and income years ended june  increase to to interest expense interest income fiscal as compared to fiscal interest expense increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to increased borrowings and higher effective interest rates related to our long term borrowings 
interest income increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to higher effective interest rates and higher average cash and investment balances 
fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to higher investment interest rates earned on higher average cash and investment balances 
we incurred interest expense associated with our long term borrowings in fiscal there were no borrowings in liquidity and capital resources as of june  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities net increase decrease in operating assets and liabilities  excluding cash purchases of equipment  leasehold improvements and other property cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities fiscal as compared to fiscal we have historically funded our operations through revenue from our collaborations and the issuance of equity securities 
as of june   cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities totaled million compared with million at june  net cash used in operating activities for fiscal year was million  compared to million for fiscal during fiscal year  our net loss of million was reduced by noncash charges of million  primarily associated with depreciation  share based compensation expense  and deferred rent credits 
for fiscal year  our net operating assets and liabilities excluding cash decreased by million 
this was primarily due to increases in accounts payable and accrued compensation and benefits and decreases in accounts receivable which were partially offset by decreases in advance payments from collaborators 
accounts payable increased by million due to increased obligations for outsourced pharmacology and clinical trial expenses  fine chemicals  and facilities improvements 
accrued compensation and benefits increased by million  half of which was due to increased amounts reserved for fiscal year employee bonuses with the remainder due to increased vacation reserves as well as increased k  deferred compensation and employee stock purchase plan payroll withholdings attributable to our larger employee base 
advance payments from collaborators decreased by approximately  as we concluded collaboration programs with intermune and takeda  which accounted for a year over year decrease of million  and we recorded million of advance payments including million non cash equity stake  net of related amortization  as a result of a new collaboration agreement with ventirx pharmaceuticals  inc accounts receivable decreased by million in conjunction with collaboration agreements that expired during fiscal as well as decreased receivables from sales of our optimer building blocks

we invested million in property  plant and equipment  primarily in lab equipment for drug metabolism  analytical research and development operations  process chemistry and biology  as well as in improvements to our facilities  and various computer hardware and software 
purchases of marketable securities used million of cash while proceeds from the sale and maturity of marketable securities provided million of cash 
financing activities provided million of cash consisting of million in net proceeds from our public common stock offering  million of cash resulting from the exercise of stock options under our stock option plan and purchases of stock under our espp  and approximately  of proceeds received from the issuance of long term debt used to finance purchases of capital equipment 
fiscal as compared to fiscal as of june   cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities totaled million compared with million at june  net cash used in operating activities for fiscal year was million  compared to million for fiscal during fiscal year  our net loss of million was reduced by non cash charges of million  primarily associated with depreciation and share based compensation expense 
for the fiscal year  our net operating assets and liabilities  excluding cash  decreased by approximately  this was primarily due to increases in accounts payable and accrued compensation and benefits  which were slightly offset by decreases in advance payment balances from collaborators 
accounts payable increased by million due to increased obligations for outsourced pharmacology and clinical trial related expenses  as well as laboratory equipment received in june accrued compensation and benefits increased by million  half of which was due to increased amounts reserved for fiscal year employee bonuses as well as  related to employee payroll withholdings for the employee stock purchase plan due to the change in purchase dates within the plan 
advance payments from collaborators decreased by million during fiscal year due to the recognition of revenue from previously received up front license and milestone payments  slightly offset by the receipt of new milestone payments during the fiscal year 
during fiscal year  we invested million in laboratory equipment  primarily for biology  drug metabolism and analytical research and development operations  as well as in various computer hardware and software 
purchases of marketable securities used million of cash while proceeds from the sale and maturity of marketable securities provided million of cash 
additionally  million of previously restricted cash became available for use in operations 
financing activities provided million of cash consisting of million for proceeds received from the issuance of long term debt used to finance purchases of capital equipment and million of cash resulting from the exercise of stock options under our stock option plan and purchases of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the rate at which we invest in proprietary research  the growth of our clinical development capabilities  the growth or decline of our collaboration business and the amount of collaboration research funding we receive  the timing of milestone and royalty payments  if any  from our collaboration and out licensed programs  our capital spending on new facilities and equipment  the number and size of phase or phase clinical trials we decide to run  expenses associated with unforeseen litigation  regulatory changes  competition  technological developments  general economic conditions and the extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses  products and technologies 
in addition  our future capital requirements may be impacted if we do not receive potential milestone or royalty payments under our existing or future collaboration agreements 
our ability to realize these payments is subject to a number of risks  many of which are beyond our control and include the following the drug development process is risky and highly uncertain  and we or our collaborators may not be successful in commercializing drug candidates we create  our collaborators have substantial control and discretion over the timing and continued development and marketing of drug candidates we create  the sale and manufacture of drug candidates we develop may not obtain regulatory approval  and  if regulatory approval is received  drugs we develop will remain subject to regulation or may not gain market acceptance  which could delay or prevent us from generating milestone  royalty revenue or product revenue from the commercialization of these drugs 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and anticipated cash flow from existing collaboration agreements will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for at least the next months 
this estimate of our future capital requirements is a forward looking statement that is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
our actual future capital requirements could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the progress of our research and development activities  our ability to enter into agreements to out license and co develop our proprietary drug candidates  and the timing of those agreements in each candidate s development stage  the number and scope of our research and development programs  the progress of our preclinical and clinical development activities  the number and scope of phase and phase studies we may decide to run  the progress of the development efforts of our collaborators  the availability of resources for revenue generating collaborations as we devote more resources to our proprietary programs  our ability to establish and maintain current and new collaboration agreements  the ability of our collaborators to fund research and development programs  the costs involved in enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  and the costs of establishing clinical development and distribution or commercialization capabilities 
until we can generate sufficient levels of cash from our operations  which we do not expect to achieve in the foreseeable future  we expect to continue to utilize our existing cash and marketable securities resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds of our equity offerings and from our collaborations 
in addition  we may finance future cash needs through the sale of equity securities  strategic collaboration agreements and debt financing 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining new or in retaining existing out license or collaboration agreements  in securing agreements for the co development of our proprietary drug candidates  or in receiving milestone and or royalty payments under those agreements  that our existing cash and marketable securities resources will be adequate or that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  this financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose  or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
obligations and commitments the following table shows our contractual obligations and commitments as of june  payments due by period less than year years years after years total operating lease obligations purchase obligations debt obligations including interest  using current rate of total obligations we are obligated under non cancelable operating leases for our facilities and certain equipment leases 
original lease terms for our facilities in effect as of june  were ten years and generally require us to pay the real estate taxes  insurance and other operating costs 
equipment leases generally range from three to five years 
purchase obligations totaling million were primarily for outsourced clinical and pharmacology services  facilities improvements  laboratory equipment  chemicals and supplies 
as described more fully above under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  on june   we entered into a series of agreements involving the assignment to biomed of options we acquired to purchase the facilities that we occupy in boulder and longmont  colorado and the subsequent lease of those facilities from biomed 
total operating lease obligations under the boulder lease amount to million over the lease term  and account for million of operating lease obligations within the above table 
total operating lease obligations under the longmont lease are million over the lease term  and account for million of operating lease obligations within the above table 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices  and interest rates 
all of our collaboration agreements and nearly all purchase orders are denominated in united states dollars 
as a result  historically and as of june   we have had little or no exposure to market risk in the area of changes in foreign currency or exchange rates 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investments in marketable securities 
the investment portfolio is comprised primarily of readily marketable  high quality securities diversified and structured to minimize market risks while providing a reasonable return on invested funds 
we target our average portfolio maturity at one year or less 
nevertheless  the securities held in our investments portfolio are subject to changes in market value in response to changes in interest rates 
in addition  a significant change in market interest rates could have a material impact on interest income earned from our investment portfolio 
given the current balance of million of investments classified as cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale  a theoretical basis point change in interest rates and security prices would impact our net income loss positively or negatively by approximately million 
because our portfolio of marketable securities available for sale will mature in a short period of time  our exposure to changes in the fair value of these investments is not significant 
we are also impacted by adverse changes in interest rates relating to variable rate borrowings under our credit facility 
we pay interest on advances under our loan agreement at one of three variable rates  which are adjusted periodically for changes in the underlying prevailing rate 
changes in prevailing interest rates will not affect the fair value of our debt  but would impact future results of operations and cash flows 
at june   we had million of long term debt outstanding  and the interest rate on our term loan and equipment advances was 
this rate is adjusted based on changes in the bank s prime lending rate 
assuming constant debt levels  a theoretical change of basis points in our interest rate would result in a change in our annual interest expense of approximately  historically  and as of june   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities
