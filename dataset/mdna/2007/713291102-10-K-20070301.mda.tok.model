management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pepco holdings  inc 
general overview pepco holdings  inc phi or pepco holdings is a diversified energy company that  through its operating subsidiaries  is engaged primarily in two principal business operations electricity and natural gas delivery power delivery  and competitive energy generation  marketing and supply competitive energy 
in   and  respectively  phi s power delivery operations produced  and of phi s consolidated operating revenues including revenues from intercompany amounts and  and of phi s consolidated operating income including income from intercompany transactions 
the power delivery business consists primarily of the transmission  distribution and default supply of electric power  which for   and  was responsible for  and  respectively  of power delivery s operating revenues 
the distribution of natural gas contributed  and of power delivery s operating revenues in  and  respectively 
power delivery represents one operating segment for financial reporting purposes 
the power delivery business is conducted by three utility subsidiaries potomac electric power company pepco  delmarva power light company dpl and atlantic city electric company ace 
each of these companies is a regulated public utility in the jurisdictions that comprise its service territory 
each company is responsible for the distribution of electricity and  in the case of dpl  natural gas in its service territory  for which it is paid tariff rates established by the applicable local public service commissions 
each company also supplies electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territory who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier 
the regulatory term for this supply service varies by jurisdiction as follows delaware provider of last resort service polr before may  standard offer service sos on and after may  district of columbia sos maryland sos new jersey basic generation service bgs virginia default service in this form k  these supply service obligations are referred to generally as default electricity supply 
pepco  dpl and ace are also responsible for the transmission of wholesale electricity into and across their service territories 
the rates each company is permitted to charge for the wholesale transmission of electricity are regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
effective june   new ferc approved transmission rates took effect for each of phi s utility subsidiaries 
these new rates incorporate true ups for the formula rates that went into effect june   on a tentative basis  which reflected a requested return on equity  as compared to the approved rates  which were based on a return on equity of for existing facilities and for facilities put into service on or after january  for the year ended december   lower transmission revenues resulted in a 
decrease in phi s earnings per share as compared to the year ended december   a portion of which was attributable to the lower rates combined with the operation of the true up adjustment to compensate for the higher tentative rates 
phi expects the lower rates in effect and the true up to have a similar proportionate impact on earnings through may as compared to earnings 
however  because the magnitude of the true u p for this first twelve month period  june through may  was attributable in part to the transition to the new formula rate process  phi expects that the impact of the annual true up adjustment will be less significant in future years 
the profitability of the power delivery business depends on its ability to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments through the rates it is permitted to charge 
power delivery s operating revenue and income are seasonal  and weather patterns may have a material impact on operating results 
in addition  customer usage may be affected by economic conditions  energy prices  and energy efficiency measures 
the competitive energy business provides competitive generation  marketing and supply of electricity and gas  and related energy management services primarily in the mid atlantic region 
these operations are conducted through subsidiaries of conectiv energy holding company collectively  conectiv energy and pepco energy services  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  pepco energy services  each of which is treated as a separate operating segment for financial reporting purposes 
for the years ended december   and  the operating revenues of the competitive energy business including revenue from intercompany transactions were equal to  and  respectively  of phi s consolidated operating revenues  and the operating income of the competitive energy business including operating income from intercompany transactions was  and of phi s consolidated operating income for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  amounts equal to  and respectively  of the operating revenues of the competitive energy business were attributable to electric energy and capacity  and natural gas sold to the power delivery segment 
conectiv energy provides wholesale electric power  capacity and ancillary services in the wholesale markets administered by pjm interconnection  llc pjm and also supplies electricity to other wholesale market participants under long and short term bilateral contracts 
conectiv energy also supplies electric power to satisfy a portion of ace s new jersey  pepco s maryland and dpl s delaware  maryland  and virginia default electricity supply load  as well as default electricity supply load shares of other utilities 
phi refers to these activities as merchant generation load service 
conectiv energy obtains the electricity required to meet its merchant generation load service power supply obligations from its own generation plants  bilateral contract purchases from other wholesale market participants  and purchases in the pjm wholesale market 
conectiv energy also sells natural gas and fuel oil to very large end users and to wholesale market participants under bilateral agreements 
p hi refers to these sales operations as energy marketing 
pepco energy services provides retail energy supply and energy services primarily to commercial  industrial  and government customers 
pepco energy services sells electricity and natural gas to customers primarily in the mid atlantic region 
pepco energy services owns and operates two district energy systems  provides energy savings performance contracting services  and designs  constructs and operates combined heat and power and central energy plants 
pepco energy services provides high voltage construction and maintenance services to customers throughout the us and low voltage construction and maintenance services in the washington  dc area and owns and operates electric generating plants in washington  dc conectiv energy s primary objective is to maximize the value of its generation fleet by leveraging its operational and fuel flexibilities 
pepco energy services primary objective is to capture retail energy supply and service opportunities primarily in the mid atlantic region 
the financial results of the competitive energy business can be significantly affected by wholesale and retail energy prices  the cost of fuel to operate the conectiv energy plants  and the cost of purchased energy necessary to meet its power supply obligations 
the competitive energy business  like the power delivery business  is seasonal  and therefore weather patterns can have a material impact on operating results 
over the last several years  phi has discontinued its investments in non energy related businesses  and has sold its aircraft investments and its interest in starpower communications  llc starpower 
through its subsidiary  potomac capital investment corporation pci  phi continues to maintain a portfolio of cross border energy sale leaseback transactions with a book value at december  of approximately billion 
this activity constitutes a fourth operating segment  which is designated as other non regulated  for financial reporting purposes 
for a discussion of phi s cross border leasing transactions  see regulatory and other matters federal income tax treatment of cross border leases below 
business strategy phi s business strategy is to remain a regional diversified energy delivery utility and competitive energy services company focused on value creation and operational excellence 
this strategy has three primary components achieving earnings growth in the power delivery business by focusing on infrastructure investments and constructive regulatory outcomes  while maintaining a high level of operational excellence 
supplementing phi s utility earnings through competitive energy businesses that focus on serving the competitive wholesale and retail markets primarily in pjm 
maintaining phi s investment grade credit ratings

competitive energy businesses conectiv energy the impact of operating revenue changes and fuel and purchased energy and other services cost of sales changes with respect to the conectiv energy component of the competitive energy business are encompassed within the discussion that follows 
operating revenues of the conectiv energy segment are derived primarily from the sale of electricity 
the primary components of its costs of sales are fuel and purchased power 
because fuel and electricity prices tend to move in tandem  price changes in these commodities from period to period can have a significant impact on operating revenue and costs of sales without signifying any change in the performance of the conectiv energy segment 
for this reason  phi from a managerial standpoint focuses on gross margin as a measure of performance 
conectiv energy gross margin the following discussion of the results of operations for the conectiv energy segment combines as a single business activity designated as merchant generation load service the activities that in prior reports were designated as merchant generation and full requirements load service 
this change has been implemented because full requirements load service contracts are primarily used  along with other hedges already contained in the prior merchant generation category  to hedge capacity and energy output from conectiv energy s generation plants 
merchant generation load service consists primarily of electric power  capacity and ancillary services sales from conectiv energy s generating plants  tolling arrangements entered into sell energy and other products from conectiv energy s generating plants and to purchase energy and other products from generating plants of other companies  hedges of power  capacity  fuel and load  the sale of excess fuel primarily natural gas and emission allowances  electric power  capacity  and ancillary services sales pursuant to competitively bid contracts entered into with affiliated and non affiliated companies to fulfill their default electricity supply obligations  and fuel switching activities made possible by the multi fuel capabilities of some of conectiv energy s power plants 
in addition  the activity designated as other power  oil and gas marketing services in previous reports has been renamed energy marketing 
energy marketing activities continue to consist primarily of wholesale natural gas and fuel oil marketing  the activities of the real time power desk  which generates margin by capturing price differences between power pools  and locational and timing differences within a power pool  and prior to october   provided operating services under an agreement with an unaffiliated generating plant

conectiv energy revenue and cost of sales are lower in primarily due to lower fuel prices and correspondingly lower electricity prices 
lower sales of default electricity supply was a lesser factor 
merchant generation load service gross margin decreased 
milder weather during  coupled with lower spark spreads and an unplanned summer outage at the hay road generating facility  resulted in a decrease in output from conectiv energy s generating plants 
sales of ancillary services and fuel switching activities contributed less to gross margin in than in new higher margin default electricity service contracts which replaced expiring higher volume  but lower margin default electricity supply sales  a mark to market gain on a supply contract  and hedging gains helped reduce the gross margin decrease 
energy marketing gross margins increased million in compared to  primarily due to improved inventory management in the oil marketing business that resulted in a million increase and increased gross margins of million in the gas marketing business from gains on storage  transportation  and supply contracts

pepco holdings expects to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash from the power delivery businesses and from external financing 
dividends pepco holdings annual dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the board of directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration  among other factors  current and possible future developments that may affect phi s income and cash flows 
in  phi s board of directors declared quarterly dividends of cents per share of common stock payable on march   june   september  and december  on january   the board of directors declared a dividend on common stock of cents per share payable march   to shareholders of record march  phi generates no operating income of its own 
accordingly  its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders depends on dividends received from its subsidiaries 
in addition to their future financial performance  the ability of phi s direct and indirect subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to limits imposed by i state corporate and regulatory laws  which impose limitations on the funds that can be used to pay dividends and  in the case of regulatory laws  as applicable  may require the prior approval of the relevant utility regulatory commissions before dividends can be paid  ii the prior rights of holders of existing and future preferred stock  mortgage bonds and other long term debt issued by the subsidiaries  and any other restrictions imposed in connection with the incurrence of liabilities  and iii certain provisions of ace s certificate of incorporation which provides that  if any preferred stock is outstanding  no dividends may be paid on the ace common sto ck if  after payment  ace s common stock capital plus surplus would be less than the involuntary liquidation value of the outstanding preferred stock 
pepco and dpl have no shares of preferred stock outstanding 
currently  the restriction in the ace charter does not limit its ability to pay dividends 
pension funding pepco holdings has a noncontributory retirement plan the phi retirement plan that covers substantially all employees of pepco  dpl and ace and certain employees of other pepco holdings subsidiaries 
as of the valuation  the phi retirement plan satisfied the minimum funding requirements of the employment retirement income security act of erisa without requiring any additional funding 
phi s funding policy with regard to the phi retirement plan is to maintain a funding level in excess of of its accumulated benefit obligation abo 
in  no contribution was made to the phi retirement plan 
in  phi made a discretionary tax deductible cash contribution in the amount of million all of which was funded by ace to the phi retirement plan in accordance with its funding policy 
in  the abo for the phi retirement plan decreased from  due to an increase in the discount rate used to value the abo obligation  which more than offset the accrual of an additional year of service for participants 
the phi retirement plan assets achieved returns in above the level assumed in the valuation 
as a result of the combination of these factors  no contribution was made to the phi retirement plan  because the funding level at year end was in excess of of the abo 
in  phi contributed a total of million all of which was funded by ace to the phi retirement plan 
assuming no changes to the current pension plan assumptions  phi projects no funding will be required under erisa in  however  phi may elect to make a discretionary tax deductible contribution  if required to maintain its assets in excess of abo for the phi retirement plan 
recent legislative changes  in the form of the pension protection act of  impact t he funding requirements for pension plans beginning in the pension protection act alters the manner in which liabilities and asset values are determined for the purpose of calculating required pension contributions 
based on preliminary actuarial projections and assuming no changes to current pension plan assumptions  phi believes it is unlikely that there will be any required contribution in contractual obligations and commercial commitments summary information about pepco holdings consolidated contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december   is as follows contractual maturity obligation a total less than year years years after years millions of dollars variable rate demand bonds commercial paper long term debt pes project funding interest payments on debt capital leases operating leases non derivative fuel and purchase power contracts b total a estimates relating to the future funding of phi s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are excluded from this table

subsidiaries of pepco holdings have guaranteed residual values in excess of fair value related to certain equipment and fleet vehicles held through lease agreements 
as of december   obligations under the guarantees were approximately million 
assets leased under agreements subject to residual value guarantees are typically for periods ranging from years to years 
historically  payments under the guarantees have not been made by the guarantor as  under normal conditions  the contract runs to full term at which time the residual value is minimal 
as such  pepco holdings believes the likelihood of payment being required under the guarantee is remote 
other guarantees consist of pepco holdings has guaranteed a subsidiary building lease of million 
pepco holdings does not expect to fund the full amount of the exposure under the guarantee

contractual arrangements with credit rating triggers or margining rights under certain contractual arrangements entered into by phi s subsidiaries in connection with competitive energy and other transactions  the subsidiary may be required to provide cash collateral or letters of credit as security for its contractual obligations if the credit ratings of the subsidiary are downgraded 
in the event of a downgrade  the amount required to be posted would depend on the amount of the underlying contractual obligation existing at the time of the downgrade 
as of december   a one level downgrade in the credit rating of phi and all of its affected subsidiaries would have required phi and such subsidiaries to provide an additional million of aggregate cash collateral or letters of credit 
phi believes that it and its utility subsidiaries maintain adequate short term funding sources in the event the additional collateral or letters of credit are required 
see sources of capital short term funding sources 
many of the contractual arrangements entered into by phi s subsidiaries in connection with competitive energy activities include margining rights pursuant to which the phi subsidiary or a counterparty may request collateral if the market value of the contractual obligations reaches levels in excess of the credit thresholds established in the applicable arrangements 
pursuant to these margining rights  the affected phi subsidiary may receive  or be required to post  collateral due to energy price movements 
as of december   pepco holdings subsidiaries engaged in competitive energy activities and default supply activities provided cash collateral in the amount of approximately million in connection with their competitive energy activities

that plant was sold on june  ace s entry into a sale agreement in which was subsequently terminated for the bl england and deepwater generating facilities ace transferred the deepwater generating facility to conectiv energy in triggered the applicability of the new jersey industrial site recovery act requiring remediation at these facilities 
when the prospective purchaser of these generating facilities terminated the agreement of sale in accordance with the agreement s termination provisions  ace decided to continue the environmental investigation process at these facilities 
ace and conectiv energy have been continuing the investigation with oversight from new jersey department of environmental protection njdep 
conectiv energy anticipates that it will incur approximately million in environmental remediation costs  of which  is expected to be incurred in  associated with the deepwater generating facility 
rc cape may holdings  llc rc cape may  an affiliate of rockland capital energy investments  llc  the purchaser of the bl england generating facility  has entered into a remediation agreement with the njdep under which it will assume responsibility for remediation at bl england 
in the event that rc cape may fails to remediate groundwater or other resources at bl england  the responsibility for such remediation will revert to ace 
dpl expects to incur costs of approximately million including approximately  in in connection with the wilmington coal gas south site located in wilmington  delaware  to remediate residual material from the historical operation of a manufactured gas plant

phi s ability to generate funds from its operations and to access capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties 
see item a 
risk factors for a discussion of important factors that may impact these sources of capital 
internally generated cash the primary source of pepco holdings internally generated funds is the cash flow generated by its regulated utility subsidiaries in the power delivery business 
additional sources of funds include cash flow generated from its non regulated subsidiaries and the sale of non core assets 
short term funding sources pepco holdings and its regulated utility subsidiaries have traditionally used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs  such as commercial paper  short term notes and bank lines of credit 
proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs but may also be used to fund temporarily long term capital requirements 
pepco holdings maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to million 
pepco  dpl  and ace have ongoing commercial paper programs of up to million  up to million  and up to million  respectively 
the commercial paper can be issued with maturities up to days from the date of issue 
the commercial paper programs of phi  pepco  dpl  and ace are backed by a billion credit facility 
long term funding sources the sources of long term funding for phi and its subsidiaries are the issuance of debt and equity securities and borrowing under long term credit agreements 
proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements  such as capital expenditures and new investments  and to repay or refinance existing indebtedness 
puhca restrictions under puhca and the federal power act  ferc has jurisdiction previously held by the sec under puhca over the issuance of certain securities by pepco  dpl and ace 
in accordance with regulations adopted by ferc  pepco holdings has notified ferc that it will continue until further notice to issue such securities under the authority granted in the financing order issued by the sec under puhca  which has an authorization period ending june  the financing order 
the financing order authorizes the issuance of equity  preferred securities and debt securities in an aggregate amount not to exceed billion through an authorization period ending june   subject to a ceiling on the effective cost of these funds 
in order to issue debt or equity securities pursuant to the financing order authorization  pepco  ace and dpl  respectively  must a maintain a ratio of common stock equity to total capitalization consisting  for this purpose  of common stock  preferred stock  if any  long term debt and short term debt for this purpose of at least percent  and b have an investment grade rating by at least one nationally recognized rating agency for any rated securities issued 
at december   the common equity ratios for purposes of the financing order for pepco  dpl and ace  respectively  were   and 
if these conditions are not met  the affected utility could not issue the security under the financing order and may need to first obtain a new financing authorization from ferc 
if ferc authorization pursuant to the federal power act or ferc regulations is required to enable the utility subsidiaries to effect a financing  there is no certainty that such authorization could be obtained nor certainty as to the timing of ferc action 
money pool under the financing order  pepco holdings operates a system money pool 
the money pool is a cash management mechanism used by pepco holdings to manage the short term investment and borrowing requirements of its subsidiaries that participate in the money pool 
pepco holdings may invest in but not borrow from the money pool 
eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool 
deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by pepco holdings 
eligible subsidiaries with cash requirements may borrow from the money pool 
borrowings from the money pool are unsecured 
depositors in the money pool receive  and borrowers from the money pool pay  an interest rate based primarily on pepco holdings short term borrowing rate 
pepco holdings deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient funds to meet the borrowing needs of its participants  which may require pepco holdings to borrow funds for deposit from external sources 
regulatory and other matters relationship with mirant corporation in  pepco sold substantially all of its electricity generating assets to mirant formerly southern energy  inc 
in july  mirant filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of texas the bankruptcy court 
on december   the bankruptcy court approved the plan of reorganization the reorganization plan of mirant  and the mirant business emerged from bankruptcy on january   as a new corporation of the same name for purposes of this section  together with its predecessors  mirant 
as part of the bankruptcy proceeding  mirant had been seeking to reject certain ongoing contractual arrangements under the asset purchase and sale agreement entered into by pepco and mirant for the sale of the generating assets that are described below 
the reorganization plan did not resolve the issues relating to mirant s efforts to reject these obligations nor did it resolve certain pepco damage claims against the mirant bankruptcy estate 
power purchase agreement the panda ppa obligates pepco to purchase from panda megawatts of energy and capacity annually through at the time of the sale of pepco s generating assets to mirant  the purchase price of the energy and capacity under the panda ppa was  and since that time has continued to be  substantially in excess of the market price 
as a part of the asset purchase and sale agreement  pepco entered into a back to back arrangement with mirant 
under this arrangement  mirant is obligated through to purchase from pepco the capacity and energy that pepco is obligated to purchase under the panda ppa at a price equal to pepco s purchase price from panda the ppa related obligations 
the smeco agreement under the asset purchase and sale agreement  pepco assigned to mirant a facility and capacity agreement entered into by pepco with southern maryland electric cooperative  inc smeco  under which pepco was obligated to purchase from smeco the capacity of an megawatt combustion turbine installed and owned by smeco at a former pepco generating facility at a cost of approximately  per month until the smeco agreement 
pepco is responsible to smeco for the performance of the smeco agreement if mirant fails to perform its obligations thereunder 
settlement agreements with mirant on may   pepco  phi  and certain affiliated companies entered into a settlement agreement and release the settlement agreement with mirant  which  subject to court approval  settles all outstanding issues between the parties arising from or related to the mirant bankruptcy 
under the terms of the settlement agreement mirant will assume the asset purchase and sale agreement  except for the ppa related obligations  which mirant will be permitted to reject 
pepco will receive an allowed claim under the reorganization plan in an amount that will result in a total aggregate distribution to pepco  net of certain transaction expenses  of million  consisting of i million in damages resulting from the rejection of the ppa related obligations and ii million in settlement of other pepco damage claims against the mirant bankruptcy estate the pepco distribution 
except as described below  the million pepco distribution will be effected by means of the issuance to pepco of shares of mirant common stock consisting of an initial distribution of million shares of mirant common stock  followed thereafter by a number of shares of mirant common stock to be determined  which pepco will be obligated to resell promptly in one or more block sale transactions 
if the net proceeds that pepco receives from the resale of the shares of mirant common stock are less than million  pepco will receive a cash payment from mirant equal to the difference  and if the net proceeds that pepco receives from the resale of the shares of mirant common stock are more than million  pepco will make a cash payment to mirant equal to the difference 
if the closing price of shares of mirant common stock is less than per share for four business days in a twenty consecutive business day period  and mirant has not made a distribution of shares of mirant common stock to pepco under the settlement agreement  mirant has the one time option to elect to assume  rather than reject  the ppa related obligations 
if mirant elects to assume the ppa related obligations  the pepco distribution will be reduced to million 
all pending appeals  adversary actions or other contested matters between pepco and mirant will be dismissed with prejudice  and each will release the other from any and all claims relating to the mirant bankruptcy 
separately  mirant and smeco have entered into a settlement agreement and release the smeco settlement agreement 
the smeco settlement agreement provides that mirant will assume  rather than reject  the smeco agreement 
this assumption ensures that pepco will not incur liability to smeco as the guarantor of the smeco agreement due to the rejection of the smeco agreement  although pepco will continue to guarantee to smeco the future performance of mirant under the smeco agreement 
according to their terms  the settlement agreement and the smeco settlement agreement will become effective when the bankruptcy court or the united states district court for the northern district of texas the district court  as applicable  has entered a final order  not subject to appeal or rehearing  approving both the settlement agreement and the smeco settlement agreement 
on august   the bankruptcy court issued an order approving the settlement agreement and the smeco settlement agreement 
on august   certain holders of mirant bankruptcy claims  who had objected to approval of the settlement agreement and the smeco settlement agreement before the bankruptcy court  appealed the approval order to the district court 
on december   the district court issued an order affirming the bankruptcy court s order approving the settlement agreement 
on january   the parties that previously appealed the bankruptcy court s order filed a notice of appeal of the district court s order with the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit the fifth circuit 
on february   the fifth circuit issued a briefing schedule 
the brief of the appealing creditors is due on march   while mirant s and pepco s briefs are due on april in august  mirant made a cash payment to pepco of million  which became due in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement as a result of the approval of the settlement agreement by the bankruptcy court 
if the bankruptcy court order approving the settlement agreement becomes a final order after the exhaustion of all appeals  the payment will be taken into account as if it were proceeds from the resale by pepco of shares of the mirant common stock  as described above  and treated as a portion of the million payment due pepco 
if the bankruptcy court approval of the settlement agreement is not upheld on appeal  pepco must repay this cash payment to mirant 
therefore  no income statement impact has been recognized in relation to the million payment 
until the approval of the settlement agreement and the smeco settlement agreement becomes final  mirant is required to continue to perform all of its contractual obligations to pepco and smeco 
pepco intends to use the million portion of the pepco distribution related to the rejection of the ppa related obligations to pay for future capacity and energy purchases under the panda ppa 
in litigation prior to the entry into the settlement agreement  the district court had entered orders denying mirant s attempt to reject the ppa related obligations and directing mirant to resume making payments to pepco pursuant to the ppa related obligations  which mirant had suspended 
mirant is making the payments as required by the district court order 
on july   the fifth circuit issued an opinion affirming the district court s orders 
on september   mirant filed a petition for rehearing and motion to stay the appeals pending completion of the settlement between the parties 
on september   the fifth circuit issued an order denying mirant s motion for stay 
on september   the fifth circuit issued an order summarily denying mirant s petition for rehearing 
the appeal period has expired and that order is now final and nonappealable 
rate proceedings phi s regulated utility subsidiaries currently have four active distribution base rate cases underway 
pepco has filed electric distribution base rate cases in the district of columbia and maryland  dpl has filed a gas distribution base rate case in delaware which is the subject of a settlement agreement as discussed below and an electric base rate case in maryland 
in each of these cases  the utility has proposed the adoption of a bill stabilization adjustment mechanism bsa for retail customers 
the bsa will increase rates if revenues from distribution deliveries fall below the level approved by the applicable regulatory commission and will decrease rates if revenues from distribution deliveries are above the commission approved level 
the end result will be that the utility will collect its authorized revenues for distribution deliveries 
as a consequence  a bsa decouples revenue from unit sales consumption and ties the growth in revenues to the growth in the num ber of customers 
some advantages of the bsa are that it i eliminates revenue fluctuations due to weather and changes in customer usage patterns and  therefore  provides for more predictable utility distribution revenues that are better aligned with costs  ii provides for more reliable fixed cost recovery  iii tends to stabilize customers delivery bills  and iv removes any disincentives for the regulated utilities to promote energy efficiency programs for their customers  because it breaks the link between overall sales volumes and delivery revenues 
dpl has proposed a monthly bsa in the gas base rate case and  in each of the electric base rate cases  the companies have proposed a quarterly bsa 
delaware on august   dpl submitted its gas cost rate gcr filing to the delaware public service commission dpsc  which permits dpl to recover gas procurement costs through customer rates 
the proposed decrease of approximately is in anticipation of decreasing natural gas commodity costs 
on october   the dpsc issued its initial order approving the proposed rates  which became effective november   subject to refund pending final dpsc approval after evidentiary hearings 
any amounts subject to refund would be deferred  resulting in no earnings impact 
on february   dpl submitted an additional filing to the dpsc that proposed a decrease in the gcr effective april   in compliance with its gas service tariff and to ensure collections are more aligned with expenses 
dpl expects dpsc approval of the rate decrease in late march  subject to refund pending final dpsc approval after evidentiary hearings 
on august   dpl submitted an application to the dpsc for an increase in gas distribution base rates  including a proposed bsa 
the application requested an annual increase of approximately million or an overall increase of  including certain miscellaneous tariff fees  reflecting a proposed return on equity roe of 
if the bsa is not approved  the proposed annual increase would be million or an overall increase of  reflecting an roe of 
on october   the dpsc authorized dpl to place into effect beginning november   subject to refund  gas base rates designed to produce an annual interim increase in revenue of approximately million 
on february   all of the parties in this proceeding dpl  dpsc staff and the delaware division of public advocate filed a settlement agreement with the dpsc 
the settlement provisions include a million increase in distribution rates  including certain miscellaneous tarif f fees of which million was put into effect on november   as noted above  an roe of  and a change in depreciation rates that result in a million reduction in pre tax annual depreciation expense 
although the settlement agreement does not include a bsa  it provides for all of the parties to the case to participate in any generic statewide proceeding for the purpose of investigating bsa mechanisms for electric and gas distribution utilities 
in a separate proceeding  dpl has requested that a docket be opened for this purpose 
under the settlement agreement  rates will become effective on april  a dpsc decision is expected by the end of march district of columbia in february  pepco filed an update to the district of columbia generation procurement credit gpc for the periods february  through february  and february  through february  the gpc provides for sharing of the profit from sos sales 
the update to the gpc in the district of columbia takes into account the million in proceeds received by pepco from the december sale of an allowed bankruptcy claim against mirant arising from a settlement agreement entered into with mirant relating to mirant s obligation to supply energy and capacity to fulfill pepco s sos obligations in the district of columbia 
the filing also incorporates true ups to previous disbursements in the gpc for the district of columbia 
in the filing  pepco requested that million be credited to district of columbia customers during the twelve month period beginning april on june   the district of columbia public service commission dcpsc granted conditional approval of the gpc update as filed  effective july  final approval by the dcpsc is pending 
on december   pepco submitted an application to the dcpsc to increase electric distribution base rates  including a proposed bsa 
the application requested an annual increase of approximately million or an overall increase of  reflecting a proposed roe of 
if the bsa is not approved  the proposed annual increase would be million or an overall increase of  reflecting an roe of 
the application also proposed a pension opeb expense surcharge that will allow pepco to reflect in its distribution rates the increases and decreases that occur in the level of its pension and other post employment benefits expense 
a dcpsc decision is expected in mid september maryland on november   dpl and pepco each submitted an application to the maryland public service commission mpsc to increase electric distribution base rates  including a proposed bsa 
the applications requested an annual increase for dpl of approximately million or an overall increase of  including certain miscellaneous tariff fees  and an annual increase for pepco of approximately million or an overall increase of  reflecting a proposed roe for each of 
if the bsa is not approved  the proposed annual increase for dpl would be million or an overall increase of  and for pepco would be million or an overall increase of  reflecting a proposed roe for each of 
each of the applications also proposed a pension opeb expense surcharge that would allow the utility to reflect in its distribution rates the increases and decreases that occur in the level of its pension and other post employment benefits expense 
the appli cations requested that rates go into effect on december  in an order dated december   the mpsc suspended the proposed rates pending mpsc approval 
mpsc decisions are expected in june federal energy regulatory commission on may   pepco  ace and dpl updated their ferc approved formula transmission rates based on the ferc form data for for each of the utilities 
these rates became effective on june   as follows for pepco   per megawatt per year  for ace   per megawatt per year  and for dpl   per megawatt per year 
by operation of the formula rate process  the new rates incorporate true ups from the formula rates that were effective june  and the new customer demand or peak load 
also  beginning in january  the new rates will be applied to customer demand data  replacing the demand data that is currently used 
this demand component is driven by the prior year peak loads experienced in each respective zone 
further  the rate changes will be positively impacted by changes to distribution rates for pepco and dpl based on the merger settlements in maryland and the district of columbia 
the net earnings impact expected from the network transmission rate changes is estimated to be a reduction of approximately million year over year to 
ace restructuring deferral proceeding pursuant to orders issued by the njbpu under the new jersey electric discount and energy competition act edeca  beginning august   ace was obligated to provide bgs to retail electricity customers in its service territory who did not choose a competitive energy supplier 
for the period august  through july   ace s aggregate costs that it was allowed to recover from customers exceeded its aggregate revenues from supplying bgs 
these under recovered costs were partially offset by a million deferred energy cost liability existing as of july  leac liability related to ace s levelized energy adjustment clause and ace s demand side management programs 
ace established a regulatory asset in an amount equal to the balance of under recovered costs 
in august  ace filed a petition with the njbpu for the recovery of approximately million in actual and projected deferred costs relating to the provision of bgs and other restructuring related costs incurred by ace over the four year period august  through july   net of the million offset for the leac liability 
the petition also requested that ace s rates be reset as of august  so that there would be no under recovery of costs embedded in the rates on or after that date 
the increase sought represented an overall annual increase in electric rates 
in july  the njbpu issued a final order in the restructuring deferral proceeding confirming a july summary order  which i permitted ace to begin collecting a portion of the deferred costs and reset rates to recover on going costs incurred as a result of edeca  ii approved the recovery of million of the deferred balance over a ten year amortization period beginning august   iii transferred to ace s then pending base rate case for further consideration approximately million of the deferred balance the base rate case ended in a settlement approved by the njbpu in may  the result of which is that any net rate impact from the deferral account recoveries and credits in future years will depend in part on whether rates associated with other deferred accounts considered in the case continue to generate over collections relative to costs  and iv estimated the overall deferral balance as of july  at million  of which million was disallowed recovery by ace 
although ace believes the record does not justify the level of disallowance imposed by the njbpu in the final order  the million of disallowed incurred costs were reserved during the years through primarily through charges to earnings  primarily in the operating expense line item deferred electric service costs  with a corresponding reduction in the regulatory asset balance sheet account 
in august  ace filed a notice of appeal with respect to the july final order with the appellate division of the superior court of new jersey the appellate division  which hears appeals of the decisions of new jersey administrative agencies  including the njbpu 
briefs in the appeal were also filed by the division of the new jersey ratepayer advocate and by cogentrix energy inc  the co owner of two cogeneration power plants with contracts to sell ace approximately megawatts of electricity  as cross appellants between august and january the appellate division has not yet set the schedule for oral argument 
divestiture cases district of columbia final briefs on pepco s district of columbia divestiture proceeds sharing application were filed with the dcpsc in july following an evidentiary hearing in june that application was filed to implement a provision of pepco s dcpsc approved divestiture settlement that provided for a sharing of any net proceeds from the sale of pepco s generation related assets 
one of the principal issues in the case is whether pepco should be required to share with customers the excess deferred income taxes edit and accumulated deferred investment tax credits aditc associated with the sold assets and  if so  whether such sharing would violate the normalization provisions of the internal revenue code irc and its implementing regulations 
as of december   the district of columbia allocated portions of edit and aditc associated with the divested generating assets were approximately million and million  respectively 
pepco believes that a sharing of edit and aditc would violate the irs normalization rules 
under these rules  pepco could not transfer the edit and the aditc benefit to customers more quickly than on a straight line basis over the book life of the related assets 
since the assets are no longer owned there is no book life over which the edit and aditc can be returned 
if pepco were required to share edit and aditc and  as a result  the normalization rules were violated  pepco would be unable to use accelerated depreciation on district of columbia allocated or assigned property 
in addition to sharing with customers the generation related edit and aditc balances  pepco would have to pay to the irs an amount equal to pepco s district of columbia jurisdictional generation related aditc balance million as of december   as well as its district of columbia jurisdictional transmission and distribution related aditc balance million as of december  in each case as those balances exist as of the later of the date a dcpsc order is issued and all rights to appeal have been exhausted or lapsed  or the date the dcpsc order becomes operative 
in march  the irs issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nopr  which would allow for the sharing of edit and aditc related to divested assets with utility customers on a prospective basis and at the election of the taxpayer on a retroactive basis 
in december a revised nopr was issued which  among other things  withdrew the march nopr and eliminated the taxpayer s ability to elect to apply the regulation retroactively 
comments on the revised nopr were filed in march  and a public hearing was held in april pepco filed a letter with the dcpsc in january  in which it has reiterated that the dcpsc should continue to defer any decision on the aditc and edit issues until the irs issues final regulations or states that its regulations project related to this issue will be terminated without the issuance of any regulations 
other issues in the divestiture proceeding deal with the treatment of internal costs and cost allocations as deductions from the gross proceeds of the divestiture 
pepco believes that its calculation of the district of columbia customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct 
however  depending on the ultimate outcome of this proceeding  pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to district of columbia customers  including the payments described above related to edit and aditc 
such additional payments which  other than the edit and aditc related payments  cannot be estimated would be charged to expense in the quarter and year in which a final decision is rendered and could have a material adverse effect on pepco s and phi s results of operations for those periods 
however  neither phi nor pepco believes that additional gain sharing payments  if any  or the aditc related payments to the irs  if required  would have a material adverse impact on its financial position or cash flows 
maryland pepco filed its divestiture proceeds plan application with the mpsc in april the principal issue in the maryland case is the same edit and aditc sharing issue that has been raised in the district of columbia case 
see the discussion above under divestiture cases district of columbia 
as of december   the maryland allocated portions of edit and aditc associated with the divested generating assets were approximately million and million  respectively 
other issues deal with the treatment of certain costs as deductions from the gross proceeds of the divestiture 
in november  the hearing examiner in the maryland proceeding issued a proposed order with respect to the application that concluded that pepco s maryland divestiture settlement agreement provided for a sharing between pepco and customers of the edit and aditc associated with the sold assets 
pepco believes that such a sharing would violate the normalization rules discussed abo ve and would result in pepco s inability to use accelerated depreciation on maryland allocated or assigned property 
if the proposed order is affirmed  pepco would have to share with its maryland customers  on an approximately basis  the maryland allocated portion of the generation related edit million as of december   and the maryland allocated portion of generation related aditc 
furthermore  pepco would have to pay to the irs an amount equal to pepco s maryland jurisdictional generation related aditc balance million as of december   as well as its maryland retail jurisdictional aditc transmission and distribution related balance million as of december   in each case as those balances exist as of the later of the date a mpsc order is issued and all rights to appeal have been exhausted or lapsed  or the date the mpsc order becomes operative 
the hearing examiner decided all other issues in favor of pepco  except for the determination that only one half of the severance payments that pepco included in its calculation of corporate reorganization costs should be deducted from the sales proceeds before sharing of the net gain between pepco and customers 
pepco filed a letter with the mpsc in january  in which it has reiterated that the mpsc should continue to defer any decision on the aditc and edit issues until the irs issues final regulations or states that its regulations project related to this issue will be terminated without the issuance of any reg ulations 
in december  pepco appealed the hearing examiner s decision to the mpsc as it relates to the treatment of edit and aditc and corporate reorganization costs 
the mpsc has not issued any ruling on the appeal and pepco does not believe that it will do so until action is taken by the irs as described above 
however  depending on the ultimate outcome of this proceeding  pepco could be required to share with its customers approximately percent of the edit and aditc balances described above in addition to the additional gain sharing payments relating to the disallowed severance payments  which pepco is not contesting 
such additional payments would be charged to expense in the quarter and year in which a final decision is rendered and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for those periods 
however  neither phi nor pepco believes that additional gain sharing payments  if any  or the aditc related payments to the irs  if required  would have a mate rial adverse impact on its financial position or cash flows 
new jersey in connection with the divestiture by ace of its nuclear generating assets  the njbpu in july preliminarily determined that the amount of stranded costs associated with the divested assets that ace could recover from ratepayers should be reduced by approximately million  representing the amount of the accumulated deferred federal income taxes adfit associated with the divested nuclear assets 
however  due to uncertainty under federal tax law regarding whether the sharing of federal income tax benefits associated with the divested assets  including adfit  with ace s customers would violate the normalization rules  ace submitted a request to the irs for a private letter ruling plr to clarify the applicable law 
the njbpu has delayed its final determination of the amount of recoverable stranded costs until after the receipt of the plr 
on may   the irs issued a plr in which it stated that returning to ratepayers any of the unamortized adfit attributable to accelerated depreciation on the divested assets after the sale of the assets by means of a reduction of the amount of recoverable stranded costs would violate the normalization rules 
on june   ace submitted a letter to the njbpu to request that the njbpu conduct proceedings to finalize the determination of the stranded costs associated with the sale of ace s nuclear assets in accordance with the plr 
ace s request remains pending 
default electricity supply proceedings delaware effective may   sos replaced fixed rate polr service for customers who do not choose an alternative electricity supplier 
in october  the dpsc approved dpl as the sos provider to its delaware delivery customers 
dpl obtains the electricity to fulfill its sos supply obligation under contracts entered pursuant to a competitive bid procedure approved by the dpsc 
the bids received for the may   through may   period have had the effect of increasing rates significantly for all customer classes  including an average residential customer increase of  as compared to the fixed rates previously in effect 
to address this increase in rates  delaware in april enacted legislation that provides for a deferral of the financial impact on customers of the increases through a three step phase in of the rate increases  with of the increase taking effect on may   of the increase taking effect on january   and any remaining balance taking effect on june   subject to the right of customers to elect not to participate in the deferral program 
customers who do not opt out of the rate deferral program are required to pay the amounts deferred  without any interest charge  over a month period beginning january  as of december   approximately of the eligible delaware customers have opted not to participate in the deferral of the sos rates offered by dpl 
with approximately of the eligible customers participating in the phase in program  dpl anticipates a maximum deferral balance of million 
maryland pursuant to orders issued by the mpsc in november  pepco and dpl each is the sos provider to its delivery customers who do not choose an alternative electricity supplier 
each company purchases the power supply required to satisfy its sos obligations from wholesale suppliers under contracts entered into pursuant to a competitive bid procedure approved and supervised by the mpsc 
in march  pepco and dpl each announced the results of competitive bids to supply electricity to its maryland sos customers for one year beginning june  due to significant increases in the cost of fuels used to generate electricity  the auction results had the effect of increasing the average monthly electric bill by about and for pepco s and dpl s maryland residential customers  respectively 
on april   the mpsc approved a settlement agreement among pepco  dpl  the staff of the mpsc and the office of peoples counsel of maryland  which provides for a rate mitigation plan for the residential customers of each company 
under the plan  the full increase for each company s residential customers who affirmatively elect to participate are being phased in in increments of on june   on march  and the remainder on june  customers electing to participate in the rate deferral plan will be required to pay the deferred amounts over an month period beginning june  both pepco and dpl will accrue the interest cost to fund the deferral program 
the interest cost will be absorbed by pepco and dpl during the period that the deferred balance is accumulated and collected from customers  to the extent of and offset against the margins that the companies otherwise would earn for providing sos to residential customers 
as of dec ember   approximately of pepco s residential customers and approximately of dpl s residential customers had elected to participate in the phase in program 
on june   maryland enacted legislation that extended the period for customers to elect to participate in the phase in of higher rates and revised the obligation to provide sos to residential and small commercial customers until further action of the general assembly 
the legislation also provides for a customer refund reflecting the difference between the interest expense on an initially projected deferred balance at a customer participation level and the interest expense on a deferred balance based on actual participation levels referred to above 
the total amount of the refund is approximately million for pepco customers and approximately 
million for dpl customers 
at pepco s level of participation  pepco estimates that the deferral balance  net of taxes  will be approximately million 
at dpl s level of participation  dpl estimates that the deferral balance  net of taxes  will be approximately 
million 
in july  the mpsc approved revised tariff riders filed in june by pepco and dpl to implement the legislation 
virginia on march   dpl filed for a rate increase with the virginia state corporation commission vscc for its virginia default service customers to take effect on june   which was intended to allow dpl to recover its higher cost for energy established by the competitive bid procedure 
on june   the vscc issued an order that granted a rate increase for dpl of million million less than requested by dpl in its march filing  to go into effect july  in determining the amount of the approved increase  the vscc applied the proxy rate calculation to dpl s fuel factor  rather than allowing full recovery of the costs dpl incurred in procuring the supply necessary for its default service obligation 
the estimated after tax earnings and cash flow impacts of the decision are reductions of approximately million in including the loss of revenue in june associated with the default service rate increase being deferred from june un til july and million in the order also mandated that dpl file an application by march  which has been delayed until april  by subsequent vscc order for default service rates to become effective june   which should include a calculation of the fuel factor that is consistent with the procedures set forth in the order 
in february  the virginia general assembly passed amendments to the virginia electric utility restructuring act the virginia restructuring act that modified the method by which investor owned electric utilities in virginia will be regulated by the vscc 
these amendments to the virginia restructuring act  subject to further amendment or veto by the virginia governor and subsequent action by the general assembly  will be effective on july  the amendments provide that  as of december   the following will come to an end i capped rates the previous expiration date was december   ii dpl s default service obligation previously  dpl was obligated to continue to offer default service until relieved of that obligation by the vscc  and iii customer choice  except that customers with loads of megawatts or greater will continue to be able to buy from competitive suppliers  as will smaller non residential customers tha t aggregate their loads to reach the megawatt threshold and obtain vscc approval 
additionally  if an ex customer of default service wants to return to dpl as its energy supplier  it must give years notice or obtain approval of the vscc that the return is in the public interest 
in this event  the ex customer must take dpl s service at market based rates 
dpl also believes that the amendments to the virginia restructuring act will terminate  as of december   the ratemaking provisions within the memorandum of agreement entered into by dpl  the staff of the vscc and the virginia attorney general s office in the docket approving dpl s generating asset divestiture in the moa  including the application of the proxy rate calculation to dpl s fuel factor as discussed above  however  the vscc s interpretation of these provisions is not known 
it should be noted that in dpl s view  in the absence these amendments  the moa and all of its provisions including the proxy rate calculation expire on july   the vscc staff and the virginia attorney general disagree with dpl s position 
assuming the ratemaking provisions of the moa end on december  pursuant to the amended virginia restructuring act  the amendments provide that dpl shall file a rate case in and every years thereafter 
the roe to be allowed by the vscc will be set within a range  the lower of which is essentially the average of vertically integrated investor owned electric utilities in the southeast with an upper point that is basis points above that average 
the vscc has authority to set rates higher or lower to allow dpl to maintain the opportunity to earn the determined roe and to cred it back to customers  in whole or in part  earnings that were basis points or more in excess of the determined roe 
the amended virginia restructuring act includes various incentive roes for the construction of new generation and would allow the vscc to penalize or reward dpl for efficient operations or  if dpl were to add new generation  for generating unit performance 
there are also enhanced ratemaking features if dpl pursues conservation  demand management and energy efficiency programs or pursues renewable energy portfolios 
ace sale of generating assets on september   ace completed the sale of its interests in the keystone and conemaugh generating facilities to duquesne light holdings inc for approximately million  which was subsequently decreased by million based on a post closing day true up for applicable items not known at the time of the closing 
approximately million of the net gain from the sale has been used to offset the remaining regulatory asset balance  which ace has been recovering in rates  and approximately million of the net gain is being returned to ratepayers over a month period as a credit on their bills  which began with the october billing month 
the balance to be repaid to customers is million as of december  on february   ace completed the sale of the bl england generating facility to rc cape may for a price of million  after adjustment for  among other things  variances in the value of fuel and material inventories at the time of closing  plant operating capacity  the value of certain benefits for transferred employees and the actual closing date 
the purchase price will be further adjusted based on a post closing day true up for applicable items not known at the time of the closing 
in addition  rc cape may and ace have agreed to arbitration concerning whether rc cape may must pay to ace  as part of the purchase price  an additional million remaining in dispute 
rc cape may also assumed certain liabilities associated with the bl england generating station  including substantially all environmental liabilities 
this transaction is further described below under the heading environmental litigation 
the sale of bl england will not affect the stranded costs associated with the plant that already have been securitized 
ace anticipates that approximately to million of additional regulatory assets related to bl england may  subject to njbpu approval  be eligible for recovery as stranded costs 
the emission allowance credits associated with b 
l 
england will be monetized for the benefit of ace s ratepayers pursuant to the njbpu order approving the sale 
net proceeds from the sale of the plant and monetization of the emission allowance credits  which will be determined after the sale upon resolution of certain adjustments  will be credited to ace s ratepayers in accordance with the requirements of edeca and njbpu orders 
general litigation during  pepco was served with amended complaints filed in the state circuit courts of prince george s county  baltimore city and baltimore county  maryland in separate ongoing  consolidated proceedings known as in re personal injury asbestos case 
pepco and other corporate entities were brought into these cases on a theory of premises liability 
under this theory  the plaintiffs argued that pepco was negligent in not providing a safe work environment for employees or its contractors  who allegedly were exposed to asbestos while working on pepco s property 
initially  a total of approximately individual plaintiffs added pepco to their complaints 
while the pleadings are not entirely clear  it appears that each plaintiff sought million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages from each defendant 
since the initial filings in  additional individual suits have been filed against pepco  and significant numbers of cases have been dismissed 
as a result of two motions to dismiss  numerous hearings and meetings and one motion for summary judgment  pepco has had approximately of these cases successfully dismissed with prejudice  either voluntarily by the plaintiff or by the court 
as of january   there are approximately cases still pending against pepco in the state courts of maryland  of which approximately cases were filed after december   and have been tendered to mirant for defense and indemnification pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase and sale agreement 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  mirant has agreed to assume this contractual obligation 
for a description of the settlement agreement  see the discussion of the relationship with mirant above 
while the aggregate amount of monetary damages sought in the remaining suits excluding those tendered to mirant exceeds million  phi and pepco believe the amounts claimed by current plaintiffs are greatly exaggerated 
the amount of total liability  if any  and any related insurance recovery cannot be determined at this time  however  based on information and relevant circumstances known at this time  neither phi nor pepco believes these suits will have a material adverse effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  if an unfavorable decision were rendered against pepco  it could have a material adverse effect on pepco s and phi s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
cash balance plan litigation in  conectiv established a cash balance retirement plan to replace defined benefit retirement plans then maintained by ace and dpl 
following the acquisition by pepco of conectiv  this plan became the conectiv cash balance sub plan within the phi retirement plan 
on september   three management employees of phi service company filed suit in the united states district court for the district of delaware the delaware district court against the phi retirement plan  phi and conectiv the phi parties  alleging violations of erisa  on behalf of a class of management employees who did not have enough age and service when the cash balance sub plan was implemented in to assure that their accrued benefits would be calculated pursuant to the terms of the predecessor plans sponsored by ace and dpl 
a fourth plaintiff was added to the case to represent dpl heritage grandfathered employees who will not be eligible for early retirement at the end of the grandfathere d period 
the plaintiffs have challenged the design of the cash balance sub plan and are seeking a declaratory judgment that the cash balance sub plan is invalid and that the accrued benefits of each member of the class should be calculated pursuant to the terms of the predecessor plans 
specifically  the complaint alleges that the use of a variable rate to compute the plaintiffs accrued benefit under the cash balance sub plan results in reductions in the accrued benefits that violate erisa 
the complaint also alleges that the benefit accrual rates and the minimal accrual requirements of the cash balance sub plan violate erisa as did the notice that was given to plan participants upon implementation of the cash balance sub plan 
the phi parties filed a motion to dismiss the suit  which was denied by the court on july  the delaware district court stayed one count of the complaint regarding alleged age discrimination pending a decision in another case before the united states court of appeals for the third circuit the third circuit 
on january   the third circuit issued a ruling in the other case that phi s counsel believes should result in the favorable disposition of all of the claims other than the claim of inadequate notice against the phi parties in the delaware district court 
the phi parties filed pleadings apprising the delaware district court of the third circuit s decision on february   at the same time they filed their opposition to plaintiffs motion 
while phi believes it has an increasingly strong legal position in the case and that it is therefore unlikely that the plaintiffs will prevail  phi estimates that  if the plaintiffs were to prevail  the abo and projected benefit obligation pbo  calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 each would increase by approximately million  assuming no change in benefits for persons who have already retired or whose employment has been terminated and using actuarial valuation data as of the time the suit was filed 
the abo represents the present value that participants have earned as of the date of calculation 
this means that only service already worked and compensation already earned and paid is considered 
the pbo is similar to the abo  except that the pbo includes recognition of the effect that estimated future pay increases would have on the pension plan obligation 
environmental litigation phi  through its subsidiaries  is subject to regulation by various federal  regional  state  and local authorities with respect to the environmental effects of its operations  including air and water quality control  solid and hazardous waste disposal  and limitations on land use 
in addition  federal and state statutes authorize governmental agencies to compel responsible parties to clean up certain abandoned or unremediated hazardous waste sites 
phi s subsidiaries may incur costs to clean up currently or formerly owned facilities or sites found to be contaminated  as well as other facilities or sites that may have been contaminated due to past disposal practices 
although penalties assessed for violations of environmental laws and regulations are not recoverable from customers of the operating utilities  environmental clean up costs incurred by pepco  dpl and ace would be included by each company in its respective cost of service for ratemaking purposes 
in july  dpl entered into an administrative consent order aco with the maryland department of the environment mde to perform a remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs to further identify the extent of soil  sediment and ground and surface water contamination related to former manufactured gas plant mgp operations at a cambridge  maryland site on dpl owned property and to investigate the extent of mgp contamination on adjacent property 
the mde has approved the ri and dpl submitted a final fs to mde on february  the costs of cleanup as determined by the ri fs and subsequent negotiations with mde are anticipated to be approximately million 
the remedial action will include dredging activities within cambridge creek  which are expected to take place as early as october  and soil excavation on dpl s and adjacent property as early as january in the early s  both pepco and dpl sold scrap transformers  some of which may have contained some level of pcbs  to a metal reclaimer operating at the metal bank cottman avenue site in philadelphia  pennsylvania  owned by a nonaffiliated company

the utility prps will perform the remedy at the site and will be able to draw on the million from the bankruptcy settlement to accomplish the remediation the bankruptcy funds 
the utility prps will contribute funds to the extent remediation costs exceed the bankruptcy funds available 
the utility prps also will be liable for epa costs associated with overseeing the monitoring and operation of the site remedy after the remedy construction is certified to be complete and also the cost of performing the year review of site conditions required by the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of any bankruptcy funds not spent on the remedy may be used to cover the utility prps liabilities for future costs 
no parties are released from potential liability for damages to natural resources 
as of december   pepco had accrued million to meet its liability for a remedy at the metal bank cottman avenue site 
while final costs to pepco of the settlement have not been determined  pepco believes that its liability at this site will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in  dpl entered into a de minimis settlement with epa and paid approximately  to resolve its liability for cleanup costs at the metal bank cottman avenue site

in november  the njdep identified ace as a prp at the delilah road landfill site in egg harbor township  new jersey 
in  ace  along with other prps  signed an aco with njdep to remediate the site 
the soil cap remedy for the site has been completed and the njdep conditionally approved the report submitted by the parties on the implementation of the remedy in january in march  njdep approved a ground water sampling and analysis plan 
positive results of groundwater monitoring events have resulted in a reduced level of groundwater monitoring

federal tax treatment of cross border leases pci maintains a portfolio of cross border energy sale leaseback transactions  which  as of december   had a book value of approximately billion  and from which phi currently derives approximately million per year in tax benefits in the form of interest and depreciation deductions 
on february   the treasury department and irs issued notice informing taxpayers that the irs intends to challenge on various grounds the purported tax benefits claimed by taxpayers entering into certain sale leaseback transactions with tax indifferent parties ie  municipalities  tax exempt and governmental entities  including those entered into on or prior to march  the notice 
all of pci s cross border energy leases are with tax indifferent parties and were entered into prior to in addition  on june  the irs published a coordinated issue paper concerning the resolution of audit issues related to such transactions 
pci s cross border energy leases are similar to those sale leaseback transactions described in the notice and the coordinated issue paper 
pci s leases have been under examination by the irs as part of the normal phi tax audit 
on june   the irs issued its final revenue agent s report rar for its audit of phi s and income tax returns 
in the rar  the irs disallowed the tax benefits claimed by phi with respect to these leases for those years 
the tax benefits claimed by phi with respect to these leases from through december  were approximately million 
phi has filed a protest against the irs adjustments and the unresolved audit has been forwarded to the appeals office 
the ultimate outcome of this issue is uncertain  however  if the irs prevails  phi would be subject to additional taxes  along with interest and possibly penalties on the additional taxes  which could have a material adverse effect on phi s financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
phi believes that its tax position related to these transactions was appropriate based on applicable statutes  regulations and case law  and intends to contest the adjustments proposed by the irs  however  there is no assurance that phi s position will prevail 
on july   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp on financial accounting standards fas  which amends sfas no 
effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this amendment requires a lease to be repriced and the book value adjusted when there is a change or probable change in the timing of tax benefits of the lease regardless of whether the change results in a deferral or permanent loss of tax benefits 
accordingly  a material change in the timing of cash flows under phi s cross border leases as the result of a settlement with the irs would require an adjustment to the book value of the leases and a charge to earnings equal to the repricing impact of the disallowed deductions which could result in a material adverse effect on phi s financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
phi believes its tax position was appropriate and at this time does not believe there is a probable change in the timing of its tax benefits that would require repricing the leases and a charge to earnings 
on february  the us senate passed the small business and work opportunity act of included in this legislation is a provision which would apply passive loss limitation rules to leases with foreign tax indifferent parties effective for taxable years beginning after december   even if the leases were entered into on or prior to march  on february   the us house of representatives passed the small business relief act of this bill does not include any provision that would modify the current treatment of leases with tax indifferent parties 
enactment into law of a bill that is similar to that passed by the us senate in its current form could result in a material delay of the income tax benefits that pci would receive in connection with its cross border energy leases 
furthermore  under fsp fas  phi would be required to adjust the book values of its leases and record a charge to earnings equal to the repricing impact of th e disallowed deductions which could result in a material adverse effect on phi s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the us house of representatives and the us senate are expected to hold a conference in the near future to reconcile the differences in the two bills to determine the final legislation 
irs mixed service cost issue during  pepco  dpl  and ace changed their methods of accounting with respect to capitalizable construction costs for income tax purposes 
the change allowed the companies to accelerate the deduction of certain expenses that were previously capitalized and depreciated 
through december   these accelerated deductions generated incremental tax cash flow benefits of approximately million consisting of million for pepco  million for dpl  and million for ace for the companies  primarily attributable to their tax returns 
on august   the treasury department released regulations that  if adopted in their current form  would require pepco  dpl  and ace to change their method of accounting with respect to capitalizable construction costs for income tax purposes for tax periods beginning in based on those regulations  phi in its federal tax return adopted an alternative method of accounting for capitalizable construction costs that management believes will be acceptable to the irs 
on the same day that the new regulations were released  the irs issued revenue ruling  which is intended to limit the ability of certain taxpayers to utilize the method of accounting for income tax purposes they utilized on their tax returns for and prior years with respect to capitalizable construction costs 
in line with this revenue ruling  the irs rar for the and tax returns disallowed substantially all of the incremental tax benefits that pepco  dpl and ace had claimed on those returns by requiring the companies to capitalize and depreciate certain expenses rather than treat such expenses as current deductions 
phi s protest of the irs adjustments is among the unresolved audit matters relating to the and audits pending before the appeals office 
in february  phi paid approximately million of taxes to cover the amount of taxes that management estimated to be payable based on the method of tax accounting that phi  pursuant to the proposed regulations  has adopted on its tax return 
however  if the irs is successful in requiring pepco  dpl and ace to capitalize and depreciate construction costs that result in a tax and interest assessment greater than management s estimate of million  phi will be required to pay additional taxes and interest only to the extent these adjustments exceed the million payment made in february irs examination of like kind exchange transaction in  conectiv and certain of its subsidiaries the conectiv group were divesting nonstrategic electric generating facilities and replacing these facilities with mid merit electric generating capacity 
as part of this strategy  the conectiv group exchanged its interests in two older coal fired plants for the more efficient gas fired hay road ii generating facility  which was owned by an unaffiliated third party 
for tax purposes  conectiv treated the transaction as a like kind exchange under irc section as a result  approximately million of taxable gain was deferred for federal income tax purposes 
the transaction was examined by the irs as part of the normal conectiv tax audit 
in may  the irs issued its rar for the audit of conectiv s  and income tax returns 
in the rar  the irs exam team disallowed the qualification of the exchange under irc section in july  conectiv filed a protest of this disallowance to the irs office of appeals 
phi believes that its tax position related to this transaction is proper based on applicable statutes  regulations and case law and intends to vigorously contest the disallowance 
however  there is no absolute assurance that conectiv s position will prevail 
if the irs prevails  conectiv would be subject to additional income taxes  interest and possible penalties 
however  a portion of the denied benefit would be offset by additional tax depreciation 
as of december   if the irs fully prevails  the potential cash impact on phi would be current income tax and interest payments of approximately million and the earnings impact would be approximately million in after tax interest 
critical accounting policies general the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates represent those estimates and assumptions that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and that have a material impact on financial condition or operating performance 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as statement of position  disclosure of certain significant risks and uncertainties  requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
examples of significant estimates used by pepco holdings include the assessment of contingencies and the need amount for reserves of future receipts from mirant see relationship with mirant corporation  the calculation of future cash flows and fair value amounts for use in goodwill and asset impairment evaluations  fair value calculations based on estimated market pricing associated with derivative instruments  pension and other postretirement benefits assumptions  unbilled revenue calculations  and the judgment involved with assessing the probability of recovery of regulatory assets 
additionally  phi is subject to legal  regulatory  and other proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
pepco holdings records an estimated liability for these proceedings and claims based upon the probable and reasonably estimable criteria contained in sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
although pepco holdings believes that its estimates and assu mptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available to management at the time the estimates are made 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
goodwill impairment evaluation pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in its goodwill impairment evaluation process represent critical accounting estimates because i they may be susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about the discounting of future cash flows  which are inherently uncertain  ii actual results could vary from those used in pepco holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and iii the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on pepco holdings assets and the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material 
the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  require the evaluation of goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
sfas no 
indicates that if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  including goodwill  an impairment charge may be necessary 
the goodwill generated in the transaction by which pepco acquired conectiv in was allocated to pepco holdings power delivery segment 
in order to estimate the fair value of its power delivery segment  pepco holdings discounts the estimated future cash flows associated with the segment using a discounted cash flow model with a single interest rate that is commensurate with the risk involved with such an investment 
the estimation of fair value is dependent on a number of factors  including but not limited to interest rates  future growth assumptions  operating and capital expenditu re requirements and other factors  changes in which could materially impact the results of impairment testing 
pepco holdings tested its goodwill for impairment as of july  this testing concluded that pepco holdings goodwill balance was not impaired 
a hypothetical decrease in the power delivery segment s forecasted cash flows of percent would not have resulted in an impairment charge 
long lived assets impairment evaluation pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in its long lived asset impairment evaluation process represent critical accounting estimates because i they are highly susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about undiscounted and discounted future cash flows and fair values  which are inherently uncertain  ii actual results could vary from those used in pepco holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and iii the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on pepco holdings assets as well as the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that certain long lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss may only be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the asset is deemed not to be recoverable when its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
in order to estimate an asset s future cash flows  pepco holdings considers historical cash flows 
pepco holdings uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors  including forward price curves for energy  fuel costs  legislative initiatives  and operating costs 
the process of determining fair value is done consistent with the process described in assessing the fair val ue of goodwill  which is discussed above 
for a discussion of phi s impairment losses during  refer to the impairment losses section in the accompanying consolidated results of operations discussion 
derivative instruments pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in accounting for its derivative instruments represent critical accounting estimates because i the fair value of the instruments are highly susceptible to changes in market value and or interest rate fluctuations  ii there are significant uncertainties in modeling techniques used to measure fair value in certain circumstances  iii actual results could vary from those used in pepco holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and iv changes in fair values and market prices could result in material impacts to pepco holdings assets  liabilities  other comprehensive income loss  and results of operations 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies accounting for derivatives to the consolidated financial statements of phi included in item for information on phi s accounting for derivatives 
pepco holdings and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments primarily to manage risk associated with commodity prices and interest rates 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  governs the accounting treatment for derivatives and requires that derivative instruments be measured at fair value 
the fair value of derivatives is determined using quoted exchange prices where available 
for instruments that are not traded on an exchange  external broker quotes are used to determine fair value 
for some custom and complex instruments  an internal model is used to interpolate broker quality price information 
the same valuation methods are used to determine the value of non derivative  commodity exposure for risk management purposes 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in reporting the costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefits represent critical accounting estimates because i they are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of assumptions which are subjective in nature  ii they are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience  and iii changes in assumptions could impact pepco holdings expected future cash funding requirements for the plans and would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations  the reported pension and other postretirement benefit liability on the balance sheet  and the reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost on the income statement 
in terms of quantifying the anticipated impact of a change in assumptions  pepco holdings estimates that a 
change in the discount rate used to value the benefit obligations could result in a million impact on its consolidated balance sheets and statements of earnings 
additionally  pepco holdings estimates that a 
change in the expected return on plan assets could result in a million impact on the consolidated balance sheets and statements of earnings and a 
change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate could result in a 
million impact on its consolidated balance sheets and statements of earnings 
pepco holdings management consults with its actuaries and investment consultants when selecting its plan assumptions 
pepco holdings follows the guidance of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas no 
 when accounting for these benefits 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
in accordance with these standards  the impact of changes in these assumptions and the difference between actual and expected or estimated results on pension and postretirement obligations is generally recognized over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans rather than immediately recognized in the statements of earnings 
plan assets are stated at their market value as of the measurement date  which is december regulation of power delivery operations the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  apply to the power delivery businesses of pepco  dpl  and ace 
pepco holdings believes that the judgment involved in accounting for its regulated activities represent critical accounting estimates because i a significant amount of judgment is required including but not limited to the interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders to assess the probability of the recovery of regulatory assets  ii actual results and interpretations could vary from those used in pepco holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and iii the impact that writing off a regulatory asset would have on pepco holdings assets and the net loss related to the charge could be material 
unbilled revenue unbilled revenue represents an estimate of revenue earned from services rendered by pepco holdings utility operations that have not yet been billed 
pepco holdings utility operations calculate unbilled revenue using an output based methodology 
this methodology is based on the supply of electricity or gas distributed to customers 
pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in its unbilled revenue process represent critical accounting estimates because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about input factors such as customer sales mix and estimated power line losses estimates of electricity expected to be lost in the process of its transmission and distribution to customers  all of which are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change from period to period  the impact of which could be material

fsp fas  accounting for a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction on july   the fasb issued fsp fas  accounting for a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction fsp fas 
fsp fas  which amends sfas no

fsp fas will not be effective until the first fiscal year beginning after december  year ending december  for pepco holdings 
a material change in the timing of cash flows under phi s cross border leases as the result of a settlement with the internal revenue service or a change in tax law would require an adjustment to the book value of the leases and a charge to earnings equal to the repricing impact of the disallowed deductions which could result in a material adverse effect on phi s financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows

other income expenses other expenses increased by million to a net expense of million in  from a net expense of million in the increase is primarily due to i million increase in interest expense related to ace s deferred electric service costs regulated liability  and ii million increase due to the contribution in aid of construction tax gross up 
income tax expense ace s effective tax rate  excluding discontinued operations  for the year ended december   was as compared to the federal statutory rate of 
the effects of state income taxes net of federal benefit were offset by changes in estimates related to tax liabilities of prior tax years subject to audit which is the primary reason for the decrease in the effective rate as compared to and the flow through of deferred investment tax credits 
ace s effective tax rate  before extraordinary item and excluding discontinued operations for the year ended december   was as compared to the federal statutory rate of 
the major reasons for this difference were state income taxes net of federal benefit  the flow through of certain book tax depreciation differences and changes in estimates related to tax liabilities of prior tax years subject to audit primarily due to the mixed service cost issue under internal revenue service rule  partially offset by the flow through of deferred investment tax credits 
extraordinary item as a result of the april settlement of ace s electric distribution rate case  ace reversed million in accruals related to certain deferred costs that are now deemed recoverable 
the after tax credit to income of million is classified as an extraordinary gain in the financial statements since the original accrual was part of an extraordinary charge in conjunction with the accounting for competitive restructuring in forward looking statements some of the statements contained in this annual report on form k are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and are subject to the safe harbor created by the private securities litigation reform act of these statements include declarations regarding ace s intents  beliefs and current expectations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management policies for phi and its subsidiaries are determined by phi s corporate risk management committee  the members of which are phi s chief risk officer  chief operating officer  chief financial officer  general counsel  chief information officer and other senior executives 
the corporate risk management committee monitors interest rate fluctuation  commodity price fluctuation  and credit risk exposure  and sets risk management policies that establish limits on unhedged risk and determine risk reporting requirements 
pepco holdings  inc commodity price risk the competitive energy segments actively engage in commodity risk management activities to reduce their financial exposure to changes in the value of their assets and obligations due to commodity price fluctuations 
certain of these risk management activities are conducted using instruments classified as derivatives under sfas no 
the competitive energy segments also manage commodity risk with contracts that are not classified as derivatives 
the competitive energy segments primary risk management objectives are to manage the spread between the cost of fuel used to operate their electric generation plants and the revenue received from the sale of the power produced by those plants by selling forward a portion of their projected plant output and buying forward a portion of their projected fuel supply requirements and to manage the spread between retail sales commitments and the cost of supply used to service those commitments in order to ensure stable and know n minimum cash flows and fix favorable prices and margins when they become available 
phi s risk management policies place oversight at the senior management level through the corporate risk management committee which has the responsibility for establishing corporate compliance requirements for the competitive energy businesses energy market participation 
phi collectively refers to these energy market activities  including its commodity risk management activities  as other energy commodity activities and identifies this activity separately from that of the discontinued proprietary trading activity 
phi uses a value at risk var model to assess the market risk of its competitive energy segments energy commodity activities 
phi also uses other measures to limit and monitor risk in its commodity activities  including limits on the nominal size of positions and periodic loss limits 
var represents the potential mark to market loss on energy contracts or portfolios due to changes in market prices for a specified time period and confidence level 
phi esti mates var using a delta gamma variance covariance model with a percent  one tailed confidence level and assuming a one day holding period 
since var is an estimate  it is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
value at risk associated with energy contracts for the year ended december  millions of dollars proprietary trading var var for competitive energy activity confidence level  one day holding period  one tailed period end average for the period high low notes this column represents all energy derivative contracts  normal purchase and sales contracts  modeled generation output and fuel requirements and modeled customer load obligations for the ongoing other energy commodity activities 
for additional quantitative and qualitative information on the fair value of energy contracts see note use of derivatives in energy and interest rate hedging activities to the consolidated financial statements of pepco holdings included in item a significant portion of the conectiv energy s portfolio of electric generating plants consists of mid merit assets and peaking assets 
mid merit electric generating plants are typically combined cycle units that can quickly change their megawatt output level on an economic basis 
these plants are generally operated during times when demand for electricity rises and power prices are higher 
conectiv energy economically hedges both the estimated plant output and fuel requirements as the estimated levels of output and fuel needs change 
economic hedge percentages include the estimated electricity output of conectiv energy s generation plants and any associated financial or physical commodity contracts including derivative contracts that are classified as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 other derivative instruments  wholesale normal purchase and sales contracts  and load service obligations 
conectiv energy maintains a forward month program with targeted ranges for economically hedging its projected on peak plant output combined with its on peak energy purchase commitments based on the then current forward electricity price curve as follows month target range the primary purpose of the risk management program is to improve the predictability and stability of margins by selling forward a portion of its projected plant output  and buying forward a portion of its projected fuel supply requirements 
within each period  hedged percentages can vary significantly above or below the average reported percentages 
as of december   the electricity sold forward by conectiv energy as a percentage of projected on peak plant output combined with on peak energy purchase commitments was   and for the month  month and month forward periods  respectively 
these hedge percentages were above the target ranges for the month and month periods due to conectiv energy s success in the default electricity supply auctions and a decrease in projected on peak plant output since the forward sale commitments were entered into 
the amount of forward on peak sales during the month period represents only of conectiv energy s combined total on peak generating capability and on peak energy purchase commitments 
the volumetric percentages for the forward periods can vary and may not represent the amount of expected value hedged 
not all of the value associated with conectiv energy s generation activities can be hedged such as the portion attributable to ancillary services and fuel switching due to the lack of market products  market liquidity  and other factors 
also the hedging of locational value and capacity can be limited 
credit and nonperformance risk pepco holdings subsidiaries attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to wholesale energy counterparties through  among other things  formal credit policies  regular assessment of counterparty creditworthiness and the establishment of a credit limit for each counterparty  monitoring procedures that include stress testing  the use of standard agreements which allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty and collateral requirements under certain circumstances  and has established reserves for credit losses 
as of december   credit exposure to wholesale energy counterparties was weighted with investment grade counterparties  with counterparties without external credit quality ratings  and with non investment grade counterparties 
this table provides information on the competitive energy businesses credit exposure  net of collateral  to wholesale counterparties 
schedule of credit risk exposure on competitive wholesale energy contracts millions of dollars december  rating exposure before credit collateral credit collateral net exposure number of counterparties greater than net exposure of counterparties greater than investment grade non investment grade no external ratings credit reserves investment grade primarily determined using publicly available credit ratings of the counterparty 
if the counterparty has provided a guarantee by a higher rated entity eg  its parent  it is determined based upon the rating of its guarantor 
included in investment grade are counterparties with a minimum standard poor s or moody s investor service rating of bbb or baa  respectively 
exposure before credit collateral includes the marked to market mtm energy contract net assets for open unrealized transactions  the net receivable payable for realized transactions and net open positions for contracts not subject to mtm 
amounts due from counterparties are offset by liabilities payable to those counterparties to the extent that legally enforceable netting arrangements are in place 
thus  this column presents the net credit exposure to counterparties after reflecting all allowable netting  but before considering collateral held
