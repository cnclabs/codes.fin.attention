item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business strategy cintas provides highly specialized products and services to businesses of all types throughout the united states and canada 
we refer to ourselves as the service professionals 
we bring value to our customers by helping them provide a cleaner  safer  more pleasant atmosphere for their customers and employees 
our products and services are designed to improve our customers image 
we also help our customers protect their employees and their company by enhancing workplace safety and helping to ensure legal compliance in key areas of their business 
we are north america s leading provider of corporate identity uniforms through rental and sales programs  as well as a significant provider of related business services  including entrance mats  restroom products and services  first aid  safety and fire protection products and services  document management services and branded promotional products 
our business strategy is to achieve revenue growth for all of our products and services by increasing our penetration at existing customers and by broadening our customer base to include business segments to which cintas has not historically served 
we will also continue to identify additional product and service opportunities for our current and future customers 
our long term goal is to provide a product or service to every business in north america 
to pursue the strategy of increasing penetration  we have a highly talented and diverse team of service professionals visiting our customers on a regular basis 
this frequent contact with our customers enables us to develop close personal relationships 
the combination of our distribution system and these strong customer relationships provides a platform from which we launch additional products and services 
we pursue the strategy of broadening our customer base in a few ways 
cintas has a national sales organization introducing all of our products and services to prospects in all business segments 
our ever expanding range of products and services allows our sales organization to consider any type of business a prospect 
we also broaden our customer base through geographic expansion  especially in our emerging businesses of first aid and safety  fire protection and document management 
finally  we will continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise 
continuous cost containment and product and process innovation are considered hallmarks of our organization 
in order to sustain these efforts  we employ a six sigma effort within cintas 
six sigma is an analytical process that assists companies in improving quality and customer satisfaction while reducing cycle time and operating costs 
we are pleased with our progress in this endeavor and are optimistic about the improved efficiencies that this process will continue to yield to cintas 
results of operations fiscal marked the th consecutive year of uninterrupted growth in sales and profits for cintas 
in addition to achieving this milestone  cintas increased its diluted earnings per share by and its dividends paid to shareholders by 
during fiscal  we reorganzied our sales efforts to become more efficient and productive 
this reorganization effort has taken longer and been more costly in fiscal than anticipated 
however  cintas continues to believe that this reorganization will benefit revenue growth results in the long term 
cintas classifies its businesses into two operating segments  rentals and other services  based on the similar economic and organizational characteristics of the products and services within each segment 
the rentals segment reflects the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments  mats  mops and shop towels 
in addition to these rental items  we also provide our restroom and hygiene products and services within this segment 
the other services segment consists of the direct sale of uniforms and related items  first aid  safety and fire protection products and services  document management services and branded promotional products 
both segments provide these products and services throughout the united states and canada to businesses of all types from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people

see note entitled significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements 
as evidenced above  our revenue growth continues to be higher in the other services segment versus the rentals segment  resulting in a moderate shift in the percentage of revenue between our segments 
this shift was mainly driven by the acquisitions of first aid  safety and fire protection businesses and document management businesses 
information related to acquisitions is discussed in note entitled acquisitions of notes to consolidated financial statements 
fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal total revenue was billion  an increase of over fiscal internal growth was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal this decline in internal growth is due to economic pressure experienced throughout the year from the continued off shoring of manufacturing jobs as well as the ripple effect felt at other customers that serve these manufacturing businesses 
in addition  the reorganization of our sales force has taken longer in the current year than we anticipated 
our internal growth continues to be generated mainly through the sale of uniform rental programs to new customers and the increased penetration of ancillary products to our existing customer base 
the remaining growth in total revenue was generated predominantly through acquisitions of rental  first aid  safety and fire protection service businesses and document management businesses 
information related to acquisitions is discussed in note entitled acquisitions of notes to consolidated financial statements 
rentals segment revenues consist predominantly of revenues derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms and other garments  and the rental and or sale of mats  mops  shop towels  restroom supplies and other rental services 
revenue from the rentals segment increased over fiscal internal growth for the rentals segment was in fiscal the increase in the rentals segment revenue was primarily due to growth in the customer base as well as the continued penetration of ancillary products into our existing customer base 
new business remained the main driver of our internal growth as we continued to sell rental programs to new customers 
we also continued to expand our rental market  with over half of our new business being comprised of customers who were first time users of uniform rental programs 
the remaining growth of in fiscal resulted from the acquisition of rental volume

cost of rentals increased over fiscal cost of rentals consists primarily of production expenses  delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory  including uniforms  mats  shop towels and other rental items 
the cost increase over fiscal was primarily driven by the growth in rentals segment revenues

as a result  cost of rentals as a percent of rentals segment revenues increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal cost of other services increased over fiscal cost of other services consists primarily of cost of goods sold predominantly uniforms and first aid products  delivery expenses and distribution expenses 
the increase over fiscal was due to the growth in other services revenue  derived through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions 
gross margin within this segment may fluctuate depending on the type of product or service sold  as more cost efficient sourcing is employed and as products which require additional services or specialization generate higher gross margins 
for example  tailored garments that incorporate high levels of design and customization tend to generate higher gross margins than work wear and standard catalog items 
the gross margin for fiscal is 
the gross margin for the other services segment has historically been in the to range 
however  a combination of economies of scale at growing operations  six sigma  sourcing improvements and other cost containment initiatives have allowed us to exceed this historical range 
due to the success of these initiatives and our continued efforts  we believe the future gross margins will be in the to range 
selling and administrative expenses increased over fiscal selling and administrative expenses increased mainly due to higher selling expenses 
in fiscal  we reorganized our sales efforts to become more efficient and productive in the long term 
this reorganization  as well as increased marketing plans and sales promotions  combined to increase our selling costs by million over the prior fiscal year

this forward starting swap is explained in more detail in the liquidity and capital resources section below

this increase was primarily a result of increased interest expense from higher debt outstanding as a result of our share buybacks

as a result  cost of rentals as of percent of rentals segment revenues remained at in both fiscal and fiscal increases in energy costs will continue to impact our results of operations negatively in coming quarters  except to the extent we are able to offset such costs with price increases and increased operating efficiencies 
our new orleans rental operation and gulf coast direct sale business continue to be impacted negatively by hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
while physical damage to our facilities was minimal  many of our customers in the region have yet to reopen or to return to pre hurricane staffing levels 
this lower business volume will continue to have an impact on our results 
we are actively pursuing recoupment of our losses related to these hurricanes with our insurance carrier 
we do not yet have a clear indication of when a recoupment agreement will be resolved  nor can we be sure of the amount we will receive

return on average equity was in fiscal and in fiscal return on average equity is computed as net income divided by the average of shareholders equity 
we believe that this calculation gives management and shareholders a good indication of cintas historical performance 
liquidity and capital resources at may   cintas had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  representing a decrease of million from may   or 
this decrease is primarily due to acquisitions and the share buyback program 
cash generated from operations was million in fiscal as compared to million generated in fiscal this million decrease was primarily due to increased inventory levels and increased taxes paid  offset by increased net income and lower rental items in service 
significant uses of cash in fiscal were capital expenditures of million  acquisitions of million net of cash acquired  repurchases of common stock of million and dividends of million 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be used to finance future acquisitions  capital expenditures  expansion and share buybacks 
marketable securities consist primarily of municipal bonds and federal government securities 
cintas investment policy pertaining to marketable securities is conservative 
the criteria used in making investment decisions is the preservation of principal  while earning an attractive yield 
accounts receivable increased million  primarily due to increased revenues 
the average collection period in fiscal remained comparable with fiscal inventories increased million  or 
inventory levels at may   were relatively low due to strong uniform sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in inventory from may  to may   reflects a replenishment of inventory to more normalized levels 
working capital decreased million to million in fiscal this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in marketable securities for the execution of the share buyback program 
net property and equipment increased by million due to continued investment in rental facilities and equipment and real estate purchased in conjunction with the acquisitions of rental  first aid  safety and fire protection and document management businesses 
capital expenditures for fiscal totaled million  including million for the rentals segment and million for the other services segment  exceeding depreciation expense by approximately million 
cintas continues to reinvest in land  buildings and equipment in an effort to expand capacity for future growth

long term debt also includes million of ten year senior notes at a rate of which was borrowed in order to finance the omni acquisition in fiscal and million of thirty year senior notes issued in august at a rate of 
proceeds from the thirty year senior notes issuance were used to extinguish outstanding commercial paper at the time of that debt issuance 
cintas has earned credit ratings on these notes of a from standard poor s and a from moody s 
in addition  long term debt also includes million in commercial paper 
cintas utilizes a million commercial paper program  on which it has earned credit ratings of a from standard poor s and prime from moody s 
we believe these ratings are reflective of our commitment to conservative financial policies  strong financial management and a disciplined integration strategy for acquisitions 
the commercial paper program is fully supported by a long term credit facility that matures in fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  cintas entered into a forward starting swap to protect forecasted interest payments from interest rate movement in anticipation of a million  year debt issuance in early fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  cintas changed its intent on issuing this year debt 
this decision was based on current market conditions and interest rate environment as well as the additional payment flexibility provided to cintas under its commercial paper program 
as a result of this decision  cintas terminated the forward starting swap and recorded the resulting million gain in fiscal as a reduction of administrative expenses 
cintas total debt to capitalization ratio has increased from at may   to at may  total debt increased million in fiscal through the net activity of debt issuance noted above see note entitled long term debt and note entitled acquisitions of notes to consolidated financial statements

while environmental compliance is not a material component of our costs  cintas must incur capital expenditures and associated operating costs  primarily for water treatment and waste removal  on a regular basis 
environmental spending related to water treatment and waste removal was approximately million in fiscal and fiscal capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances were approximately million in fiscal and fiscal these expenditures were primarily related to the purchase of water treatment systems  which are depreciated over a useful life of ten years

new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  cintas will adopt this interpretation on june   and is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of fin on its consolidated financial statements 
any necessary transition adjustments will not affect net income in the period of adoption and will be reported as a change in accounting principle in our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of cintas consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with note entitled significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements 
significant changes  estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition rental revenue is recognized when services are performed and other services revenue is recognized when either services are performed or when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts cintas establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts 
this allowance is an estimate based on historical rates of collectibility 
an uncollectible accounts provision is recorded for overdue amounts  beginning with a nominal percentage and increasing substantially as the account ages 
the amount provided as the account ages will differ slightly between the rentals and other services segments  because of differences in customers served and the nature of each segment 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
substantially all inventories represent finished goods 
cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual to standard costs to the inventory balances 
the judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or market 
inventory obsolescence is determined by specific identification  as well as an estimate based on historical rates of obsolescence 
uniforms and other rental items in service uniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization  calculated using the straight line method 
uniforms in service other than cleanroom and flame resistant garments are amortized over their useful life of eighteen months 
other rental items including shop towels  mats  cleanroom garments  flame resistant garments  linens and restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives which range from eight to forty eight months 
the amortization rates used are based on industry experience  cintas experience and wear tests performed by cintas 
these factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory that is presented in the consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which is typically thirty to forty years for buildings  five to twenty years for building improvements  three to ten years for equipment and two to five years for leasehold improvements 
when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable  the estimated future cash flows undiscounted are compared to the carrying amount of the assets 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment loss is recorded 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the assets with their carrying amounts 
fair value is determined by discounted cash flows or appraised values  as appropriate 
long lived assets that are held for disposal are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value  less estimated costs related to disposition 
goodwill and impairment goodwill  obtained through acquisitions of businesses  is valued at cost less any impairment 
cintas performs annual impairment tests by segment 
these tests include comparisons to current market values  where available  and discounted cash flow analyses 
significant assumptions include growth rates based on historical trends and margin improvement leveraged from such growth 
based on the results of the impairment tests  cintas has not recognized an impairment of goodwill for the years ended may   or service contracts and other assets service contracts and other assets  which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses  are amortized by use of the straight line method over the estimated lives of the agreements  which are generally five to ten years 
certain noncompete agreements  as well as all service contracts  require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model 
the assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates  among other factors 
because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets  actual results over time could vary from original estimates 
impairment of service contracts and other assets is through specific identification 
no impairment has been recognized by cintas for the years ended may   or stock based compensation at may   cintas had an equity compensation plan  which is more fully described in note entitled stock based compensation of notes to consolidated financial statements 
prior to june   cintas accounted for this plan under the intrinsic value method proscribed by apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by fasb statement no 
fas  accounting for stock based compensation 
effective june   cintas adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
r fas r  share based payment  using the modified retrospective transition method 
under that transition method  all prior periods have been restated based on the amounts previously calculated in the pro forma footnote disclosures required by fas fas r requires all share based payments to employees  including stock options  to be recognized as an expense in the consolidated statement of income based on their fair values 
due to this restatement  cintas income before income taxes and net income decreased by million for the year ended may   and million for the year ended may  this adoption lowered basic earnings per share from per share to per share for fiscal and from per share to per share for fiscal in addition  diluted earnings per share were lowered from per share to per share for fiscal and from per share to per share for fiscal the cumulative effect of the change on paid in capital and retained earnings as of june   was  and  respectively 
the cumulative effect of the change on deferred taxes as of june   was less than million 
as a result of adopting fas r on june   cintas income before income taxes and net income for the year ended may   are million and million lower  respectively  than if cintas had continued to account for share based compensation under apb basic and diluted earnings per share are both 
lower for the year ended may   than if cintas had continued to account for share based compensation under apb litigation and environmental matters cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims related to environmental matters arising from the ordinary course of business 
us generally accepted accounting principles require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability  as well as the amount to be recorded 
cintas regularly consults with attorneys to ensure that all of the relevant facts and circumstances are considered before a contingent liability is recorded 
while a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities  cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 
a detailed discussion of litigation matters is discussed above in the section entitled litigation and other contingencies 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
please reference note entitled income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes 
deferred income taxes that are not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting are classified according to the expected reversal date 
cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
as a result of this review  cintas has not established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions  cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate 
based on cintas evaluation of current tax positions  cintas believes its accruals are appropriate 
outlook our outlook is positive for fiscal in fiscal  we reorganized our sales efforts to become more efficient and productive 
although this reorganization has taken longer and been more costly than anticipated  we expect to see revenue growth benefits in fiscal and continued benefit over the long term 
we will continue searching out additional products and services to become an even more valuable resource for our customers 
we believe that the high level of customer service provided by our partners and supported by our infrastructure  quality products  financial resources and corporate culture will provide for continued business success 
as such  we see upside potential for all of our business units 
although difficult to predict  we anticipate continued growth in all of our business units 
in the marketplace  competition and related pricing pressure will continue  however  we believe cost containment initiatives  technological advances and continued leverage of our infrastructure will soften or offset any impact 
when appropriate opportunities arise  we will supplement our internal growth with strategic acquisitions 
like most other companies  we experienced  and anticipate continuing to experience  increased costs for wages and benefits  including medical benefits 
changes in energy costs and changes in federal and state tax laws also impact our results 
cintas continues to be the target of a corporate unionization campaign by unite here and the teamsters unions 
these unions are attempting to pressure cintas into surrendering our employees rights to a government supervised election and unilaterally accept union representation 
cintas philosophy in regard to unions is straightforward we believe that employees have the right to say yes to union representation and the freedom to say no 
this campaign could be materially disruptive to our business and could materially adversely affect results of operations 
we will continue to vigorously oppose this campaign and to defend our employees rights 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk cintas manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable and fixed rate debt and investing in marketable securities 
earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates due to the use of commercial paper of approximately million  with an average interest rate of 
this exposure is limited by the investment in marketable securities  which act as a hedge against variability in short term rates 
if short term rates change by one half percent or basis points  cintas income before income taxes would change by approximately million 
this estimated exposure considers the mitigating effects of marketable securities on the change in the cost of variable rate debt 
this analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in cintas capital structure 
through its foreign operations  cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk 
foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars 
the primary foreign currency to which cintas is exposed is the canadian dollar 
cintas does not currently use forward exchange contracts to limit potential losses in earnings or cash flows from foreign currency exchange rate movements
