overview this overview discusses matters on which our management primarily focuses in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance 
generation of revenue 
we generate the vast majority of our revenue from sales of our data protection appliances 
the balance of our revenue is provided by selling spare parts  rendering services to our customers and earning royalties on our licensed technology 
historically  most of our product sales have been made through private label arrangements with oems  and the remainder have been made through commercial distributors  dmrs and vars in our branded channel 
however  our strategy moving forward is to focus heavily on the delivery of new products to our branded channel  which historically has produced higher gross margins in comparison to oem business 
declining sales to hp 
in august  our largest oem customer  hewlett packard company hp  notified us that it had selected an alternate supplier for its next generation mid range tape automation products 
hp began purchasing the first product of this new line from the alternate supplier during the first quarter of calendar year although hp will continue to purchase the tape automation products currently supplied by us for some time  the alternate supplier s product will eventually replace a significant portion of those purchases 
although we believe that sales to hp will continue to decline through fiscal  hp has recently relaunched the tape automation products supplied by us with support for the new lto tape drives and this may slow the rate of replacement of our supplied products by the alternate supplier s product 
recent setbacks 
during fiscal  we experienced significant setbacks related to the outsourcing of our manufacturing to sanmina sci corporation sanmina  our supply contract with dell computer dell  and the commercialization of the technology we acquired from zetta systems  inc zetta in september  we announced our plan to outsource all of our manufacturing to sanmina  a us third party manufacturer 
we completed this transfer in august during fiscal  however  we failed to achieve the customer service levels  product quality and cost reductions we expected from the outsourcing 
additionally  we incurred a significant amount of redundant costs to support the outsourcing  which eroded our gross margins during the year 
consequently  we decided to bring manufacturing back to our san diego facility and entered into a transition agreement with sanmina effective september in february  we completed the transfer of all production lines back to san diego 
in october  we were notified by dell of its intent to terminate the supply agreement under which we would supply it with our next generation tape library that was under development arcvault 
shipments of the tape libraries had not yet commenced but were expected to begin shortly 
in august  after a year of development  we launched our ultamus pro product which incorporated the technology we acquired from zetta 
we had planned to facilitate our entry into the primary protected disk market with ultamus pro  but this product failed to achieve market acceptance 
in october  we discontinued our research and development efforts on the zetta technology  and recorded an impairment charge of million in the first quarter of fiscal related in large part to the decline in hp revenue and the loss of the dell agreement  for the fiscal year ended june   we reported net revenue of million compared with million for the prior fiscal year 
the decline in net revenue and the increases in costs related to manufacturing and research and development resulted in a net loss for fiscal of million  or per share  compared with a net loss of million  or per share  a year earlier 
these results also reflect lower than expected sales in our branded sales channel during fiscal positive trends 
despite the disappointing financial results in fiscal  we have recently achieved a number of financial and operational objectives which we believe will assist us in our efforts to regain profitability in the fourth quarter of fiscal  our cash balance grew by million to million from million  which is the first time in eight quarters that we have reported positive cash flow 
through a combination of cost reduction efforts and the completion of research and development cycles  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  our operating expenses reached their lowest level in over three and a half years 
additionally  we projected we would reduce inventory levels by million in the fourth quarter of  and exceeded that target by reducing inventory levels by over million 
we continue to work to reduce costs  improve efficiencies and reduce inventory levels 
in june  we launched three new products ultamus raid  reo and reo due to their introduction late in the fourth quarter  these products did not materially contribute to revenue in fiscal however  we expect these new products  together with additional new products we expect to launch in the first half of fiscal  to improve results in our branded sales channel during fiscal we have also been working to update all of our reo products with new hardware platforms that we believe will i boost the speed and performance of these products  and ii be compliant with the european union directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs 
having completed the transfer of manufacturing back to our headquarters in san diego in february  we believe our customer lead times have been reduced to target levels and that we have regained our reputation for timely delivery of quality products 
we also believe we have eliminated the backlog issues that occurred during the outsourced period 
liquidity and capital resources 
historically  our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from operations 
however  in fiscal  we incurred a net loss of million and the balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments declined by million compared to the balance at june  at june   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million at june  we have no other unused sources of liquidity at this time 
although we reported positive cash flow in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we expect to continue to incur losses during fiscal as we introduce and market our new products 
in fiscal  cash management and preservation will be a top priority 
industry trends 
historically  magnetic tape has been used for all forms of data backup and recovery  because magnetic tape was  and still is  the only cost effective  removable  high capacity storage media that can be taken off site to ensure that data is safeguarded in case of disaster 
for a number of years now  we have held a market leading position in mid range tape automation with our flagship neo products  and sales of tape automation appliances have represented more than of our revenue for each of the last three fiscal years 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we commenced development of arcvault  our new tape automation platform 
the first two products in the arcvault family were launched in july with the final product launched in april although we expect that tape solutions will continue to be the anchor of the data protection strategy at most companies  tape backup is time consuming and often unreliable and inefficient 
the process of recovering data from tape is also time consuming and inefficient 
ultimately  we expect that tape will be relegated to an archival role for less frequently accessed data  and that companies will focus more on disk based solutions moving forward 
recent developments in august  our board of directors appointed vernon a 
loforti as our president and chief executive officer  replacing scott mcclendon  who was serving as interim president and chief executive officer 
upon the recommendation of our nominating and governance committee  mr 
loforti was also appointed as a member of our board of directors 
mr 
loforti has served as our vice president and chief financial officer since joining us in december in august  our board of directors appointed kurt l 
kalbfleisch as our interim chief financial officer  replacing mr 
loforti as chief financial officer 
mr 
kalbfleisch has been an employee of our company since december  and most recently has served as our vice president of finance since july  in which position he also continues to serve 
mr 
mcclendon remains as our chairman of our board 
because mr 
mcclendon served as our interim president and chief executive officer for less than one year  our board of directors  after analysis and recommendation of our nominating and governance committee  determined that mr 
mcclendon qualifies as an independent director under nasdaq marketplace rule a critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition  share based compensation  bad debts  inventories  intangible and other long lived assets  warranty obligations  income taxes and restructuring charges 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from sales of products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred 
under this policy  revenue on direct product sales excluding sales to distributors and certain oem customers is recognized upon shipment of products to our customers 
these customers are not entitled to any specific right of return or price protection  except for any defective product that may be returned under our warranty policy 
title and risk of loss transfer to the customer when the product leaves our dock 
product sales to distribution customers are subject to certain rights of return  stock rotation privileges and price protection 
because we are unable to estimate our exposure for returned product or price adjustments  revenue from shipments to these customers is not recognized until the related products are in turn sold to the ultimate customer by the distributor 
as part of our existing agreements with certain oem customers  we ship products to various distribution hubs around the world and retain ownership of that inventory until it is pulled by these oem customers to fulfill their customer orders  at which time revenue is recognized 
for products in which software is essential to functionality  we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition 
when there are multiple elements in an arrangement  we allocate revenue to the separate elements based on relative fair value  provided we have fair value for all elements of the arrangement 
if in an arrangement we have fair value for undelivered elements but not the delivered element  we defer the fair value of the undelivered element s and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered element s 
undelivered elements typically include services 
revenue from extended warranty and product service contracts is initially deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the contract period 
we have various licensing agreements relating to our variable rate randomizer vr technology with third parties 
as consideration for licensing our vr technology  the licensees pay us a royalty fee for sales of their products that incorporate our vr technology 
on a periodic basis  the licensees provide us with reports that include the quantity of units  subject to royalty  sold to their end users 
we record the royalty when reported to us by the licensee  generally in the period during which the licensee ships the products containing vr technology 
in certain instances  the customer has elected to purchase from us the applications specific integrated circuit asic chips embodying vr  which are priced to include the cost of the chip plus an embedded royalty fee  and revenue on asic chip sales is recorded as product revenue when earned  which under our fob origin terms is upon shipment  of the underlying asic chip incorporating the vr technology to the customer 
share based compensation share based compensation expense can be significant to our results of operations  even though no cash is used for such expense 
in determining period expense associated with unvested options  we estimate the fair value of each option at the date of grant 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the award 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected volatility of our stock and the expected term the average employee will hold the option prior to the date of exercise 
in addition  we estimate pre vesting forfeitures for share based awards that are not expected to vest 
we primarily use historical data to determine the inputs and assumptions to be used in the black scholes pricing model 
changes in these inputs and assumptions could occur and could materially affect the measure of estimated fair value and make it difficult to compare the results in future periods to our current results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectibility of specific accounts and the overall condition of the accounts receivable portfolio 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze specific trade and other receivables  historical bad debts  customer credits  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customers payment terms and or patterns 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make additional payments  then we may need to make additional allowances 
likewise  if we determine that we could realize more of our receivables in the future than previously estimated  we would adjust the allowance to increase income in the period we made this determination 
we review the allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis and record adjustments as considered necessary 
inventory valuation we record inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we assess the value of our inventories periodically based upon numerous factors including expected product or material demand  current market conditions  technological obsolescence  current cost and net realizable value 
if necessary  we adjust our inventory for obsolete or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than what we projected  we may need to record additional inventory adjustments and adverse purchase commitments 
business acquisitions and intangible assets our business acquisitions typically result in recognition of intangible assets acquired technology  which affect the amount of current and future period charges and amortization expenses  and in certain cases non recurring charges associated with in process research and development ipr d 
we amortize our definite lived intangible assets using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  while ipr d is recorded as a non recurring charge on the acquisition date 
the determination of the value of these components of a business combination  as well as associated asset useful lives  requires management to make various estimates and assumptions 
critical estimates in valuing intangible assets may include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales and services  maintenance agreements  and acquired development technologies and patents or trademarks  expected costs to develop the ipr d into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired products and services will continue to be used in our product portfolio  and discount rates 
management s estimates of fair value and useful lives are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur and assumptions may change 
estimates using different assumptions could also produce significantly different results 
impairment of long lived assets we test for recoverability of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
when the carrying value is not considered recoverable  an impairment loss  for the amount by which the carrying value of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value  is recognized with an offsetting reduction in the carrying value of the related asset s 
in such circumstances  we may incur material charges relating to the impairment of such asset 
fair value is generally determined based on the estimated future discounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the asset or asset group using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded an million impairment charge related to acquired technology 
see impairment of acquired technology under the discussion of results of operations below 
if the company s future results are significantly different than forecasted  the company may be required to further evaluate its long lived assets for recoverability and such analysis could result in an impairment charge in a future period 
the assumptions supporting the cash flows  including the discount rates  are determined using management s best estimates as of the date of the impairment review 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets and future results of operations could be adversely affected 
warranty obligations the company provides for estimated future costs of warranty obligations in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  and discloses those obligations as required by fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
for return to factory and on site warranties  we accrue for warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized based on contractual rights and on the historical rate of claims and costs to provide warranty services 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims above historical experience or our costs to provide warranty services increase  we may be required to increase our warranty accrual 
the impact of theses unforeseen increases may have an adverse impact on our gross margins in subsequent periods 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes 
under this approach  deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid 
the provision for income taxes generally represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year 
deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when a judgment is made that it is considered more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
a decision to record a valuation allowance results in an increase in income tax expense or a de crease in income tax benefit as we had in fiscal 
if the valuation allowance  recorded in fiscal  is released in a future period  income tax expense will be reduced accordingly 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
restructuring charges in recent periods and over the past several years  we recorded restructuring charges related to the realignment and restructuring of our business operations 
these charges represent expenses incurred in connection with certain cost reduction programs and acquisition integrations that we have implemented and consist of the cost of involuntary termination benefits  separation benefits and facilities charges 
the charges for severance and exit costs require the use of estimates  primarily related to the amount of severance and related benefits to be paid and the cost of exiting facilities 
we account for restructuring charges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
establishes fair value as the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
restructuring charges we have incurred under sfas no 
in recent years include severance and facilities charges

fiscal compared to fiscal net revenue 
net revenue decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal  a decrease of approximately million  or 
the decline was primarily the result of lower sales to hp  but decreases in net revenue in our branded sales channel were also consistent throughout all of the regions americas  emea and apac  partially offset by an increase in service revenue 
product sales net product revenue decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal  a decrease of million  or net product revenue from oem customers decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the decrease of million  or  is primarily associated with declining sales to hp 
net revenue from hp represented approximately of total net revenue during fiscal compared to of total net revenue during fiscal net product revenue from overland branded products  excluding service revenue  decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the decrease of approximately million  or  was primarily associated with i a million decrease in revenue due to the discontinuation of our powerloader and loaderxpress products  ii a million decrease in our neo product sales and iii a million decrease in our reo product sales  primarily due to a limited supply of rohs compliant product which affected sales in europe 
these decreases were partially offset by million of net product revenue generated from sales of our new arcvault product which we introduced in early fiscal service net service revenue increased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the increase of million or is associated with i a million increase associated with an increase in the number of service contracts sold due to increased focus in this area and ii a million increase in of out of warranty services provided  primarily to hp 
royalty fees net royalty fees decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the decrease of approximately  or is primarily associated with lower vr royalties occurring in fiscal  partially offset by other royalty fees 
vr royalties during fiscal totaled approximately million compared to million during fiscal gross profit 
overall gross profit decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal  a decrease of approximately million  or 
product sales product gross profit decreased to million  or  for fiscal compared to million  or  for fiscal the increase in product gross profit is associated primarily with i significant under absorption of manufacturing costs arising from the transition of manufacturing back to san diego and ii a million increase in reserves taken for obsolete inventory 
these increases were slightly offset by a million decrease in amortization expense because of the impairment of the zetta acquired technology 
in addition  product gross profit was affected by decreased sales across all channels  especially oem 
service service gross profit for fiscal of million increased from million for fiscal the increase in service gross profit of million  or  is primarily associated with an increase in service revenue in fiscal from fiscal  as noted above and related increases in outside repair costs 
stock based compensation 
during fiscal  we had a net reversal  or benefit  of  compared to million of share based compensation charges in fiscal the net reversal in fiscal resulted from significant pre vesting forfeitures in excess of amounts previously estimated related to the forfeiture of options and restricted shares previously granted to two executives and individuals terminated as part of the october and april restructurings 
the pre vesting forfeitures resulted in the reversal of previously recognized share based compensation expense and such reversal exceeded the amount of expense recorded for other awards during fiscal share based compensation was allocated as follows in thousands fiscal year change cost of product revenue sales and marketing research and development general and administrative sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense was million during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal the decrease of approximately million  or  is primarily due to i a decrease of approximately million in employee and related expenses including travel and sales commissions associated with a decrease in average headcount by employees associated with our fiscal restructurings and realignment of our sales force  ii a  reduction in share based compensation expense associated with a reversal of awards that canceled prior to vesting and a reduction of related expense under fin no 
associated with our accelerated amortization methodology  iii a  decrease in contractor fees related to cost reduction initiatives and iv a  reduction in public relations expenses related to reduced promotional spending 
these reductions were partially offset by an increase of million in severance associated with our fiscal restructurings and other severance recorded in the first quarter of fiscal research and development expense 
research and development r d expense was million during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal the decrease of approximately million  or  is primarily due to i a million decrease in employee and related expenses associated with a decrease in average headcount by employees primarily associated with the closing of the office near seattle  washington  the april reduction in workforce and completion of scheduled r d projects  ii a net decrease of  in development materials and tooling and demonstration items as a result of fewer continuing r d projects  and iii a decrease of  of share based compensation expense associated with a reversal of awards that canceled prior to vesting and a reduction of related expense under fin no 
associated with our accelerated amortization methodology 
these cost savings were partially offset by a  increase in severance primarily associated with our fiscal restructurings 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal the decrease of approximately million  or  is primarily due to i a  reduction in share based compensation expense associated with a reversal of awards that canceled prior to vesting and a reduction of related expense under fin no 
associated with our accelerated amortization methodology  and ii a  net reduction in legal fees 
our legal fees in fiscal were higher as a result of the accumulation of our shares by a competitor and related issues 
these expense reductions were offset by i increased severance expenses of approximately  primarily related to the termination of our former president and chief executive officer  and ii a  increase in bad debt expense 
impairment of acquired technology 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the technology acquired from zetta systems  inc zetta in august as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  management performed an impairment analysis of the technology acquired from zetta  in accordance with sfas no 
 and concluded that the asset was not recoverable and that an impairment loss should be recognized as of september  the full amount of the remaining intangible asset balance as of september   or million  was recorded as an impairment of acquired technology in the first quarter of fiscal in process research and development 
during fiscal  a portion of the fair value of the assets acquired from zetta was assigned to in process research and development 
we had no similar transactions in fiscal interest income  net 
during fiscal  we generated net interest income of million compared to million during the same period of the prior fiscal year 
the decrease of approximately million or is due to lower cash and investment balances when compared to the same period in fiscal other income expense  net 
during fiscal  we incurred net other expense of  compared to  during fiscal the increase in other net expense is primarily associated with i an increase of  in realized losses on foreign currency transactions due to a weakening of the dollar compared to the euro and the british pound  and ii an increase in realized losses on our short term investments to  in fiscal from  in fiscal fiscal includes a  impairment charge under fsp fas and  with no comparable charge in fiscal provision for benefit from income taxes 
we recorded income tax expense of  during fiscal compared to an income tax benefit of million during fiscal the change of approximately million is primarily due to tax benefit recorded in fiscal for losses that were carried back to prior years tax returns for refund claims 
fiscal tax expense is primarily due to tax expense related to earnings in our foreign operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal net revenue 
net revenue decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal  a decrease of approximately million  or 
the decline was primarily the result of lower sales to hp  offset by i a increase in sales of branded products and ii an increase in service revenue 
we finished the year with a million backlog due to production and inventory problems at our outsourced manufacturer which delayed shipping of products  principally to hp and to one of our asia pacific apac oem customers 
product sales net product revenue decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal  a decrease of million  or net product revenue from oem customers decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the decrease of million  or  was primarily due to the expected decline in shipments of our neo products to hp and ibm as these customers begin to transition to alternate products sourced from other suppliers 
net revenue from hp represented approximately of net revenue in fiscal compared to of net revenue for fiscal net product revenue from overland branded products  excluding service revenue  decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the decrease of approximately million  or  was primarily associated with a increase in sales of branded products in our apac region offset by a decline in sales within our emea europe  middle east and africa region 
service net service revenue increased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the increase of million or is associated with a million increase in out of warranty services provided  primarily to hp  partially offset by approximately a  decrease in the number of service contracts sold 
royalty fees net royalty fees decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the decrease of approximately  or is associated with lower vr royalties 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased from million during fiscal to million during fiscal  a decrease of approximately million or 
product sales product gross profit decreased to million  or  during of fiscal compared to million  or  during fiscal and was negatively affected by i redundant costs to support sanmina and ii amortization expense of million related to the technology acquired from zetta 
in addition  gross profit was negatively affected by increased materials and labor costs  partially offset by a decrease in other cost of product revenue 
service service gross profit increased to million  or  for fiscal from million  or  for fiscal the increase in gross profit of million  or  showed significant improvement in material gross margins offset by a slight decrease in other cost of service revenue 
share based compensation 
during fiscal  we recorded million of share based compensation charges associated with the adoption of sfas no 
r  of which  was allocated to cost of revenue   was allocated to sales and marketing   to research and development and million to general and administrative expenses 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the increase of approximately million or was primarily associated with increased compensation expense of approximately million associated with an increase in headcount of employees and  in share based compensation expense not included in fiscal  partially offset by reduced promotional spending of approximately research and development expense 
research and development expenses increased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the increase of approximately million or was primarily due to a million increase in compensation costs associated with i an increase in headcount resulting from the acquisition of the zetta development team and ii million in costs related to development of arcvault 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses increased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the increase of approximately million or was primarily due to i million share based compensation costs not included in the prior year period  ii  in higher than expected legal fees due to the accumulation of our shares in early fiscal by a competitor  iii  severance costs  and iv  in increased it spending  partially offset by a reduction in readiness costs associated with section of the sarbanes oxley act of in process research and development 
the purchase price of our acquisition of zetta was assigned to the fair value of the assets acquired  including in process research and development 
as of the acquisition date  technological feasibility of the in process technology had not been established 
therefore  the in process research and development of million was recorded as expense at the date of the acquisition 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to in process research and development was based on established valuation techniques used in the technology industry 
the fair value assigned to the acquired in process research and development was determined using the income approach  which discounts projected future cash flows to present value 
the key assumptions used in the valuation included  among others  expected completion date of the in process projects identified as of the acquisition date  estimated costs to complete the projects  revenue contributions and expense projections assuming the resulting product has entered the market  and discount rate based on the risks associated with the development life cycle of the acquired in process technology 
interest income 
interest income increased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the increase of approximately million or is due to higher average yields when compared to fiscal benefit from provision for income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million for fiscal compared to income tax expense of  for fiscal the change of approximately million is primarily due to our loss in fiscal versus income in fiscal  partially offset by the impact of recording a full valuation allowance  against our net deferred tax assets  for fiscal the benefit of million recorded in fiscal represents the current benefit earned for losses that can be carried back to prior years tax returns for refund claims 
liquidity and capital resources at june   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million at june  we have no other unused sources of liquidity at this time 
historically  our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from operations 
however  we have incurred losses in recent periods and negative cash flows during the current fiscal year 
as of or for the year ended june   we had an accumulated deficit of million  incurred a net loss of million and the balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments declined by million compared to the balance at june  we operate in a highly competitive market characterized by rapidly changing technology 
during fiscal  we expect to continue to incur losses as we introduce and market our new products 
however  we expect to increase inventory turns and further reduce our inventory levels 
management expects that this reduction in inventory levels  our current balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and anticipated funds from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the twelve months following the balance sheet date 
we need to generate additional revenue  improve our gross profit margins and reduce operating expenses to be profitable in future periods 
our recent history of net losses could cause current or potential customers to defer new orders with us or select other vendors  and may cause suppliers to require terms that are unfavorable to us 
failure to achieve profitability  or maintain profitability if achieved  may require us to raise additional funding which i could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock  ii we may not be able to obtain in the necessary time frame to avoid disruptions to our business or on terms favorable to us  if at all  or iii may be inadequate to enable us to continue to conduct business 
if needed  failure to raise such additional funding may adversely affect our ability to achieve our longer term business objectives 
during fiscal  we used cash in operating activities of approximately million compared to cash provided from operating activities in fiscal and of million and million  respectively 
the change from fiscal to of million is primarily attributed to our increased net loss  offset by a non cash impairment of acquired technology of million 
from fiscal to  there was a change of million in cash provided by operating activities 
this change was primarily the result of our net loss in fiscal compared to net income in fiscal during fiscal and  we generated cash from investing activities of million and million  respectively  compared to cash used in investing activities of million during fiscal during fiscal and we liquidated some of our investments to support our operations 
in fiscal  we used million to acquire zetta with no other similar acquisitions in fiscal or during fiscal  and  capital expenditures totaled million  million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  such expenditures were primarily associated with computers  machinery and equipment to support new product development and transitioning manufacturing in house 
during fiscal and  capital expenditures were comprised primarily of software and tooling equipment 
we used cash in our financing activities of million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal and cash provided by financing activities in fiscal of million 
during fiscal  and we used cash of million  million and  respectively to repurchase  shares  million shares and  shares of our stock under our repurchase program
