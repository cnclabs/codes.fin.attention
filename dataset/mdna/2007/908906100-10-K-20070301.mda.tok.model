banking lines of business our operations are divided into two primary segments  which are described more fully in business segments of our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a and in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report

our insurance services group offers our customers a variety of cost effective risk management services and insurance products 
employees at january   we had  full time equivalent employees 
competition banking is a highly competitive business 
we compete actively for loan  deposit  and other financial services business in california  oregon and washington  as well as nationally and internationally 
our competitors include a large number of state and national banks  thrift institutions  credit unions  finance companies  mortgage banks and major foreign affiliated or foreign banks  as well as many financial and nonfinancial firms that offer services similar to those offered by us  including many large securities firms 
some of our competitors are community or regional banks that have strong local market positions 
other competitors include large financial institutions that have substantial capital  technology and marketing resources  which are well in excess of ours 
such large financial institutions may have greater access to capital at a lower cost than us  which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 
we also experience competition  especially for deposits  from internet based banking institutions  which have grown rapidly in recent years 
technology and other changes increasingly allow parties to complete financial transactions electronically  and in many cases  without banks 
for example  consumers can pay bills and transfer funds over the internet and by telephone without banks 
many non bank financial service providers have lower overhead costs and are subject to fewer regulatory constraints 
if consumers do not use banks to complete their financial transactions  we could potentially lose fee income  deposits and income generated from those deposits 
changes in federal law have made it easier for out of state banks to enter and compete in the states in which we operate 
the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the riegle neal act  among other things  eliminated substantially all state law barriers to the acquisition of banks by out of state bank holding companies 
a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state  without regard to the permissibility of such acquisitions under state law  but subject to any state requirement that the acquired bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years  and the requirement that the acquiring bank holding company  prior to or following the proposed acquisition  controls no more than percent of the total amount of deposits of the insured depository institutions in the united states and no more than percent of such deposits in that state or such lesser or greater amount as may be established by state law 
the riegle neal act also permits banks to acquire branches located in another state by purchasing or merging with a bank chartered in that state or a national banking association having its headquarters located in that state 
banks  securities firms  and insurance companies can now combine as a financial holding company 
financial holding companies can offer virtually any type of financial service  including banking  securities underwriting  insurance both agency and underwriting  and merchant banking 
many of our competitors have elected to become financial holding companies 
a number of foreign banks have either acquired financial holding companies or obtained financial holding company status in the us  further increasing competition in the us market 
we are not a financial holding company 
a bank holding company may elect to become a financial holding company if all of its subsidiary depository institutions are well capitalized and well managed 
under current federal reserve board interpretations  a foreign bank holding company  which controls a subsidiary us bank holding company  such as mitsubishi ufj financial group  must make the election 
in addition  the foreign bank holding company if it is a bank itself must be well capitalized and well managed in accordance with standards comparable to those required of us banks as determined by the federal reserve board and its us bank subsidiary must have a satisfactory or better cra rating 
mitsubishi ufj financial group is not presently a financial holding company 
we believe that continued emphasis on enhanced services and distribution systems  an expanded customer base  increased productivity and strong credit quality  together with a substantial capital base  will position us to meet the challenges provided by this competition 
monetary policy and economic conditions our earnings and businesses are affected not only by general economic conditions both domestic and international  but also by the monetary policies of various governmental regulatory authorities of the united states and foreign governments and international agencies 
in particular  our earnings and growth may be affected by actions of the federal reserve board in connection with its implementation of national monetary policy through its open market operations in united states government securities  control of the discount rate for borrowings by financial institutions and establishment of reserve requirements against both member and non member financial institutions deposits 
these actions have a significant effect on the overall growth and distribution of loans and leases  investments and deposits  as well as on the rates earned on securities  loans and leases or paid on deposits 
it is difficult to predict future changes in monetary policies and their effect on our business 
supervision and regulation overview 
bank holding companies and banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state law 
this regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors  the deposit insurance fund  and other clients of the institution  and not for the benefit of the investors in the stock or other securities of the bank holding company 
set forth below is a summary description of the material laws and regulations that relate to our operation and those of our subsidiaries  including union bank of california 
bank holding company act 
we  mitsubishi ufj financial group and the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj are subject to regulation under the bank holding company act of  as amended  bhca which subjects us to federal reserve board reporting and examination requirements 
generally  the bhca restricts our ability to invest in non banking entities  and we may not acquire more than percent of the voting shares of any domestic bank without the prior approval of the federal reserve board 
our activities are limited  with some exceptions  to banking  the business of managing or controlling banks  and other activities  which the federal reserve board deems to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto 
under federal reserve board regulations  a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner 
under this policy  the federal reserve board may require a holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank 
comptroller of the currency 
union bank of california  as a national banking association  is subject to broad federal regulation and oversight extending to all its operations by the office of the comptroller of the currency  its primary regulator  and also by the federal reserve board and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
as part of this authority  union bank of california is required to file periodic reports with the comptroller of the currency and is subject to on going examination by the comptroller of the currency 
the comptroller of the currency has extensive enforcement authority over all national banks 
if  as a result of an examination of a bank  the comptroller of the currency determines that the financial condition  capital resources  asset quality  earnings prospects  management  liquidity  or other aspects of the bank s operations are unsatisfactory or that the bank or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulations  various remedies are available to the comptroller of the currency 
these remedies include the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound practices  to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice  to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced to direct an increase in capital  to restrict the growth of the bank  to assess civil monetary penalties  to remove officers and directors  and ultimately to terminate the bank s deposit insurance 
the comptroller of the currency  as well as other federal agencies  have adopted regulations and guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards  including but not limited to such matters as loan underwriting and documentation  internal controls and audit systems  interest rate risk exposure  asset quality and earnings and compensation and other employee benefits 
other regulatory oversight 
our subsidiaries are also subject to extensive regulation  supervision  and examination by various other federal and state regulatory agencies 
in addition  union bank of california and its subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions under the federal reserve act and related regulations  including restrictions on affiliate transactions 
as a holding company  the principal source of our cash has been dividends and interest received from union bank of california 
dividends payable by union bank of california to us are subject to restrictions under a formula imposed by the office of the comptroller of the currency unless express approval is given to exceed these limitations 
for more information regarding restrictions on loans and dividends by union bank of california to its affiliates and on transactions with affiliates  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia requires federal bank regulatory authorities to take prompt corrective action in dealing with inadequately capitalized banks 
fdicia established five tiers of capital measurement ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized 
it is our policy to maintain capital ratios above the minimum regulatory requirements for well capitalized institutions for both union bank of california and us 
management believes that  at december   union bank of california and we met the requirements for well capitalized institutions 
deposits of union bank of california are insured up to statutory limits by the federal deposit insurance corporation and  accordingly  are subject to deposit insurance assessments 
in february  president bush signed the federal deposit insurance reform act of and the federal deposit insurance reform conforming amendments act of into law 
pursuant to these acts  the bank insurance fund and the savings association insurance fund were merged into a new fund  the deposit insurance fund  effective march  these acts  as implemented by the fdic  also created a new assessment system designed to more closely tie what banks pay for deposit insurance to the risks they pose and adopted a new base schedule of rates that the fdic can adjust up or down  depending on the revenue needs of the insurance fund 
as a result of this legislation  commencing on january   we expect that union bank of california will be subject to increased annual assessments on deposits in the range of to basis points 
prior to this change  union bank of california was not paying any insurance assessments on deposits under the fdic s risk related assessment system 
an fdic credit for prior contributions is expected to offset the assessment in there are additional requirements and restrictions in the laws of the united states and the states of california  oregon  and washington  as well as other states in which union bank of california and its subsidiaries may conduct operations 
these include restrictions on the levels of lending and the nature and amount of investments  as well as activities as an underwriter of securities  the opening and closing of branches and the acquisition of other financial institutions 
the consumer lending and finance activities of union bank of california are also subject to extensive regulation under various federal and state laws 
these statutes impose requirements on the making  enforcement and collection of consumer loans and on the types of disclosures that must be made in connection with such loans 
union bank of california is also subject to the community reinvestment act cra 
the cra generally requires the federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the needs of local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
in addition to substantial penalties and corrective measures that may be required for a violation of certain fair lending laws  the federal banking agencies may take compliance with such laws and cra into account when regulating and supervising other activities  and in evaluating whether to approve applications for permission to engage in new activities or for acquisitions of other banks or companies 
an unsatisfactory rating may be the basis for denying the application 
based on the most current examination report dated october   union bank of california was rated outstanding 
union bank of california has branches in canada and the cayman islands 
any international activities of union bank of california are also subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction where business is being conducted  which may change from time to time and affect union bank of california s business opportunities and competitiveness in these jurisdictions 
furthermore  due to the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj s controlling ownership of us  regulatory requirements adopted or enforced by the government of japan may have an effect on the activities and investments of union bank of california and us in the future 
the activities of union bank of california subsidiaries  highmark capital management  inc and unionbanc investment services llc are subject to the rules and regulations of the sec  as well as those of state securities regulators 
unionbanc investment services llc is also subject to the rules and regulations of the national association of securities dealers nasd 
unionbanc insurance services  inc is an indirect subsidiary of union bank of california and is subject to the rules and regulations of the california department of insurance  as well as insurance regulators of other states 
glb act 
the gramm leach bliley glb act allows financial holding companies to offer banking  insurance  securities and other financial products 
among other things  the glb act amended section of the bhca in order to provide a framework for engaging in new financial activities by bank holding companies 
a bank holding company may elect to become a financial holding company if all of its subsidiary depository institutions are well capitalized and well managed 
under current federal reserve board interpretations  a foreign bank holding company  which controls a subsidiary us bank holding company  such as mitsubishi ufj financial group  must make the election 
in addition  the foreign bank holding company if it is a bank itself must be well capitalized and well managed in accordance with standards comparable to those required of us banks as determined by the federal reserve board and its us bank subsidiary must have a satisfactory or better cra rating 
mitsubishi ufj financial group is not presently a financial holding company 
under the glb act  financial subsidiaries of banks may engage in some types of activities beyond those permitted to banks themselves  provided certain conditions are met 
union bank of california has no plans to seek to form any financial subsidiaries in the near future 
broker dealer regulation 
other provisions of the glb act amended the securities exchange act of to eliminate the blanket exemption for banks from the definition of broker under that act and replaced this exemption with enumerated permissible bank brokerage activities 
after implementation of these glb act provisions  banks are required to register as a broker to engage in securities brokerage operations beyond the limited bank brokerage activities permitted by the glb act 
in december  the sec and the federal reserve board jointly issued proposed regulation r which would implement the securities brokerage limitations of the glb act 
proposed regulation r also defines certain terms used in the glb act and contains additional regulatory exemptions for limited bank brokerage activities 
the sec has delayed implementation of the glb act brokerage provisions until the third quarter of if adopted as proposed  regulation r would further delay implementation of these provisions for union bank of california until january assuming union bank of california does not register as a broker  we anticipate the glb act and regulation r will require us to conduct non exempted securities brokerage activities through our registered broker dealer  unionbanc investment services  llc or another registered broker dealer subsidiary 
these laws and regulations will also limit compensation we may pay our bank employees for referrals of brokerage business and limit union bank of california s ability to advertise securities brokerage services 
bank secrecy act 
the banking industry is now subject to significantly increased regulatory controls and processes regarding the bank secrecy act and anti money laundering laws 
this may adversely affect the ability to obtain regulatory approvals for future initiatives requiring regulatory approval  including acquisitions 
under the usa patriot act  federal banking regulators must consider the effectiveness of a financial institution s anti money laundering program prior to approving an application for a merger  acquisition or other activities requiring regulatory approval 
for information regarding certain regulatory matters that may adversely affect our ability to expand through acquisitions  see regulatory matters in md a of this annual report 
sarbanes oxley act 
on july   in response to various high profile corporate scandals  the united states congress enacted the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act aims to restore the credibility lost as a result of these scandals by addressing  among other issues  corporate governance  auditing and accounting  executive compensation  and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information 
the new york stock exchange has adopted  and the sec has approved  additional corporate governance rules 
the new rules are intended to allow stockholders to more easily and effectively monitor the performance of companies and directors 
among other provisions  section a of the sarbanes oxley act requires that our chief executive officer and chief financial officer certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement or omission of a material fact 
specific requirements of the certifications include having these officers confirm that they are responsible for establishing  maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures  they have made certain disclosures to our independent public accounting firm and audit committee about our internal controls  and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to their evaluation 
in addition  section of the sarbanes oxley act and the sec s rules and regulations thereunder require our management to evaluate  with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officers  the effectiveness  as of the end of each fiscal year  of our internal control over financial reporting 
our management must then provide a report on our internal control over financial reporting that contains  among other things  a statement of their responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting  and a statement identifying the framework we used to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
in response to these requirements  we have established a disclosure committee to monitor compliance with these rules 
membership of the disclosure committee is comprised of senior management from throughout our organization whom we believe collectively provide an extensive understanding of our operations 
as part of our compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  we evaluate our internal control process quarterly and we test and assess our internal controls over financial reporting annually  in compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
basel committee capital standards 
the basel committee on banking supervision bis proposed new international capital standards for banking organizations basel ii in june  and the proposal is currently being evaluated by bank supervisory authorities worldwide 
basel ii is an effort to update the original international bank capital accord basel i  which has been in effect since basel ii is intended to improve the consistency of capital regulations internationally  make regulatory capital more risk sensitive  and promote enhanced risk management practices among large  internationally active banking organizations 
the ultimate timing for implementation of basel ii and the specifics of capital assessments for addressing operational risk are still uncertain 
in september  the us banking and thrift agencies published an interagency notice of proposed rulemaking for rules that would implement new risk based capital requirements under basel ii in the us for those us bank holding companies  that meet the minimum threshold for reporting  although others may opt in 
the new rules apply to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of billion or more and consolidated on balance sheet foreign exposures of billion or more 
though we do not meet this criteria  mitsubishi ufj financial group  our indirect majority owner  will be subject to the requirements of basel ii 
in addition  in december  the us banking and thrift agencies published an interagency notice of proposed rulemaking for a basel ia initiative which would revise the existing us risk based capital framework for banks not subject to basel ii 
under the proposed basel a rule  compliance with the new risk based capital framework would be optional 
the comment period for both rule proposals will end in march and the banking agencies have indicated that final rules could be published in the third quarter of we are evaluating what effect these proposed rules and the new capital requirements that may arise out of a new bis capital accord may have on our minimum capital requirements 
customer information security 
the federal reserve board and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted final guidelines for safeguarding confidential  personal customer information 
the guidelines required each financial institution  under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof  to create  implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information  protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer 
union bank of california has adopted a customer information security program that has been approved by its board of directors 
privacy 
the glb act requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers to non affiliate third parties 
in general  the statute requires explanations to consumers on policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information  and  except as otherwise required by law  prohibits disclosing such information except as provided in the banks policies and procedures 
union bank of california implemented a privacy policy effective since the glb act became law  pursuant to which all of its existing and new customers are notified of the privacy policies 
state laws and regulations designed to protect the privacy and security of customer information apply also to us and our other subsidiaries 
we and union bank of california cannot be certain of the effect  if any  of the foregoing legislative and regulatory developments on our businesses 
future legislation future changes in the laws  regulations  or policies that impact union bank of california  our other subsidiaries and us cannot be predicted and may have a material effect on our business and earnings 
legislation relating to banking and other financial services has been introduced from time to time in congress and is likely to be introduced in the future 
if enacted  such legislation could significantly change the competitive environment in which we and our subsidiaries operate 
we cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted or the ultimate impact of any such legislation on our competitive situation  financial condition or results of operations 
financial information see our consolidated financial statements starting on page f for financial information about unionbancal corporation and its subsidiaries 
item a 
risk factors industry factors fluctuations in interest rates on loans could adversely affect our business significant increases in market interest rates on loans  or the perception that an increase may occur  could adversely affect both our ability to originate new loans and our ability to grow 
conversely  decreases in interest rates could result in an acceleration of loan prepayments 
an increase in market interest rates could also adversely affect the ability of our floating rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations 
if this occurred  it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and charge offs  which could adversely affect our business 
fluctuations in interest rates on deposits or other funding sources could adversely affect our margin spread changes in market interest rates on deposits or other funding sources  including changes in the relationship between short term and long term market interest rates or between different interest rate indices  can impact our margin spread  that is  the difference between the interest rates we charge on interest earning assets  such as loans  and the interest rates we pay on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits or other borrowings 
the impact could result in a decrease in our interest income relative to interest expense 
our deposit customers may pursue alternatives to bank deposits or seek higher yielding deposits  causing us to incur increased funding costs the banking industry and we are facing increasing deposit pricing pressures 
checking and savings account balances and other forms of deposits can decrease when our deposit customers perceive alternative investments  such as the stock market  other non depository investments or higher yielding deposits  as providing superior expected returns 
technology and other changes have made it more convenient for bank customers to transfer funds into alternative investments or other deposit accounts  including products offered by other financial institutions or non bank service providers 
additional increases in short term interest rates could increase such transfers of deposits to higher yielding deposits or other investments either with us or with external providers 
efforts and initiatives we undertake to retain and increase deposits  including deposit pricing  can increase our costs 
when bank customers move money out of bank deposits in favor of alternative investments or into higher yielding deposits  we can lose a relatively inexpensive source of funds  increasing our funding cost 
changes in the premiums payable to the federal deposit insurance corporation will increase our costs and could adversely affect our business deposits of union bank of california  na are insured up to statutory limits by the federal deposit insurance corporation  or fdic  and  accordingly  are subjected to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the deposit insurance fund 
in november  the fdic issued a final rule  effective january   that created a new assessment system designed to more closely tie what banks pay for deposit insurance to the risks they pose and adopted a new base schedule of rates that the fdic can adjust up or down  depending on the revenue needs of the insurance fund 
this new assessment system is expected to result in increased annual assessments on deposits of union bank of california of to basis points 
prior to this change  union bank of california was not paying any insurance assessments on deposits under the fdic s risk related assessment system 
an fdic credit for prior contributions is expected to offset the assessment for significant increases in the insurance assessments union bank of california pays will increase our costs once the credit is exceeded 
the continuing war on terrorism and overseas military conflicts could adversely affect us and global economic conditions acts or threats of terrorism and actions taken by the us or other governments as a result of such acts or threats and other international hostilities may result in a disruption of us and global economic and financial conditions and could adversely affect business and economic and financial conditions in the us and globally and in our principal markets 
substantial competition could adversely affect us banking is a highly competitive business 
we compete actively for loan  deposit  and other financial services business in california  oregon and washington  as well as nationally and internationally 
our competitors include a large number of state and national banks  thrift institutions  credit unions and major foreign affiliated or foreign banks  as well as many financial and nonfinancial firms that offer services similar to those offered by us  including many large securities firms 
some of our competitors are community or regional banks that have strong local market positions 
other competitors include large financial institutions that have substantial capital  technology and marketing resources that are well in excess of ours 
such large financial institutions may have greater access to capital at a lower cost than us  which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 
we also experience competition  especially for deposits  from internet based banking institutions  which have grown rapidly in recent years 
the effects of  changes in or supervisory enforcement of  banking or other laws and regulations or governmental fiscal or monetary policies could adversely affect us we are subject to significant federal and state regulation and supervision  which is primarily for the benefit and protection of our customers and not for the benefit of investors 
in the past  our business has been materially affected by these regulations 
this will likely continue in the future 
laws  regulations or policies  including accounting standards and interpretations  currently affecting us and our subsidiaries may change at any time 
regulatory authorities may also change their interpretation of these statutes and regulations 
therefore  our business may be adversely affected by changes in laws  regulations  policies or interpretations or regulatory approaches to compliance and enforcement  as well as by fines and other supervisory action taken as a result of noncompliance 
international laws  regulations and policies affecting us  our subsidiaries and the business we conduct may change at any time and affect our business opportunities and competitiveness in these jurisdictions 
due to the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj controlling ownership of us  laws  regulations  policies  fines and other supervisory actions adopted or enforced by the government of japan and the federal reserve board may adversely affect our activities and investments and those of our subsidiaries in the future 
we maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations 
however  some legal regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties which can be substantial for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there were in place at the time systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance 
there may be other negative consequences from a finding of noncompliance  including restrictions on certain activities and damage to our reputation 
additionally  our business is affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the us federal government and its agencies 
we are particularly affected by the policies of the federal reserve board  which regulates the supply of money and credit in the us under long standing policy of the federal reserve board  a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary banks 
as a result of that policy  we may be required to commit financial and other resources to our subsidiary bank in circumstances where we might not otherwise do so 
among the instruments of monetary policy available to the federal reserve board are a conducting open market operations in us government securities  b changing the discount rates on borrowings by depository institutions  and c imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates 
these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits  as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the policies of the federal reserve board may have a material effect on our business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
refer to supervision and regulation above and regulatory matters in our management s discussion and analysis md a in this annual report for discussion of other laws and regulations  including the bank secrecy act and other anti money laundering laws and regulations  that may have a material effect on our business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
changes in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements from time to time the financial accounting standards board and the sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements 
these changes can be very difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively  resulting in our restating prior period financial statements 
there are an increasing number of non bank competitors providing financial services technology and other changes increasingly allow parties to complete financial transactions electronically  and in many cases  without banks 
for example  consumers can pay bills and transfer funds over the internet and by telephone without banks 
many non bank financial service providers have lower overhead costs and are subject to fewer regulatory constraints 
if consumers do not use banks to complete their financial transactions  we could potentially lose fee income  deposits and income generated from those deposits 
company factors adverse california economic conditions could adversely affect our business a substantial majority of our assets  deposits and fee income are generated in california  and a substantial majority of our residential real estate loans are in california 
as a result  poor economic conditions in california may cause us to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in our loan portfolio 
economic conditions in california are subject to various uncertainties at this time  including the softening in the california real estate market and housing industry 
if economic conditions in california decline  we expect that our level of problem assets could increase and our prospects for growth could be impaired 
adverse economic factors affecting certain industries we serve could adversely affect our business we are subject to certain industry specific economic factors 
for example  a significant and increasing portion of our total loan portfolio is related to residential real estate  especially in california 
accordingly  a downturn in the real estate and housing industries in california could have an adverse effect on our operations and the quality of our real estate loan portfolio 
increases in residential mortgage loan interest rates could also have an adverse effect on our operations by depressing new mortgage loan originations 
we provide financing to businesses in a number of other industries that may be particularly vulnerable to industry specific economic factors  including the commercial real estate industry  the communications media industry  the retail industry  the energy industry and the technology industry 
increases in fuel prices and energy costs could adversely affect businesses in several of these industries 
industry specific risks are beyond our control and could adversely affect our portfolio of loans  potentially resulting in an increase in nonperforming loans or charge offs and a slowing of growth or reduction in our loan portfolio 
higher credit losses could require us to increase our allowance for credit losses through a charge to earnings when we loan money or commit to loan money we incur credit risk  or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans 
we reserve for credit losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings 
the amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio and our unfunded credit commitments 
the process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition 
it requires difficult  subjective and complex judgments about the future impact from current economic conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans 
we might underestimate the credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio and have credit losses in excess of the amount reserved 
or  we might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions  which we conclude have caused losses to be sustained in our portfolio 
for example  in a rising interest rate environment  borrowers with adjustable rate loans could see their payments increase 
in the absence of offsetting factors such as increased economic activity and higher wages  this could reduce borrowers ability to repay their loans  resulting in our increasing the allowance 
increased fuel and energy costs could also adversely impact some borrowers ability to repay their loans 
we might also increase the allowance because of unexpected events 
any increase in the allowance would result in a charge to earnings 
we are not able to offer all of the financial services and products of a financial holding company banks  securities firms  and insurance companies can now combine as a financial holding company 
financial holding companies can offer virtually any type of financial service  including banking  securities underwriting  insurance both agency and underwriting  and merchant banking 
many of our competitors have elected to become financial holding companies 
recently  a number of foreign banks have acquired financial holding companies in the us  further increasing competition in the us market 
under current regulatory interpretations  mitsubishi ufj financial group  inc would be required to make a financial holding company election in order for us to have the benefits of this status 
mitsubishi ufj financial group is not presently a financial holding company 
our stockholder votes are controlled by the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj  our interests and those of our minority stockholders may not be the same as those of the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj  a wholly owned subsidiary of mitsubishi ufj financial group  owns a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
as a result  the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj can elect all of our directors and can control the vote on all matters  including approval of mergers or other business combinations  a sale of all or substantially all of our assets  issuance of any additional common stock or other equity securities  incurrence of debt other than in the ordinary course of business  the selection and tenure of our chief executive officer  payment of dividends with respect to our common stock or other equity securities  and other matters that might be favorable to the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj or mitsubishi ufj financial group 
the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj s ability to prevent an unsolicited bid for us or any other change in control could also have an adverse effect on the market price for our common stock 
a majority of our directors are independent of the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj and are not officers or employees of unionbancal corporation or any of our affiliates  including the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj 
however  because of the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj s control over the election of our directors  we could designate ourselves as a controlled company under the new york stock exchange rules and could change the composition of our board of directors so that the board would not have a majority of independent directors 
we have not done so 
possible future sales of our shares by the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj could adversely affect the market for our stock the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj may sell shares of our common stock in compliance with the federal securities laws 
by virtue of the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj s current control of us  the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj could sell large amounts of shares of our common stock by causing us to file a registration statement that would allow it to sell shares more easily 
in addition  the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj could sell shares of our common stock without registration under certain circumstances  such as in a private placement 
although we can make no prediction as to the effect  if any  that such sales would have on the market price of our common stock  sales of substantial amounts of our common stock  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
if the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj sells or transfers shares of our common stock as a block  another person or entity could become our controlling stockholder 
the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj s and mitsubishi ufj financial group s financial or regulatory condition could adversely affect our operations we fund our operations independently of the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj and mitsubishi ufj financial group and believe our business is not necessarily closely related to the business or outlook of the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj or mitsubishi ufj financial group 
however  the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj s and mitsubishi ufj financial group s credit ratings may affect our credit ratings 
the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj and mitsubishi ufj financial group are also subject to regulatory oversight  review and supervisory action which can include fines or penalties by japanese and us regulatory authorities 
our business operations and expansion plans could be negatively affected by regulatory concerns or supervisory action in the us and in japan against the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj or mitsubishi ufj financial group 
for additional information  see md a regulatory matters 
potential conflicts of interest with the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj could adversely affect us the views of the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj and mitsubishi ufj financial group regarding possible new businesses  strategies  acquisitions  divestitures or other initiatives  including compliance and risk management processes  may differ from ours 
this may delay or hinder us from pursuing individual initiatives or cause us to incur additional costs and subject us to additional oversight 
also  as part of the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj s normal risk management processes  the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj manages global credit and other types of exposures and concentrations on an aggregate basis  including exposures and concentrations at unionbancal 
therefore  at certain levels or in certain circumstances  our ability to approve certain credits or other banking transactions and categories of customers is subject to the concurrence of the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj 
we may wish to extend credit or furnish other banking services to the same customers as the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj 
our ability to do so may be limited for various reasons  including the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj s aggregate exposure and marketing policies 
certain directors and officers ownership interests in mitsubishi ufj financial group s common stock or service as a director or officer or other employee of both us and the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest  especially since both of us compete in us banking markets 
restrictions on dividends and other distributions could limit amounts payable to us as a holding company  a substantial portion of our cash flow typically comes from dividends our bank and non bank subsidiaries pay to us 
various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends our subsidiaries can pay to us without regulatory approval 
in addition  if any of our subsidiaries were to liquidate  that subsidiary s creditors will be entitled to receive distributions from the assets of that subsidiary to satisfy their claims against it before we  as a holder of an equity interest in the subsidiary  will be entitled to receive any of the assets of the subsidiary 
our ability to make acquisitions is subject to regulatory constraints and risks associated with potential acquisitions or divestitures or restructurings may adversely affect us our ability to obtain regulatory approval of acquisitions is subject to constraints related to the bank secrecy act and the cra  as described above in business supervision and regulation and below in md a regulatory matters 
subject to our ability to address successfully these regulatory concerns  we may seek to acquire or invest in financial and non financial companies that complement our business 
we may not be successful in completing any such acquisition or investment as this will depend on the availability of prospective target opportunities at valuation levels we find attractive and the competition for such opportunities from other parties 
in addition  we continue to evaluate the performance of all of our businesses and business lines and may sell or restructure a business or business line 
any acquisitions  divestitures or restructurings may result in the issuance of potentially dilutive equity securities  significant write offs  including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets  and or the incurrence of debt  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
acquisitions  divestitures or restructurings could involve numerous additional risks including difficulties in obtaining any required regulatory approvals and in the assimilation or separation of operations  services  products and personnel  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  higher than expected deposit attrition  divestitures required by regulatory authorities  the disruption of our business  the potential loss of key employees and unexpected contingent liabilities arising from any business we might acquire 
we may not be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered in connection with any acquisition we might make 
privacy restrictions could adversely affect our business our business model relies  in part  upon cross marketing the products and services offered by us and our subsidiaries to our customers 
laws that restrict our ability to share information about customers within our corporate organization could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we rely on third parties for important products and services third party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections  network access and mutual fund distribution and we do not control their actions 
any problems caused by these third parties  including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly  could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise to conduct our business 
replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense 
significant legal actions could subject us to substantial uninsured liabilities we are from time to time subject to claims related to our operations 
these claims and legal actions  including supervisory or enforcement actions by our regulators  could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs 
to protect ourselves from the cost of these claims  we maintain insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations 
however  our insurance coverage may not cover all claims against us or continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost 
as a result  we may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities  which could adversely affect our business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
changes in our tax rates could affect our future results the state of california requires us to file our franchise tax returns as a member of a unitary group that includes mitsubishi ufj financial group and either all worldwide affiliates or only us affiliates 
our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by increases or decreases in mitsubishi ufj financial group s taxable profits  which in turn are affected by changes in the worldwide economy  especially in japan  and decisions that they may make about the timing of the recognition of credit losses or other matters 
our effective tax rates could also be affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes in tax laws or their interpretation  or by the outcomes of examinations of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our business and revenues as a financial institution  our earnings and capital are subject to risks associated with negative public opinion 
negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities  including lending practices  the failure of any product or service sold by us to meet our customers expectations or applicable regulatory requirements  corporate governance and acquisitions  or from actions taken by regulators and community organizations in response to those activities 
we fund our operations independently of the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj and mitsubishi ufj financial group and believe our business is not necessarily closely related to the business or outlook of the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj or mitsubishi ufj financial group 
however  negative public opinion could also result from regulatory concerns regarding  or supervisory actions in the us or japan against  us or union bank of california  or the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj or mitsubishi ufj financial group 
negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract and or retain customers and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action 
actual or alleged conduct by one of our businesses can result in negative public opinion about our other businesses 
negative public opinion could also affect our credit ratings  which are important to our access to unsecured wholesale borrowings  significant changes in these ratings could change the cost and availability of these sources of funding 
our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to our company our risk management framework is made up of various processes and strategies to manage our risk exposure 
types of risk to which we are subject include liquidity risk  credit risk  market risk  interest rate risk  operational risk  legal risk  compliance risk  reputation risk  fiduciary risk and private equity risk  among others 
our framework to manage risk  including the framework s underlying assumptions  may not be effective under all conditions and circumstances 
if our risk management framework proves ineffective  we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected 
our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management  and recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms 
any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met

additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls 
accordingly  because of the inherent limitations in our control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected
