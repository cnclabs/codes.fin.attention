item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with hudson city bancorp s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements in item  and the other statistical data provided elsewhere in this document 
executive summary our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income  which  in part  is a direct result of the market interest rate environment 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  primarily mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities  and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  primarily time deposits  interest bearing transaction deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is affected by the shape of the market yield curve  the timing of the placement and repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on our balance sheet  and the prepayment rate on our mortgage related assets 
our results of operations may also be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions  particularly those with respect to changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
our results are also affected by the market price of our stock  as the expense of certain of our employee stock compensation plans is related to the current price of our common stock 
the federal open market committee of the federal reserve bank fomc increased the overnight lending rate times from june through june to  but did not change the rate during the second half of short term interest rates increased due to these changes in the overnight lending rate  but did decrease slightly during the second half of in anticipation of a decrease in the overnight rate 
intermediate term market interest rates  those with maturities of two to five years  and long term market interest rates  in particular the year bond  also increased during  but at a slower pace than the short term interest rates 
the result of these market interest rate changes was the inversion of the market yield curve during the second half of this market rate environment has caused net interest margin to decrease  but we have been able to maintain a slight positive spread on our incremental growth as our primary investment has been in mortgage related products 
we have also experienced higher deposit costs due to increases in short term market interest rates during and the intense competitive pressure for deposits in the new york metropolitan area 
during  we grew total assets by billion  primarily reflecting balance sheet growth funded primarily by borrowed funds and deposits  and a billion increase due to the acquisition 
this growth reflects a billion increase in loans and a billion increase in total mortgage backed securities 
the growth in our loan portfolio was due primarily to residential mortgage loan purchases and originations of billion and billion  respectively  during the growth in total mortgage backed securities reflected purchases of variable rate or hybrid instruments 
the billion growth in total borrowed funds was the result of securing billion of new borrowings at a weighted average rate of 
these new borrowings have final maturities of ten years and initial non call periods of one to three years 
in addition  deposits increased billion  reflecting in part the billion transferred as a result of the acquisition 
our net income increased for to million primarily due to the growth of our interest earning assets due to our second step conversion and stock offering as well as growth funded by deposits and borrowed funds 
basic and diluted earnings per share for were and  respectively  compared with and  respectively  for our return on average stockholders equity was for  as compared to in the decrease reflects an increase in stockholders equity page 
table of contents due to the capital received from our second step conversion and stock offering completed in june our return on average assets decreased to for  when compared to for  reflecting our internally generated balance sheet growth in this flat to inverted yield curve environment 
net interest income increased to million due primarily to the overall growth in our balance sheet 
our total average interest earning assets increased for the year ended december   while the yields over those same periods increased basis points 
our total average interest bearing liabilities increased  for the year ended december  and the average cost increased basis points 
our net interest margin decreased basis points to and our net interest rate spread decreased basis points to when comparing with our interest income  in general  reflects movements in long term rates while our interest expense  in general  reflects movements in short term rates  which have increased over the past two years at a faster pace than long term rates 
these decreases in the net interest margin and net interest rate spread were also due  in part  to a shift in our interest earning asset mix to shorter term investment securities and variable rate mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities to help manage our interest rate risk 
in addition  our interest bearing liabilities reset to the current market interest rates faster than our interest earning assets as changes to interest rates on our interest bearing liabilities generally time movements in market interest rates while changes to interest rates on our interest earning assets generally lag market interest rates due to normal commitment periods of up to days 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  during  our total assets increased billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  loans increased billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december   reflecting internal growth initiatives funded primarily by borrowed funds and the addition of million of loans from the acquisition 
the increase in loans reflected our continued purchases of loans as well as our focus on the origination of one to four family first mortgage loans in new jersey  new york and connecticut 
during  we purchased first mortgage loans of billion and originated first mortgage loans of billion as compared to purchases of billion and originations of billion for the larger volume of purchased mortgage loans in  when compared to the volume of loan originations  allowed us to continue to grow and geographically diversify our mortgage loan portfolio at a relatively low overhead cost while maintaining our traditional thrift business model 
we will continue to purchase mortgage loans to grow and diversify our portfolio  as opportunities and funding are available 
our first mortgage loan originations and purchases were substantially in one to four family mortgage loans 
approximately of the mortgage loan purchases and of the mortgage loan originations were variable rate loans 
we purchased a lower percentage of variable rate mortgage loans  when compared to originated mortgage loans  as a large percentage of variable rate loans available for purchase are outside our defined geographic parameters and contain types of variable rate instruments  such as option arm s  that do not meet our underwriting standards 
at december   fixed rate mortgage loans accounted for of our first mortgage loan portfolio compared with at december  at december   we were committed to purchase and originate million and million  respectively  of first mortgage loans  which are expected to settle during the first quarter of total mortgage backed securities increased billion to billion at december  from billion at december  reflecting internal growth initiatives funded primarily by borrowed funds 
this increase in total mortgage backed securities resulted from billion in purchases of securities  all of which are issued by a us government agency or us government sponsored enterprise 
of page 
table of contents these purchases  approximately were variable rate adjustable annually or hybrid adjustable annually after fixed periods of three to seven years instruments 
at december   variable rate mortgage backed securities accounted for of our portfolio compared with at december  at december   we were committed to purchase million of us government agency or us government sponsored enterprise variable rate mortgage backed securities  which are expected to settle during the first quarter of we intend to continue to purchase variable rate securities  such as those mortgage backed securities described above or us government sponsored enterprise step up notes  as well as originate and purchase variable rate mortgage loans in order to grow our fixed rate and variable rate portfolios by equal amounts  as part of our strategy to assist in the management of our interest rate risk 
accrued interest receivable increased million  primarily due to increased balances in loans and investments 
the million increase in other assets included an increase of million of bank owned life insurance transferred in connection with the acquisition 
the acquisition also resulted in the addition of million of goodwill and other intangible assets of million 
total liabilities increased billion  or  to billion at december  compared with billion at december  borrowed funds increased billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the additional borrowed funds were primarily used to fund our asset growth 
we believed the cost of the incremental borrowed funds was lower than the cost of new deposits and therefore used borrowings to fund a substantial portion of our asset growth 
borrowed funds were comprised of billion of securities repurchase agreements and billion of fhlb advances 
new borrowings amounted to billion and have initial non call periods ranging from one to three years  final maturities of ten years  and a weighted average rate of 
total deposits increased billion during  due primarily to a billion increase in total time deposits  billion of deposits from the acquisition  and a million increase in our money market accounts 
these increases were partially offset by a billion decrease in our interest bearing transaction accounts  due to customers shifting deposits to short term time deposits 
we experienced increased competitive pressure and pricing of short term deposits during in the new york metropolitan area 
the increase in time deposits reflected our competitive pricing of these deposits and a shift of our customer preference to short term time deposits 
other liabilities increased to million at december  compared with million at december  the increase is primarily the result of a million increase in the accrued interest payable on borrowed funds and deposits 
total stockholders equity decreased million to billion at december  from billion at december  the decrease was primarily due to repurchases of  shares of outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of million and cash dividends declared and paid to common stockholders of million 
these decreases to stockholders equity were partially offset by net income of million for as of december    shares were authorized and yet to be repurchased under our existing stock repurchase programs 
at december   our stockholders equity to asset ratio was compared with at december  the decrease reflected our strategy to grow assets  purchase outstanding common stock and pay dividends 
for  the ratio of average stockholders equity to average assets was compared with for the year the increase reflected the receipt of the net offering proceeds from our second step conversion and stock offering during at page

net interest income depends on our volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earned or paid on them

table of contents average balance sheet 
the following table presents certain information regarding our financial condition and net interest income for   and the table presents the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated 
we derived the yields and costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown 
we derived average balances from daily balances over the periods indicated 
interest income includes fees that we considered adjustments to yields 
yields on tax exempt obligations were not computed on a tax equivalent basis 
non accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances and therefore have a zero yield 
the yields set forth below include the effect of deferred loan origination fees and costs  and purchase premiums and discounts that are amortized or accreted to interest income 
interest income on loans for   and has been reduced by the amortization of net deferred loan origination costs of  million and  respectively 
interest income on loans for   and has been reduced by amortization of purchase premiums net of discounts of  million  and million for those same respective years 
interest income on mortgage backed securities has been reduced by amortization of purchase premiums net of discounts of million  million  and million for those same respective years

the decrease in the return on average assets also reflected our balance sheet growth during a period of narrowing net interest rate spreads and a flat to inverted market yield curve 
interest and dividend income 
total interest and dividend income increased million  or  to billion for compared with billion for the increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a billion  or  increase in the average balance of total interest earning assets to billion for compared with billion for the growth in the average balance of total interest earning assets was consistent with the growth initiatives employed by us during recent periods and also reflected the receipt of the net offering proceeds from our second step conversion 
the increase in interest and dividend income was also partially due to a basis point increase in the weighted average yield on total interest earning assets to for the year from for the year this increase in the weighted average yield reflected a modest increase in intermediate and long term interest rates experienced during interest and fees on mortgage loans increased million primarily due to a billion increase in the average balance  reflecting increases in our core investment of first mortgage loans 
the increase in mortgage loan income was also due to a basis point increase in the weighted average yield  which reflected the large volume of originations and purchases of mortgage loans during this period of rising intermediate and long term interest rates 
the million increase in interest income on total mortgage backed securities was due to an billion increase in the average balance of total mortgage backed securities  due primarily to the purchase of variable rate securities during to complement our purchases of fixed rate mortgage loans 
the increase in was also due to a basis point increase in the weighted average yield to  reflecting these purchases during this period of rising interest rates 
the million increase in interest and dividends on total investment securities was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of total investment securities of billion  which reflected the investment into short term securities of part of the net proceeds from the second step conversion and stock offering 
the increase in interest and dividends on total investment securities was also due to a basis point increase in the weighted average yield reflecting purchases of securities during this period of rising short term interest rates 
interest expense 
total interest expense increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december  from million for this increase was primarily due to a billion  or  increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities to billion for compared with billion for the increase in interest bearing liabilities was used to fund our asset growth 
the increase in total interest expense was also due to a basis point increase in the weighted average cost of total interest bearing liabilities to for the year compared with page 
table of contents for the year the increase in the average cost reflected the growth and re pricing of our interest bearing liabilities during the rising short term interest rate environment experienced interest expense on borrowed funds increased million primarily due to a billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds and a basis point increase in the weighted average cost of borrowed funds 
the increase in the average balance of borrowed funds was used to fund asset growth 
the increase in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected the new borrowings with a higher rate than the existing borrowings 
the million increase in interest expense on interest bearing deposits for the year was primarily due to an basis point increase in the weighted average cost of interest bearing deposits  reflecting the rising short term interest rate environment  the competitive pricing of our deposit products and a shift by our customers  during to higher costing short term time deposits from our high value checking product 
the million increase in interest expense on our time deposit accounts reflected a basis point increase in the weighted average cost  due to the rising short term market interest rate environment  and a billion increase in the average balance of time deposit accounts 
the million increase in interest expense on our money market accounts primarily reflected an increase in the weighted average cost of basis points  reflecting increases in short term interest rates and the competitive pricing of this product 
the million decrease in interest expense on our interest bearing transaction accounts was primarily due to a billion decrease in the average balance  reflecting shifts to time deposit products 
time deposits accounted for of the average balance of interest bearing deposits compared to during we intend to continue to fund future asset growth using borrowed funds and customer deposits as our primary sources of funds 
we intend to grow customer deposits by continuing to pay competitive  but prudent rates and by opening new branch offices 
net interest income 
net interest income increased million  or  to million for the year compared with million for the year this increase primarily reflected the investment of the net offering proceeds from our second step conversion over the course of a full year and our balance sheet growth initiatives 
the increase due to our growth was partially offset by an increase in the costs of our interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds 
our net interest rate spread decreased basis points to for from for and our net interest margin decreased basis points to for from for market interest rates resulted in an inverted us treasury yield curve during this market interest rate scenario has had a negative impact on our results of operations and our net interest margin as the yields on our interest earning assets have increased far less than the costs of our interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  our interest bearing liabilities will reprice to current market interest rates faster than the yields earned on our interest earning assets 
the increase in the cost of our interest bearing liabilities reflected the rising short term interest rate environment  affecting both our deposits and borrowed funds  and the shift within our deposits to higher costing short term time deposits 
our net interest margin is likely to decrease further if the yield curve remains inverted in provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in the allowance for loan losses was due to the inclusion of sound federal s allowance for loan losses as a result of the acquisition 
the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was at december  compared with at december  we did not record a provision for loan losses during we did record a provision of  during net charge offs for the year were page

although we use the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
see critical accounting policies 
non interest income 
total non interest income decreased million to million for from million for the decrease in non interest income primarily reflected the million decrease in gains on securities transactions as there were minimal realized gains losses from sales of securities that occurred during non interest expense 
total non interest expense increased million  or  to million for from million for this increase is primarily due to increases of million in compensation and employee benefits expense  million in net occupancy expense  and million in other non interest expense 
the increase in compensation and employee benefits expense primarily reflected a million increase in the expense related to our employee stock ownership plan  as a result of increases in our stock price 
the increase also reflected the expense related to stock options that amounted to million during the increase in net occupancy expense is the result of our branch expansion and the addition of branches from sound federal in july the increases in the other categories of non interest expense are due to an increase in professional services of million  operating expenses for new branches and increased costs related to our growth

the increase in interest and dividend income due to the increase in the average balance was partially offset by a decrease of nine basis points in the weighted average yield on total interest earning assets to for the year from for the year this decrease in the weighted average yield reflected a shift in our interest earning asset mix to shorter term investment securities to help manage our interest rate risk 
investments of this type included the purchase of agency discount notes from the second step conversion net offering proceeds  and the origination and purchase of a larger percentage of variable rate mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
the million increase in interest and fee income on first mortgage loans was primarily due to a billion increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans  which reflected our continued emphasis on balance sheet growth in our core investment in first mortgage loans 
the increase in mortgage loan income due to the increase in the average balance was partially offset by a seven basis point decrease in the weighted average yield  which reflected the larger volume of originations and purchases of variable rate loans during  which generally have initial yields that are less than fixed rate loans 
the million increase in interest and dividends on total investment securities was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of total investment securities of billion  which reflected the investment of part of the net proceeds from the second step conversion and stock offering  and the investment of certain of the cash flows from the prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets in into investment securities 
the increase in interest and dividends on total investment securities due to the increase in the average balance was partially offset by a basis point decrease in the weighted average yield reflecting purchases of securities with maturity or initial rate reset dates of less than two years  in order to assist in our management of interest rate risk

the new borrowings had a weighted average rate of 
the increase in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected the continued growth of our borrowed funds in the increasing intermediate and long term interest rate environment that existed during and the million increase in interest expense on interest bearing deposits for the year was due to a million increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits and a basis point increase in the weighted average cost of interest bearing deposits 
the growth in the average balance of interest bearing deposits was primarily used to fund our growth initiatives and was primarily due to increases in our interest bearing transaction account 
the increase in the weighted average cost of interest bearing deposits  experienced principally in interest bearing transaction accounts and time deposits  reflected the rising short term market interest rate environment experienced during and and the need to increase rates on these deposit products in the highly competitive deposit market of the new york metropolitan area 
the million increase in interest expense on our interest bearing transaction accounts reflected an increase in the average balance of interest bearing transaction accounts of million  primarily due to the growth of our high value checking account product  and a basis point increase in the weighted average cost due to the rising short term market interest rate environment 
the million increase in interest expense on our time deposit accounts reflected a basis point increase in the weighted average cost  due to the rising short term market interest rate environment  and a million increase in the average balance of time deposit accounts 
we intend to continue to fund future asset growth using customer deposits as our primary source of funds  by continuing to pay competitive  but prudent rates and by opening new branch offices 
we will continue to supplement deposit growth using borrowed funds 
net interest income 
net interest income increased million  or  to million for the year compared with million for the year this increase primarily reflected the investment of the net offering proceeds from our second step conversion and our internally generated growth initiatives  the combination of which resulted in a larger increase in the average balance of total interest earning assets when compared to the increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities 
the increase due to our growth was partially offset by an increase in the costs of our interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds 
our net interest rate spread decreased basis points to for from for and our net interest margin decreased basis points to for from for the decrease in these ratios was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost of interest bearing liabilities and a decrease in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets 
the increase in the cost of our interest bearing liabilities reflected the rising short term interest rate environment and the borrowing of funds with longer terms to initial reprice or maturity than in previous periods 
the decrease in the yield on our interest earning assets reflected the shift in our investment portfolio to shorter term interest earning assets  accomplished by purchasing and originating a larger percentage of variable rate instruments and purchasing agency discount notes with part of the proceeds from our second step page

the ratio of non performing loans to total loans was at december  compared with at december  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was at december  compared with at december  during  we lowered the loss factors used in our analysis of the loan loss allowance for our first mortgage loans to reflect the seasoning of the purchased loan portfolio and the recent favorable charge off experience and delinquency trends 
as a result of these trends  we recorded no provision during the second  third and fourth quarters of and a minimal provision for loan losses in the year to reflect probable losses resulting from the actual growth in our loan portfolio 
we consider the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans at december   given our primary lending emphasis and current market conditions  to be adequate 
although we believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels  additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment 
although we use the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
see critical accounting policies 
non interest income 
total non interest income decreased million to million for from million for the decrease in non interest income primarily reflected the decrease in gains on securities transactions  net  as no sales of securities occurred during the second  third or fourth quarters of  and minimal sales occurred in the first quarter of non interest expense 
total non interest expense increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase primarily reflected normal salary adjustments  and increases in net occupancy expense  employee compensation and advertising expense due to our branch expansion program 
our efficiency ratio was for the year compared with for the year our ratio of non interest expense to average total assets for was compared with for the decrease in these ratios reflected our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure to support continuing asset growth while controlling operating expenses  as our average assets grew in excess of during income taxes

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the term liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to fund loan originations  loan and security purchases  deposit withdrawals  repayment of borrowings and operating expenses 
our primary sources of funds are scheduled amortization and prepayments of loan principal and mortgage backed securities  deposits  borrowed funds  maturities and calls of investment securities and funds provided by our operations 
our membership in the fhlb provides us access to additional sources of borrowed funds  which is generally limited to approximately twenty times the amount of fhlb stock owned 
we also have the ability to access the capital markets from time to time  depending on market conditions 
our investment policy provides that we shall maintain a primary liquidity ratio  which consists of cash  federal funds sold  securities with remaining maturities of less than five years and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities repricing within one year  in an amount equal to at least of total deposits and short term borrowings 
at december   our primary liquidity ratio was 
deposit flows  calls of investment securities and borrowed funds  and prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities are strongly influenced by interest rates  general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace 
these factors reduce the predictability of the timing of these sources of funds 
as mortgage interest rates decline  customer prepayment activity tends to accelerate causing an increase in cash flow from both our mortgage loan and mortgage backed security portfolios 
if our pricing is competitive  the demand for mortgage originations also accelerates 
when mortgage rates increase  the opposite effect on prepayment activity tends to occur and our loan origination and purchase activity becomes increasingly dependent on the strength of our residential real estate market and the volume of home purchases and new construction activity in the markets we serve 
principal repayments on loans were billion during the year compared with billion for the year the decrease in payments on loans reflected the slowing prepayment rate on mortgage loans due to the rising interest rate environment during principal payments received on mortgage backed securities totaled billion during compared with billion during the increase in payments on mortgage backed securities reflected the growth of our primarily variable rate portfolio and the fact that the prepayment rates on variable rate instruments remained high as customers refinanced to fixed rate instruments 
maturities and calls of investment securities during were million compared with maturities and calls totaling billion for the decrease in maturities and calls reflected the rising interest rate environment resulting in a decrease in call activity 
total deposits increased billion during the year compared with a decrease of million during the year deposit flows  in general  are affected by the level of market interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by competitors  the volatility of equity markets  and other factors 
the increase in deposits during was primarily due to the acquisition and increases in short term time deposits and money market accounts  reflecting the competitive pricing of these deposit types 
the decrease in deposits during reflected the use of deposit balances by customers to purchase common stock during our second step conversion and stock offering 
time deposit accounts scheduled to mature within one year were billion at december  we anticipate that we will have sufficient resources to meet this current funding commitment 
based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy  we anticipate that a significant portion of these time deposits will remain with us as renewed time deposits or transfers to other deposit products at the prevailing interest rate 
we are page 
table of contents committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position  therefore we monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis 
for the year  we borrowed an additional billion compared with new borrowings of billion for the year we made billion in principal payments on borrowed funds during compared with million for the funds borrowed during all have initial non call periods ranging from one to three years and final maturities of ten years  and were primarily used to fund our asset growth 
at december  we had billion in borrowed funds  with a weighted average rate of  which have the potential to be called within one year 
we anticipate we will have sufficient resources to meet this funding commitment by borrowing new funds at the prevailing market interest rate  or by paying off the borrowed funds as they are called with internally generated cash 
our primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of one to four family real estate loans and consumer and other loans  the purchase of mortgage backed securities  and the purchase of investment securities 
we originated total loans of billion during the year compared with billion during the year of the first mortgage loan originations during  were variable rate loans 
during the year we purchased total loans of billion compared with billion during the year these continued strong levels of mortgage loan originations and purchases  which were funded primarily by borrowed funds  reflected the internal growth initiatives we have employed during recent periods 
the slight decrease in combined originations and purchases reflected the decrease in loan prepayments due to the rising interest rate environment 
the continued larger volume of purchased mortgage loans during  when compared to originated loans  allowed us to grow and geographically diversify our mortgage loan portfolio at a relatively low overhead cost while maintaining our traditional thrift business model 
we will continue to purchase mortgage loans to grow and diversify our portfolio  as opportunities and funding are available 
purchases of mortgage backed securities during the year were billion compared with billion during the year of the mortgage backed securities purchased during  were variable rate securities 
during  we purchased billion of investment securities compared with billion during the decrease in purchases of investment securities reflected the lower amount of cash flows available for investment during due to the rising interest environment and the reinvestment of cash flows into loan originations and purchases 
as part of the membership requirements of the fhlb  we are required to hold a certain dollar amount of fhlb common stock based on our asset size or our borrowings from the fhlb 
during the year  we purchased an additional million in fhlb common stock compared with purchases of million during the purchases of additional fhlb common stock were necessitated by increases in the amount of our outstanding borrowings with the fhlb 
the additional purchases made during brought our total investment in fhlb stock to million  the amount we are currently required to hold 
cash dividends declared and paid during were million compared with million during in  hudson city  mhc applied for and was granted approval from the ots to waive receipt of dividends declared by hudson city bancorp 
these waivers of dividend payments were effective for the first six months of beginning in the third quarter of  due to the consolidation of hudson city  mhc into hudson city bancorp as part of the second step conversion  dividends were paid on all outstanding shares of hudson city bancorp common stock 
the dividend pay out ratio using amount per share information  which does not reflect the dividend waiver by hudson city  mhc in periods prior to the third quarter of  was for the year compared with for the year on january   the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per common share

under our stock repurchase programs  shares of hudson city bancorp common stock may be purchased in the open market and through other privately negotiated transactions  from time to time  depending on market conditions 
the repurchased shares are held as treasury stock for general corporate use 
during the year  we purchased  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million 
during most of the year  our stock repurchase program was suspended pending the completion of our second step conversion and stock offering 
we did  however  purchase  shares  at an aggregate cost of million  which were vesting in our recognition and retention plan and were surrendered by plan participants for the payment of income taxes 
in june  the board of directors approved our seventh stock repurchase program to repurchase up to  shares of common stock

these ratios reflect the billion contribution of net offering proceeds from hudson city bancorp 
the primary source of liquidity for hudson city bancorp  the holding company of hudson city savings  is capital distributions from the banking subsidiary 
during  hudson city bancorp received million in dividend payments from hudson city savings  which amounted to approximately of hudson city savings net income for that period 
the primary use of these funds is the payment of dividends to our shareholders and the repurchase of our common stock 
hudson city bancorp s ability to continue these activities is solely dependent upon capital distributions from hudson city savings

table of contents commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend money to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments to fund first mortgage loans generally have fixed expiration dates of approximately days and other termination clauses 
since some commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
hudson city savings evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
additionally  we have available home equity  overdraft and commercial construction lines of credit  which do not have fixed expiration dates  of approximately million  million  and million 
we are not obligated to advance further amounts on credit lines if the customer is delinquent  or otherwise in violation of the agreement 
the commitments to purchase first mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities had a normal period from trade date to settlement date of approximately days 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fasb interpretation no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the application of fasb interpretation no 
is not expected to have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the fasb believes the standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
statement applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the application of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 which expresses the sec staff s views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements 
the approaches used in practice to accumulate and quantify misstatements are referred to as the rollover and iron curtain approaches 
the rollover approach quantifies a misstatement based on the amount of the error originating in the current year income statement 
the iron curtain approach quantifies a misstatement based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current year  irrespective of the misstatement s year of origination 
the staff believes registrants must quantify the impact of correcting all misstatements  including both the carryover and reversing effects of prior year misstatements  on the current year financial statements 
this can be accomplished by quantifying an error under both the rollover and iron curtain approaches and by evaluating the error measured under each approach 
sab no 
became effective for the company as of december  the application of sab no 
did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements of hudson city bancorp have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  commonly referred as gaap 
gaap generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation 
critical accounting policies we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to understanding our financial results 
in addition  note to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this report contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
we believe our policies with respect to the methodology for our determination of the allowance for loan losses and asset impairment judgments  including other than temporary declines in the value of our securities  involve a higher degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
changes in these judgments  assumptions or estimates could cause reported results to differ materially 
these critical policies and their application are continually reviewed by management  and are periodically reviewed with the audit committee and our board of directors 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses has been determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  under which we are required to maintain adequate allowances for loan losses 
we are responsible for the timely and periodic determination of the amount of the allowance required 
we believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover specifically identifiable loan losses  as well as estimated losses inherent in our portfolio for which certain losses are probable but not specifically identifiable 
our primary lending emphasis is the origination and purchase of one to four family first mortgage loans on residential properties and  to a lesser extent  second mortgage loans on one to four family residential properties resulting in a loan concentration in residential first mortgage loans at december  as a result of our lending practices  we also have a concentration of loans secured by real property located in new jersey  new york and connecticut 
based on the composition of our loan portfolio and the growth in our loan portfolio  we believe the primary risks inherent in our portfolio are increases in interest rates  a decline in the economy  generally  and a decline in real estate market values 
any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies  loan losses and future levels of provisions 
we consider it important to maintain the ratio of our allowance for loan losses to total loans at an acceptable level given current economic conditions  interest rates and the composition of our portfolio 
page 
table of contents due to the nature of our loan portfolio  our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses is performed on a pool basis 
we evaluated the multi family and commercial mortgage  construction and unsecured commercial loans transferred in the acquisition in a similar manner as our previously existing portfolio 
each month we categorize the loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type one to four family  multi family  etc  loan source originated or purchased and payment status ie  current or number of days delinquent 
loans with known potential losses are categorized separately 
we assign potential loss factors to the payment status categories on the basis of our assessment of the potential risk inherent in each loan type 
these factors are periodically reviewed for appropriateness giving consideration to charge off history and delinquency trends 
we use this analysis  as a tool  together with principal balances and delinquency reports  to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
other key factors we consider in this process are current real estate market conditions in geographic areas where our loans are located  changes in the trend of non performing loans  the current state of the local and national economy and loan portfolio growth 
we maintain the allowance for loan losses through provisions for loan losses that we charge to income 
we charge losses on loans against the allowance for loan losses when we believe the collection of loan principal is unlikely 
we establish the provision for loan losses after considering the results of our review of delinquency and charge off trends  the allowance for loan loss analysis  the amount of the allowance for loan losses in relation to the total loan balance  loan portfolio growth  us generally accepted accounting principles and regulatory guidance 
we have applied this process consistently and we have made minimal changes in the estimation methods and assumptions that we have used 
hudson city defines the population of potential impaired loans to be all non accrual commercial real estate and multi family loans 
impaired loans are individually assessed to determine that the loan s carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the collateral or the present value of the loan s expected future cash flows 
smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment  such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans  are specifically excluded from the impaired loan portfolio 
we believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels 
additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment 
although management uses the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
for additional information  see item business allowance for loan losses for a detailed description of how we determine the allowance for loan losses 
asset impairment judgments 
certain of our assets are carried in our consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to recognize impairment of such assets 
we periodically perform analyses to test for impairment of various assets 
in addition to our impairment analyses related to loans discussed above  another significant impairment analysis relates to the value of other than temporary declines in the value of our securities 
our available for sale portfolio is carried at estimated fair value  with any unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity 
the securities which we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
we conduct a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the value of any security has declined below its carrying value and whether such decline is other than temporary 
page 
table of contents if such decline is deemed other than temporary  we would adjust the carrying amount of the security by writing down the security to fair market value through a charge to current period operations 
the market values of our securities are significantly affected by changes in interest rates 
in general  as interest rates rise  the market value of fixed rate securities will decrease  as interest rates fall  the market value of fixed rate securities will increase 
with significant changes in interest rates  we evaluate our intent and ability to hold the security to maturity or for a sufficient time to recover the recorded principal balance 
estimated fair values for securities are based on published or securities dealers market values 
stock based compensation we recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards for all awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled after january  in accordance with sfas no 
r 
for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service was not rendered as of january   the recognition of the cost of employee services is based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under sfas no 
for pro forma disclosures 
we estimate the per share fair value of option grants on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model using assumptions for the expected dividend yield  expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected option term 
these assumptions are based on our analysis of our historical option exercise experience and our judgments regarding future option exercise experience and market conditions 
these assumptions are subjective in nature  involve uncertainties and  therefore  cannot be determined with precision 
the black scholes option pricing model also contains certain inherent limitations when applied to options that are not traded on public markets 
the per share fair value of options is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions 
in general  the per share fair value of options will move in the same direction as changes in the expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected option term  and in the opposite direction as changes in the expected dividend yield 
for example  the per share fair value of options will generally increase as expected stock price volatility increases  risk free interest rate increases  expected option term increases and expected dividend yield decreases 
the use of different assumptions or different option pricing models could result in materially different per share fair values of options 
goodwill goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is tested  at least annually  for impairment at the reporting unit level 
impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
at december   the carrying amount of our goodwill totaled million 
when performing the impairment test  if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
we will test our goodwill for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the identification of additional reporting units or the use of other valuation techniques could result in materially different evaluations of impairment 
pension and other postretirement benefit assumptions 
non contributory retirement and post retirement defined benefit plans are maintained for certain employees  including certain retired employees 
we adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r as of december page 
table of contents  this statement requires an employer to a recognize in its statement of financial condition an asset for a plan s overfunded status or a liability for a plan s underfunded status  b measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year  and c recognize  in comprehensive income  changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur 
the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position is effective for the company as of december  we provide our actuary with certain rate assumptions used in measuring our benefit obligation 
the most significant of these is the discount rate used to calculate the period end present value of the benefit obligations  and the expense to be included in the following year s financial statements 
a lower discount rate will result in a higher benefit obligation and expense  while a higher discount rate will result in a lower benefit obligation and expense 
the discount rate assumption was determined based on a cash flow yield curve model specific to our pension and post retirement plans 
we compare this rate to certain market indices  such as long term treasury bonds  or the moody s or merrill lynch bond indices  for reasonableness 
a discount rate of was selected for the december  measurement date and the expense calculation 
for our pension plan  we also assumed a rate of salary increase of for future periods 
this rate is comparable to actual salary increases experienced over prior years 
we assumed a return on plan assets of for future periods 
we actuarially determine the return on plan assets based on actual plan experience over the previous ten years 
the actual return on plan assets was for for our post retirement benefit plan  the assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure the expected cost of other benefits for was 
the rate was assumed to decrease gradually to for and remain at that level thereafter 
changes to the assumed health care cost trend rate are expected to have an immaterial impact as we capped our obligations to contribute to the premium cost of coverage to the post retirement health benefit plan at the premium level 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk as a financial institution  our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
our net income is primarily based on net interest income  and fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of both income and expense recorded on a large portion of our assets and liabilities 
fluctuations in interest rates will also affect the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those that possess a short term to maturity 
during  the market yield curve inverted  primarily due to increases in short term market interest rates 
this interest rate environment had an adverse impact on our net interest income as our interest bearing liabilities generally reflect movements in short term rates  while our interest earning assets  a majority of which have initial terms to maturity or repricing greater than one year  generally reflect movements in long term interest rates 
the impact of interest rate changes on our interest income is generally felt in later periods than the impact on our interest expense due to differences in the timing of the maturities  repayments and repricing of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the timing of the placement of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on our balance sheet  also had an adverse impact on our net interest income as our interest bearing liabilities generally time market rate movements while our interest earning assets lag market rates due to commitment periods 
page 
table of contents also impacting our net interest income and net interest rate spread is the level of prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets 
the actual amount of time before mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are repaid can be significantly impacted by changes in market interest rates and mortgage prepayment rates 
mortgage prepayment rates will vary due to a number of factors  including the regional economy in the area where the underlying mortgages were originated  seasonal factors  demographic variables and the assumability of the underlying mortgages 
however  the major factors affecting prepayment rates are prevailing interest rates  related mortgage refinancing opportunities and competition 
generally  the level of prepayment activity directly affects the yield earned on those assets  as the payments received on the interest earning assets will be reinvested at the prevailing market interest rate 
prepayment rates are generally inversely related to the prevailing market interest rate  thus  as market interest rates increase  prepayment rates tend to decrease 
the primary objectives of our interest rate risk management strategy are to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in our balance sheet accounts  determine the appropriate level of interest rate risk given our business plan  the current business environment and our capital and liquidity requirements  and manage interest rate risk in a manner consistent with the approved guidelines and policies set by our board of directors 
we seek to manage our asset liability mix to help minimize the impact that interest rate fluctuations may have on our earnings 
to achieve the objectives of managing interest rate risk  our asset liability committee meets weekly to discuss and monitor the market interest rate environment compared to interest rates that are offered on our products 
this committee consists of the chief executive officer  the chief operating officer  the chief financial officer and other senior officers of the institution as required 
the asset liability committee presents periodic reports to the board of directors at its regular meetings and  on a quarterly basis  presents a comprehensive report addressing the results of activities and strategies and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on our results of operations and the present value of our equity 
historically  our lending activities have emphasized one to four family fixed rate first and second mortgage loans 
our growth in variable rate mortgage related assets has helped reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and is expected to benefit our long term profitability  as the rate earned on the mortgage loan will increase as prevailing market rates increase 
however  the prevailing interest rate environment  and the desires of our customers  has resulted in a demand for long term hybrid and fixed rate first mortgage loans 
this may have an adverse impact on our net interest income  particularly in a rising interest rate environment 
in the past several years  we have been originating a larger percentage of variable rate assets in order to better manage our interest rate risk 
included in variable rate loans and securities are loans or securities with a contractual annual rate adjustment after an initial fixed rate period of one to ten years 
these variable rate instruments are more rate sensitive  given the potential interest rate adjustment  than the long term fixed rate investments we currently hold in our portfolio 
variable rate products constituted of loan originations  of loan purchases and of mortgage backed security purchases made during the year in aggregate  of our mortgage related asset originations and purchases had variable rates 
of the growth in our total mortgage related assets  was due to growth in our variable rate products 
page 
table of contents the strategy to originate and purchase a larger percentage of variable rate assets  has lowered our percentage of fixed rate interest earning assets to total interest earning assets to at december  from at december  notwithstanding the decrease in the percentage of fixed rate interest earning assets to total interest earning assets  our fixed rate interest earning assets may have an adverse impact on our earnings in a rising rate environment as the interest rate on these interest earning assets would not reprice to current market interest rates as fast as the interest rates on our interest bearing deposits and callable borrowed funds 
the strategy to originate a higher percentage of variable rate instruments may also have an adverse impact on our net interest income and net interest margin as variable rate interest earning assets generally have initial interest rates lower than alternative fixed rate investments 
in  we intend to originate and purchase similar percentages to of variable rate mortgage related assets 
our primary source of funds has been deposits  consisting primarily of time deposits and interest bearing demand accounts and borrowings 
our deposits have substantially shorter terms to maturity than our mortgage loan portfolio and borrowed funds 
the borrowings are generally long term to maturity  in an effort to offset our short term deposit liabilities and assist in managing our interest rate risk 
these long term borrowings have call options that could shorten their maturities in a changing interest rate environment 
we intend to continue to grow our borrowed funds  as part of our interest rate risk management strategy with new borrowings having maturities of ten years and initial non call periods of one to five years 
due to the nature of our operations  we are not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
our real estate loan portfolio  the majority of which is located in new jersey  new york and connecticut  is subject to risks associated with the local economy 
we do not own any trading assets 
we did not engage in any hedging transactions that use derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps during the year and did not have any such hedging transactions in place at december  simulation model 
we use a simulation model as our primary means to calculate and monitor the interest rate risk inherent in our portfolio 
this model reports net interest income and the present value of equity in different interest rate environments  assuming an instantaneous and permanent interest rate shock to all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
we assume maturing or called instruments are reinvested into the same type of product  with the rate earned or paid reset to our currently offered rate for loans and deposits  or the current market rate for securities and borrowed funds 
our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are generally reported at the earlier of their maturity date or next rate reset date  subject to assumptions regarding prepayment rates  non maturity deposit decay rates  and the call of certain of our investment securities and borrowed funds 
assumptions regarding prepayment and deposit decay rates can have a significant impact on the simulation model 
while we believe our assumptions are reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment and decay rates will approximate actual future prepayment and withdrawal activity 
significant increases in market interest rates may tend to reduce prepayment speeds on our mortgage related assets  as fewer borrowers refinance their loans 
at the same time  deposit decay rates may tend to increase in the shorter term periods  as depositors seek higher yielding investments elsewhere 
if these trends occur  we could experience larger negative percent changes in our model results in the varying rate shock scenarios 
the information presented in the table below is based on the following assumptions page 
table of contents we assumed an annual prepayment rate for fixed rate first mortgage loans of of the fhlmc fixed rate index of moderately seasoned loans and an annual prepayment rate for variable rate first mortgage loans of of the fhlmc year balloon index of new loans  we assumed an annual prepayment rate for our mortgage backed securities using the prepayment rate associated with the security type  for savings accounts that had no stated maturity  we used decay rates the assumed rate at which the balance of existing accounts would decline of in less than six months  in six months to one year  in one year to two years  in two years to three years  in three years to five years  and in more than five years  for our high value checking product  which is included in interest bearing transaction accounts  we used decay rates of in less than six months  in six months to one year  in one to two years  in two to three years  in three to five years  and in more than five years  for other interest bearing transaction accounts that had no stated maturity  we used decay rates of in less than six months  in six months to one year  in one to two years  in two to three years  in three years to five years  and in more than five years  for money market accounts that had no stated maturity  we used decay rates of in less than six months  in six months to one year  in one to two years  in two to three years  in three years to five years  and in more than five years  and callable investment securities and borrowed funds are shown at the earlier of their probable call date or maturity date given the rate of the instrument in relation to the current market rate environment and the call option frequency  the model assumed no calls of investment securities and billion of calls of borrowed funds over the next year in the current zero basis point change scenario 
as a primary means of managing interest rate risk  we monitor the impact of interest rate changes on our net interest income over the next twelve month period 
this model does not purport to provide estimates of net interest income over the next twelve month period  but attempts to assess the impact of a simultaneous and parallel interest rate change on our net interest income 
the following table reports the changes to our net interest income over various interest rate change scenarios 
our internal policy sets a maximum change of given a positive or negative basis point interest rate shock 
change in percent change in interest rates net interest income basis points page 
table of contents the negative change to net interest income in the positive change scenarios was primarily due to the expected calls  and subsequent reset to higher market interest rates  of our borrowed funds 
the negative change to net interest income in the negative change scenarios was primarily due to the expected calls of our government sponsored agency securities and the acceleration of the prepayment speeds on our mortgage related assets  and the subsequent reset to lower market interest rates of the reinvested assets 
we also monitor our interest rate risk by monitoring changes in the present value of equity in the different rate environments 
the present value of equity is the difference between the estimated fair value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the changes in market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates reflect the interest sensitivity of those assets and liabilities as their values are derived from the characteristics of the asset or liability ie  fixed rate  adjustable rate  caps  floors relative to the current interest rate environment 
for example  in a rising interest rate environment the fair market value of a fixed rate asset will decline  whereas the fair market value of an adjustable rate asset  depending on its repricing characteristics  may not decline 
increases in the market value of assets will increase the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of assets will decrease the present value of equity 
conversely  increases in the market value of liabilities will decrease the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of liabilities will increase the present value of equity 
the following table presents the estimated present value of equity over a range of interest rate change scenarios at december  the present value ratio shown in the table is the present value of equity as a percent of the present value of total assets in each of the different rate environments 
our current policy sets a minimum ratio of the present value of equity to the fair value of assets in the current interest rate environment no rate shock of  a minimum present value ratio of in the plus basis point interest rate shock scenario and a minimum present value ratio of in the minus basis point scenario 
present value of equity as percent of present present value of equity value of assets change in dollar dollar percent present basis point interest rates amount change change value ratio change basis points dollars in thousands the decreases in the present value of equity and the present value ratio in the increasing rate scenarios analysis were primarily due to the high percentage of fixed rate mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities in our portfolio 
at december   fixed rate interest earning assets were of total interest earning assets 
this percentage of fixed rate interest earning assets to total interest earning assets may have an adverse impact on our earnings in a rising rate environment  as these assets will not reprice in a rising rate environment 
page 
table of contents the decreases in the present value of equity and the present value ratio in the decreasing rate scenarios in the december  analysis were primarily due to the growth of our fixed rate borrowed funds with long terms to maturity  which generally do not reprice in a decreasing rate environment 
the methods we used in simulation modeling are inherently imprecise 
this type of modeling requires that we make assumptions that may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
for example  we assume the composition of the interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will remain constant over the period being measured and that all interest rate shocks will be uniformly reflected across the yield curve  regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing 
the table assumes that we will take no action in response to the changes in interest rates 
in addition  prepayment estimates and other assumptions within the model are subjective in nature  involve uncertainties  and  therefore  cannot be determined with precision 
accordingly  although the previous two tables may provide an estimate of our interest rate risk at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income or present value of equity 
gap analysis 
the matching of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a financial institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within that same period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
during a period of rising interest rates  a financial institution with a negative gap position would be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in the costs of its interest bearing liabilities relative to the yields of its interest earning assets and thus a decrease in the institution s net interest income 
an institution with a positive gap position would be expected  absent the effect of other factors  to experience the opposite result 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to reduce net interest income 
page 
table of contents the following table  presents the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which we anticipate to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except for prepayment activity and non maturity deposit decay rates  we determined the amounts of assets and liabilities that reprice or mature during a particular period in accordance with the earlier of the term to rate reset or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
for purposes of this table  assumptions used in decay rates and prepayment activity are similar to those used in the preparation of our simulation model 
borrowed funds are reported at the anticipated call date  for those that are callable within one year  or at their contractual maturity date 
we have excluded originated non accrual mortgage loans of million and non accrual other loans of million from the table 
at december  more than more than more than more than two years three years six months six months one year to to three to five more than or less to one year two years years years five years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets first mortgage loans consumer and other loans federal funds sold mortgage backed securities fhlb stock investment securities total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities savings accounts interest bearing transaction accounts money market accounts time deposits borrowed funds total interest bearing liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percent of total assets cumulative interest earning assets as a percent of interest bearing liabilities as indicated in the gap table our interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year exceeded our interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period by billion compared with billion at december  this represented a cumulative one year interest rate sensitivity gap as a percent of total assets of negative at december   compared with negative at december  the change in these ratios  year to year  was partially due to the larger amount of anticipated calls of borrowed funds in the current year and a shift of our customer deposits to time deposit maturities of less than one year  due to internal pricing strategies 
the methods used in the gap table are inherently imprecise 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities  have features that limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the loan 
if interest rates change  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of borrowers to make payments on their adjustable rate loans may decrease if interest rates increase
