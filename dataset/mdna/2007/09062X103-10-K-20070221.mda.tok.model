unless required by law  we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k  beginning on page f overview biogen idec inc was formed in upon the acquisition of biogen  inc by idec pharmaceutical corporation in a merger transaction  or the merger 
biogen idec inc is an international biotechnology company that creates new standards of care in oncology  neurology  immunology and other specialty areas of unmet medical need 
we currently have five products avonex interferon beta a  rituxan rituximab  tysabri natalizumab  fumaderm dimethylfumarate and monoethylfumarate salts  and  zevalin ibritumomab tiuxetan 
during the third quarter of  we began executing a plan to divest our zevalin product line 
additionally  through april  we recorded product revenues from sales of amevive alefacept 
in april  we sold the worldwide rights to this product to astellas pharma us  inc  or astellas 
we will continue to manufacture and supply this product to astellas for a period of up to years 
under the terms of the supply agreement  we charge astellas fixed amounts based on volume 
such amounts will be recognized as corporate partner revenue and are not expected to be significant 
significant events the significant events that occurred during were as follows reintroduction of tysabri tysabri was reapproved for sale in the united states and approved for sale in europe in june no product was shipped or revenue recorded during the six months ended june   but we began shipping product and recognizing revenue from tysabri sales of product in the third quarter of acquisition of fumapharm ag  or fumapharm in june  we completed the acquisition of fumapharm 
the most significant financial statement impact resulting from this purchase was the recognition of an 
table of contents acquired in process research and development  or ipr d  charge of approximately million 
the charge was offset by a gain of million on the settlement of a pre existing associated license agreement 
acquisition of conforma therapeutics corporation  or conforma in may  we completed the acquisition of conforma 
the most significant financial statement impact resulting from this purchase was the recognition of an ipr d charge of approximately million 
sale of amevive as noted above  in april  we sold the worldwide rights to amevive  including inventory on hand  to astellas 
planned divestiture of zevalin during the third quarter of  we began executing a plan to divest our zevalin product line 
collaborations and other agreements during the third quarter of we entered into collaboration agreements with mondobiotech ag  or mondo  alnylam pharmaceuticals  inc  or alnylam  and ucb  sa  or ucb 
upfront payments made or payable under the collaboration agreements totaled million  all of which have been expensed as research and development expense during additionally  during the fourth quarter of  we entered into settlement agreements with fumedica arzneimittel ag and fumedica arzneimittel gmbh  collectively  fumedica 
a loss of million was recognized in connection with one of the agreements 
we sold other non core assets  including nico in february  we sold our clinical manufacturing facility  known as nico  and bio in december  we sold a research facility  known as bio  and recognized a pre tax gain of million 
outlook most of our revenues are currently dependent on two products avonex and rituxan 
in the near term  we are dependent on the successful reintroduction of tysabri to grow our overall revenues and diversify our product offerings 
in the longer term  our revenue growth is dependent on the successful clinical development  regulatory approval and launch of current pipeline products and in licensed or acquired products and programs 
we expect to use our cash  cash equivalents and investments for working capital and general corporate purposes  including the acquisition of businesses  products  product rights  or technologies 
at this time  we cannot accurately predict the effect of certain developments on the rate of revenue growth in and beyond  such as the degree of market acceptance  the impact of competition  the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and the outcome of our current efforts to develop  receive approval for and successfully launch our near term product candidates 
marketed products continued growth of global avonex sales is dependent on maintaining avonex s position as the most prescribed multiple sclerosis  or ms  therapy in the us and growing avonex market share outside the us in both the us and globally  we face increasing competition in the ms market from currently marketed products and future products in late stage development 
we continue to generate data showing avonex to be an effective and safe choice for ms patients and physicians 
the majority of rituxan sales are currently from use in the oncology setting 
we believe there is additional room for rituxan sales growth in oncology  particularly in the so called maintenance setting of non hodgkin s lymphoma  or nhl  approved in however  we believe a more significant driver of revenue growth in the future will be the immunology setting  where rituxan is currently indicated for anti tnf tumor necrosis factor  refractory rheumatoid arthritis  or ra  patients 
additional immunology indications for rituxan we are investigating include earlier stage disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs ra  or dmard refractory ra  ms and lupus 

table of contents the us and european tysabri launches are underway 
after establishing the touch risk minimization action plan  or riskmap  program in the us and providing extensive safety education in the us and europe  we are now positioned to deliver the strong efficacy message to the market 
successful reintroduction and sales growth will be dependent on acceptance by physicians and ms patients 
clinical studies over the past few years  we have incurred significant expenditures related to conducting clinical studies to develop new pharmaceutical products and exploring the utility of our existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their respective labels 
for  we expect to continue to incur significant levels of research and development expenditures 
three pipeline products have advanced to late stage registrational trials bg for relapsing forms of ms in phase iii  galiximab for nhl in phase iii  and lumiliximab for chronic lymphocytic leukemia  or cll  in phase iib 
in addition to the expense associated with these late stage trials  other pipeline products are expected to enter proof of concept trials in  driving additional research and development expense 
manufacturing  selling and marketing efforts in  we expect to incur significant expenditures associated with manufacturing  selling and marketing our products 
the aggregate amount of our sales and marketing expenses in will likely be higher than that incurred in  primarily as a result of higher expenses for the ongoing tysabri launch in the us and europe 
business development as part of our business strategy  we plan to consider and  as appropriate  make acquisitions of other businesses  products  product rights or technologies 
our cash reserves and other liquid assets may be inadequate to consummate such acquisitions  and it may be necessary for us to raise substantial additional funds in the future to complete future transactions 
in addition  as a result of our acquisition efforts  we are likely to experience significant charges to earnings for merger and related expenses whether or not our efforts are successful that may include transaction costs  closure costs or acquired in process research and development charges 
other we may experience significant fluctuations in quarterly results based primarily on the level and timing of product revenues  cost of product sales  collaboration revenues  cost and timing of clinical trials  regulatory approvals and product approvals  marketing and other expenses  manufacturing or supply disruptions  and costs associated with the operations of recently acquired businesses and technologies

these increases were offset by lower volume 
for compared to  international sales of avonex increased million  or  primarily due to increases in volume and price  including the impact of patient mix 
foreign exchange accounted for a increase in reported revenues  on a local currency basis  international sales increased 
for compared to  us sales of avonex increased million  or  due to price increases  offset by lower volume 
for compared to  international sales of avonex increased million  or  primarily due to increases in volume and price  including the impact of patient mix 
foreign exchange accounted for a increase in reported revenues  on a local currency basis  international sales increased 

table of contents we expect to face increasing competition in the ms marketplace in and outside the us from existing and new ms treatments  including tysabri  which may impact sales of avonex 
we expect future sales of avonex to be dependent to a large extent on our ability to compete successfully with the products of our competitors 
tysabri revenues from tysabri for the years ended december    and were as follows in thousands tysabri us rest of world total tysabri revenues under the terms of a collaboration agreement with elan corporation plc  or elan  we manufacture tysabri and collaborate with elan on the product s marketing  commercial distribution and on going development activities 
we recognize revenue for sales of tysabri in the us upon elan s shipment of the product to third party distributors 
we recognize revenue for sales of tysabri outside the us at the time of product delivery to our customers 
in november  tysabri was approved by the us food and drug administration  or fda  as a treatment for relapsing forms of ms to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses 
in february  in consultation with the fda  we and elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of tysabri  and we informed physicians that they should suspend dosing of tysabri until further notification 
in  our net revenue associated with sales of tysabri was million  which consisted of revenue of million from sales that occurred prior to our voluntary suspension  offset by an allowance for sales returns of million related to returns of product sold prior to the suspension 
on june   the fda approved a supplemental biologics license application  or sbla  for the reintroduction of tysabri as a monotherapy treatment for relapsing forms of ms to slow the progression of disability and reduce the frequency of clinical relapses 
on june   we and elan announced that the european medicines agency  or emea  had approved tysabri as a similar treatment 
in july  we began to ship tysabri in both the united states and europe 
in  we have recorded revenue on sales of tysabri in the us and europe relating to current activity of million and million  respectively 
prior to the suspension of tysabri in  we shipped product to elan in the us and recognized revenue in accordance with the policy described above 
as a result of the suspension of tysabri  we had deferred million in revenue related to tysabri product that remained in elan s ending inventory 
this amount was paid by elan during and was subsequently recognized as revenue during  as the uncertainty about the ultimate disposition of the product was eliminated 
amevive in  and  sales of amevive were million  million  and million  respectively  of which million  million  and million  respectively  was generated in the us the decrease in total amevive sales for compared to was due to the sale  in april  of our worldwide rights and infrastructure related to sales  production  and marketing of amevive 
the increase in sales in compared to was due to higher sales volumes 
although we sold the rights to this product  we continue to report a small amount of product revenues related to shipments made by certain of our overseas joint ventures 
zevalin in   and sales of zevalin were million  million  and million  respectively  of which million  million and million  respectively  were generated in the us 
table of contents fumaderm fumaderm is a new product being sold by us for the first time beginning in the third quarter of this product line was acquired in our acquisition of fumapharm in june sales for were million  all of which were generated in germany 
provisions for discounts and allowances revenues from product sales are recognized when product is shipped and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  typically upon delivery 
revenues are recorded net of applicable allowances for trade term discounts  wholesaler incentives  medicaid rebates  veteran s administration  or va  rebates  managed care  patient assistance  product returns and other applicable allowances 
the estimates we make with respect to these allowances represent significant judgments that we make with regard to revenue recognition 
provisions for discounts and allowances reduced gross product revenues as follows in millions discounts contractual adjustments returns total allowances gross product revenues percent of gross product revenues our product revenue reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales 
these estimates take into consideration our historical experience  current contractual and statutory requirements  specific known market events and trends and forecasted customer buying patterns 
if actual results vary  we may need to adjust these estimates  which could have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment 
product revenue reserves are categorized as follows discounts  contractual adjustments and returns 
discount reserves include trade term discounts  wholesaler incentives and patient assistance 
for compared to  discounts decreased million  or  reflecting lower amounts of avonex distributed through our patient assistance program 
for compared to  discounts increased million  or  due  principally  to patient assistance providing avonex at higher levels for patients that had been using tysabri prior to its suspension 
contractual adjustment reserves relate to medicaid rebates  va rebates and managed care 
for compared to  contractual adjustments were constant reflecting more activity in the managed care markets  offset by a reduction in medicaid activity due to the introduction of medicare part d  the expanded prescription drug benefit program 
for compared to  contractual adjustments increased million  or due  principally  to the impact of higher reserves for managed care associated with higher level of activity with respect to rebates and medicaid programs associated with price increases 
product return reserves are established for returns made by wholesalers and patients 
in accordance with contractual terms  wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons such as damaged or expired product 
we also accept returns from our patients for various reasons 
for compared to  returns increased million  or  as a result of an adjustment of million to increase reserve levels to correct prior period errors  and higher return experience in these increases were offset by the impact of returns made in connection with the suspension of tysabri in for compared to  returns increased million  or  due  principally  to the expense of million recorded in related to the suspension of tysabri 
reserves for product returns are recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized  resulting in a reduction to product sales 
the majority of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration 
expired product return reserves are estimated through a comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis 
historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product 

table of contents during the second quarter of  we recorded an increase in our allowance for expired products of million to correct for prior period errors 
this increase in the allowance was recorded through an out of period reduction in net product revenue of million and an increase in goodwill of million 
we identified and quantified the errors through an analysis of the historical rate for returns based on volumes of returns and the amount of credit granted to the returning distributors in past periods 
at the time of merger with biogen  inc in  biogen  inc had understated its allowance for expired product by an estimated million due to an incorrect methodology applied in calculating its reserve balance 
had we identified this error at the time of the merger  the recorded goodwill would have been approximately million higher than has been previously reflected 
biogen  inc s methodology was in error because it did not utilize known information in determining critical assumptions used in the basis of calculation 
our application of this incorrect methodology in the post merger period resulted in understating this reserve by an additional million 
in all cases  the correctly calculated rate of return is less than one percent of related gross product revenues 
we have determined that the out of period correction of this error in is not material to our reported results 
additionally  we have determined that the error at the merger date is not material to any prior period balance sheet amounts and the error in the post merger period is not material to any prior period reported results 
unconsolidated joint business revenues we copromote rituxan in the us in collaboration with genentech  inc  or genentech  under a collaboration agreement between the parties 
under the collaboration agreement  we granted genentech a worldwide license to develop  commercialize and market rituxan in multiple indications 
in exchange for these worldwide rights  we have copromotion rights in the us and a contractual arrangement under which genentech shares a portion of the pretax us copromotion profits of rituxan with us 
this collaboration was created through a contractual arrangement  not through a joint venture or other legal entity 
in june  we amended and restated our collaboration agreement with genentech to include the development and commercialization of one or more anti cd antibodies targeting b cell disorders  in addition to rituxan  for a broad range of indications 
in the us  we contribute resources to selling and the continued development of rituxan 
genentech is responsible for worldwide manufacturing of rituxan 
genentech also is responsible for the primary support functions for the commercialization of rituxan in the us including selling and marketing  customer service  order entry  distribution  shipping and billing 
genentech also incurs the majority of continuing development costs for rituxan 
under the arrangement  we have a limited sales force as well as limited development activity 
under the terms of separate sublicense agreements between genentech and f 
hoffman la roche ltd  or roche  commercialization of rituxan outside the us is the responsibility of roche  except in japan where roche copromotes rituxan in collaboration with zenyaku kogyo co ltd  or zenyaku 
there is no direct contractual arrangement between us and roche or zenyaku 
revenue from unconsolidated joint business consists of our share of pretax copromotion profits  which is calculated by genentech  and includes consideration of our rituxan related sales force and development expenses  and royalty revenue from sales of rituxan outside the us by roche and zenyaku 
pre tax copromotion profit consists of us sales of rituxan to third party customers net of discounts and allowances and less the cost to manufacture rituxan  third party royalty expenses  distribution  selling and marketing expenses  and joint development expenses incurred by genentech and us 
under the amended and restated collaboration agreement  our current pretax copromotion profit sharing formula  which resets annually  is as follows biogen idec s share copromotion operating profits of copromotion profits first million greater than million in   and  the threshold was met during the first quarter 
for each calendar year or portion thereof following the approval date of the first new anti cd product  the pretax copromotion profit sharing formula for rituxan and other anti cd products sold by us and genentech will change 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 

table of contents copromotion profits for the years ended december   and  consist of the following in thousands product revenues  net costs and expenses copromotion profits biogen idec s share of copromotion profits net sales of rituxan to third party customers in the us recorded by genentech for were approximately billion compared to billion in and billion in the increase in is due  principally  to the approval by the fda of rituxan for two new indications  ra  and diffuse large b cell lymphoma  and an increase in wholesale prices 
the increase in from was due  principally  to increased market penetration in treatments of b cell nhls and chronic lymphocytic leukemia  and increases in the wholesale price of rituxan 
revenues from unconsolidated joint business for the years ended december   and  consist of the following in thousands copromotion profits reimbursement of selling and development expenses royalty revenue on sales of rituxan outside the us for compared to  reimbursement of selling and development expenses increased million  or 
for compared to  such reimbursements increased million  or 
in both cases the increase was due  principally  to the expansion of the oncology sales force and development costs we incurred related to the development of rituxan for ra 
our royalty revenue on sales of rituxan outside the us is based on roche and zenyaku s net sales to third party customers and is recorded on a cash basis 
royalty revenues in compared to increased million  or  due to increased market penetration and increase in prices 
royalty revenues in compared to increased million  or due to increased sales of rituxan outside the u 
s  offset by a million royalty credit to genentech in the royalty period with respect to all products is years from the first commercial sale of such product on a country by country basis 
rituxan was launched in in most european countries and in in japan 
under the amended and restated collaboration agreement  we will receive lower royalty revenue from genentech on sales by roche and zenyaku of new anti cd products  if and when commercially available  as compared to royalty revenue received on sales of rituxan 
other revenue other revenues consist of the following in thousands royalties corporate partner 
table of contents royalty revenue we receive revenues from royalties on sales by our licensees of a number of products covered under patents that we control 
our royalty revenues on sales of rituxan outside the us are included in revenues from unconsolidated joint business in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
for compared to  royalty revenue decreased million  or 
for compared to  royalty revenues decreased million  or 
in both cases the decreases were due  principally  to decreases in sales levels of products under license and to the expiration of certain contracts 
we receive royalties from schering plough corporation  or schering plough  on sales of its alpha interferon products in the us under an exclusive license to our alpha interferon patents and patent applications 
schering plough sells its intron a interferon alfa b brand of alpha interferon in the us for a number of indications  including the treatment of chronic hepatitis b and hepatitis c 
schering plough also sells other alpha interferon products for the treatment of hepatitis c  including rebetron combination therapy containing intron a and rebetol ribavirin  usp  peg intron peginterferon alfa b  a pegylated form of alpha interferon  and peg intron in combination with rebetol 
beginning in  we no longer receive royalties on sales that are made in italy 
we hold several patents related to hepatitis b antigens produced by genetic engineering techniques 
these antigens are used in recombinant hepatitis b vaccines and in diagnostic test kits used to detect hepatitis b infection 
we receive royalties from sales of hepatitis b vaccines in several countries  including the us  from glaxosmithkline plc and merck and co 
inc we have also licensed our proprietary hepatitis b rights  on an antigen by antigen and nonexclusive basis  to several diagnostic kit manufacturers  including abbott laboratories  the major worldwide marketer of hepatitis b diagnostic kits 
we receive ongoing royalties on sales of angiomax bivalirudin by the medicines company  or tmc 
tmc sells angiomax in the us for use as an anticoagulant in combination with aspirin in patients with unstable angina undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty 
tmc sells angiomax through distributors in europe  canada and latin america 
sales levels  and accordingly  royalty revenues  increased during finally  we hold several patents in japan and taiwan related to the production of synthetic interleukin interleukin is a substance made in the human body that stimulates the proliferation of suppressor cells and is used in the treatment of several types of cancer and chronic viral infections 
shionogi co  ltd 
pays us royalties for use of these patented production techniques 
we anticipate that total royalty revenues in future years will continue to represent a lower proportion of our total revenues 
royalty revenues may fluctuate as a result of fluctuations in sales levels of products sold by our licensees from quarter to quarter due to the timing and extent of major events such as new indication approvals or government sponsored programs 
corporate partner revenues corporate partner revenues represent contract revenues and license fees 
in  we received a million payment from schering ag for the emea grant of marketing approval of zevalin in the eu 
the payment represented  in part  a milestone payment to compensate us for preparing  generating  and collecting data that was critical to the emea marketing approval process as to which we have no continuing involvement

table of contents million  or  due  principally  to the impact of the difference between the cost of avonex inventory recorded at the merger date and its historical manufacturing cost 
a substantial portion of this amount  million  was recognized as cost of sales when the acquired inventory was sold or written down in all of the avonex inventory acquired in the merger was sold or written off by december  tysabri sales of tysabri resumed in july following fda approval to reintroduce the product for certain indications 
because of the suspension in  no product was shipped in subsequent to february the cost of product revenues for is due  principally  to write offs of inventory associated with the suspension of tysabri in the cost of goods sold in represents  principally  the cost of shipments made since july in the us and europe 
we manufactured tysabri during the first and second quarter of and completed our scheduled production of tysabri during july because of the uncertain future commercial availability of tysabri at the time  and our inability to predict to the required degree of certainty that tysabri inventory would be realized in commercial sales prior to the expiration of its shelf life  we expensed million of costs related to the manufacture of tysabri in the first quarter of to cost of product revenues 
at the time of production  the inventory was believed to be commercially saleable 
beginning in the second quarter of  as we worked with clinical investigators to understand the possible risks of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  or pml  we charged the costs related to the manufacture of tysabri to research and development expense 
as a result  we expensed million related to the manufacture of tysabri to research and development expense during at december   there was no carrying value of tysabri inventory on our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   million and million of tysabri inventory value is included in work in process and finished goods  respectively 
in addition  we have product on hand that was written down due to the uncertainties surrounding the tysabri suspension but which is available to fill future orders 
the approximate value of such product  based on its cost of manufacture  was million 
as we sell tysabri  we are realizing lower than normal cost of sales and  therefore  higher margins  as we ship the inventory that was previously written down 
for  cost of sales was approximately million lower due to the sale of tysabri that had been previously written off 
amevive for compared to  cost of product revenue for amevive decreased million  or  due to the disposition of our worldwide rights to the product in april for compared to  cost of product revenue increased million  or 
of this increase  approximately million represented the difference between the cost of amevive inventory recorded at the time of the merger and its historical cost which was recognized as cost of product revenues when the inventory was sold or written off in additionally  in connection with the divestiture of amevive we recorded charges of million to write down amevive inventory to its net realizable value 
this amount was entirely related to the inventory step up recorded at the time of the merger 
zevalin for compared to  cost of product revenue for zevalin decreased million  or  due  principally  to the impairment of certain capitalized patents in and decline in sales volumes 
for compared to  cost of product revenue for zevalin increased million  or  due to inventory write offs and impairments 
fumaderm cost of product revenues for fumaderm was million  which includes the impact of an inventory fair value step up adjustment of million in connection with purchase accounting for the fumapharm acquisition during 
table of contents inventory write offs we periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
if the actual net realizable value is less than that estimated by us  or if there are further determinations that inventory will not be marketable based on estimates of demand  additional inventory write downs may be required 
additionally  our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process 
periodically  certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire 
as a result  included in product cost of revenues were write downs of commercial inventory that did not meet quality specifications or that became obsolete due to dating expiration 
in all cases this product inventory was written down to its net realizable value 
included in cost of product revenues are inventory write downs as follows in thousands avonex amevive zevalin tysabri the write downs were the result of the following in thousands new components for alternative presentations failed quality specifications excess and or obsolescence cost for voluntary suspension of tysabri in  write downs of avonex inventory included million for remaining supplies of the alternative presentations of avonex that were no longer needed after the fda approved a new component for the pre filled syringe formulation of avonex in march the zevalin inventory was written down when it was determined that it would not be marketable based on estimates of demand 
additionally  in the third quarter of  we recorded a charge of million to cost of product revenues related to an impairment of certain capitalized zevalin patents  to reflect the adjustment to net realizable value 
cost of royalty revenues for  and  cost of royalty revenues were million  million  and million  respectively 
gross margin on royalty revenues were approximately   and  respectively 
we expect that gross margins on royalty revenues will fluctuate in the future based on changes in sales volumes for specific products from which we receive royalties 
research and development expenses research and development expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in for compared to  research and development expenses decreased million  or  due  principally  to reductions in salary and benefit expense arising from headcount reductions in million  the elimination of costs related to the nimo facility that was sold in the second quarter of million  and lower expenses for clinical trials  primarily related to tysabri and amevive million 
these decreases were offset by an increase in expenses for new collaborations during the year million  higher clinical manufacturing expense million  and the impact of share based compensation recognized under sfas r in million 

table of contents for  share based compensation expense included in research and development  computed under apb  would have been million 
for compared to  research and development expenses increased million  or  due  principally  to upfront licensing fee and milestones related to a collaboration with pdl biopharma  inc  or pdl million  biopharmaceutical operations and global quality initiatives for our manufacturing activities  including expenses related to the manufacture of tysabri million  increased depreciation and infrastructure expenses million  discovery research initiatives million  and increased pre clinical research activities million 
these increases were offset by a decrease in expenses for our ongoing clinical trials  primarily related to lower than expected clinical trial expenses for tysabri and amevive million 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in for a number of reasons  including our plans to commit significant additional investments in business development and research opportunities 
acquired in process research and development  or ipr d during the quarter ended june   we recorded expense related to ipr d of million 
of this amount  million related to acquired ipr d from the acquisition of fumapharm and million related to acquired ipr d from the acquisition of conforma 
see note  acquisitions and other agreements  of the consolidated financial statements for details on future expenditures with respect to ipr d 
since completing these acquisitions in the second quarter of  we have spent million related to the fumapharm ipr d  and million on the conforma ipr d 
the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these projects are that we will not be able to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology with data from clinical trials and that we will not be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of such projects will materialize  as estimated 
for these reasons  among others  actual results may vary significantly from estimated results 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in for compared to  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  due  principally  to higher expenses related to rituxan in ra million  increased expenses for the re launch of tysabri million  lower reimbursements of costs related to collaboration agreements million  and higher costs related to share based compensation recognized under sfas r in million 
these increases were offset by lower expenses for amevive due to its divestiture million  a decrease in expenses for zevalin million  due in part to the planned divestiture  and also due to the impact of a charge taken in related to a write down of remaining prepaid expense associated with our arrangement with mds canada 
for  approximately million of share based compensation is included in selling  general and administrative expenses in connection with the adoption of sfas r in for  share based compensation expense included in selling  general and administrative expense  computed under apb would have been million 
for compared to  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  due  principally  to the neurology sales force expansion in the us million  increased international neurology sales activities primarily in the eu million  customer service initiatives million  oncology sales and marketing initiatives primarily due to a charge of million related to a write down of remaining prepaid expense associated with our arrangement with mds canada million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in our immunology sales and marketing programs largely due to the pending amevive divestiture million 
included in the increase of selling  general and administrative fees for 
table of contents were administrative expenses  primarily related to consulting fees and grants million  information technology primarily compensation and consulting costs million  and compensation and other costs associated with the retirement of our former executive chairman in december million 
we anticipate that total selling  general  and administrative expenses in will be higher than due to sales and marketing and other general and administrative expenses to primarily support avonex and tysabri 
share based payments our share based compensation programs consist of share based awards granted to employees including stock options  restricted stock  performance share units and restricted stock units  or rsus  as well as our employee stock purchase plan  or espp 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised share based payment  or sfas r 
this statement requires compensation cost relating to share based awards to be recognized in the financial statements using a fair value measurement method

we have tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes available to offset future taxable income 
the utilization of our tax credits may be subject to an annual limitation under the internal revenue code due to a cumulative change of ownership of more than in prior years 
however  we anticipate that this annual limitation will result only in a slight deferral in the utilization of our net tax credits 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and income tax liabilities and projections for future taxable income over the periods that our deferred tax assets are either tax deductible or to which our tax credits may be carried  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the entire benefits of our deferred tax assets

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product revenue and related allowances  royalty revenues  marketable securities and other investments  inventory  income taxes  research and development  in process research and development  derivative and hedging activities  long lived assets  goodwill  contingencies and litigation  and share based payments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about revenue and expense recognition and carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and accounts receivable product revenues we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and title and the risk and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer 
except for revenues from sales of tysabri in the us  revenues from product sales are recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  which is typically upon delivery 
sales of tysabri in the us are recognized on the sell through model  that is  upon shipment of the product by elan to its third party distributors 
revenues are recorded net of applicable reserves for trade term discounts  wholesaler incentives  medicaid rebates  veteran s administration  or va rebates  managed care  patient assistance  product returns and other applicable allowances and the estimates we make with respect to these allowances represent the most significant judgments that we make with regard to revenue recognition

these estimates take into consideration our historical experience  current contractual and statutory requirements  specific known market events and trends and forecasted customer buying patterns 
if actual results vary  we may need to adjust these estimates  which could have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment 
product revenue reserves are categorized as follows discounts  contractual adjustments and returns 
discounts discount reserves include trade term discounts  wholesaler incentives and patient assistance 

table of contents trade term discounts and wholesaler incentive reserves primarily relate to estimated obligations for credits to be granted to wholesalers for remitting payment on their purchases within established incentive periods and credits to be granted to wholesalers for compliance with various contractually defined inventory management practices  respectively 
we determine these reserves based on our experience  including the timing of customer payments 
patient assistance reserves are established to cover no charge product that we distribute to qualifying patients under our indigent program  patient access 
the program is administered through one of our distribution partners  who ship product for qualifying patients from their own inventory that was purchased from us 
the distributor receives a credit at the end of each period for product that was administered during the period  and an accrual is established through a reduction of product revenues for sales made to the distributor which may be used to administer our patient assistance program 
we determine this reserve based on our experience with the amount of activity under the program 
contractual adjustments contractual adjustment reserves relate to medicaid rebates  va rebates and managed care 
medicaid rebates reserves relate to our estimated obligations to states under established reimbursement arrangements 
rebate accruals are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized resulting in a reduction to product sales revenue and the establishment of a liability 
rebate amounts are generally determined at the time of resale to the state  and we generally make cash payments for such amounts within a few weeks of receiving notification from the state 
va rebates or chargeback reserves represent our estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified health care providers at prices lower than the list prices we charge the wholesalers who provide them those products 
the wholesaler charges us for the difference between what the wholesaler pays us for the products and the selling price to the qualified healthcare providers 
rebate accruals are established in the same period as the related revenue is recognized resulting in a reduction in product revenue 
chargeback amounts are generally determined at the time of resale to the qualified healthcare provider  and we generally issue credits for such amounts within a few weeks of receiving notification from the wholesaler 
managed care reserves represent our estimated obligations to third parties  primarily pharmacy benefit managers 
rebate accruals are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized resulting in a reduction to product revenue and the establishment of a liability which is included in other accrued liabilities 
these rebates result from performance based offers that are primarily based on attaining contractually specified sales volumes and growth 
as a result  the calculation of the accrual for these rebates requires an estimate of the customer s buying patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate s to be earned over a contractual period 
in  our estimates required an adjustment of million relating to prior years 
returns product return revenues are established for returns made by wholesalers and patients 
in accordance with contractual terms  wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons such as damaged or expired product 
we also accept returns from our patients for various reasons 
revenues for product returns are recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized  resulting in a reduction to product sales 
the patient return program is administered by the same distribution partner as the patient assistance program 
revenue related to product sold to this distribution partner that is used to satisfy patient returns is fully reserved 
the majority of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration 
expired product return reserves are estimated through a comparison of historical return data to their related sales on production lot basis 
historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product 
as noted below  we have recorded adjustments to the amount of reserves for product returns 
during the second quarter of  we recorded an increase in our allowance for expired products of million to correct for prior period errors 
this increase in the allowance was recorded through an out of period 
table of contents reduction in net product revenue of million and an increase in goodwill of million 
we identified and quantified the errors through an analysis of the historical rate for returns based on volumes of returns and the amount of credit granted to the returning distributors in past periods 
at the time of merger with biogen  inc in  biogen  inc had understated its allowance for expired product by an estimated million due to an incorrect methodology applied in calculating its reserve balance 
had we identified this error at the time of the merger  the recorded goodwill would have been approximately million higher than has been previously reflected 
biogen  inc s methodology was in error because it did not utilize known information in determining critical assumptions used in the basis of calculation 
our application of this incorrect methodology in the post merger period resulted in understating this reserve by an additional million 
in all cases  the correctly calculated rate of return is less than one percent of related gross product revenues 
we have determined that the out of period correction of this error in is not material to our reported results 
additionally  we have determined that the error at the merger date is not material to any prior period balance sheet amounts and the error in the post merger period is not material to any prior period reported results 
other we closely monitor levels of inventory in our distribution channel 
at december   we had approximately weeks of inventory in our distribution channel 
the shelf life associated with our products is  generally between and months  depending on the product 
obsolescence due to dating expiration has not been a historical concern  given the rapidity in which our products move through the channel 
changes due to our competitors price movements have not adversely affected us 
we do not provide incentives to our distributors to assume additional inventory levels beyond what is customary in their ordinary course of business 
royalties we receive royalty revenues under license agreements with a number of third parties that sell products based on technology developed by us or to which we have rights 
the license agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on sales of the licensed product 
we record these revenues based on estimates of the sales that occurred during the relevant period 
the relevant period estimates of sales are based on interim data provided by licensees and analysis of historical royalties paid to us  adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
we maintain regular communication with our licensees in order to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period which they become known  typically the following quarter 
historically  adjustments have not been material based on actual amounts paid by licensees 
there are no future performance obligations on our part under these license agreements 
under this policy  revenue can vary due to factors such as resolution of royalty disputes and arbitration 
marketable securities and investments we invest in various types of securities  including short term and long term marketable securities  principally corporate notes and government securities  in which our excess cash balances are invested  equity securities in certain publicly traded biotechnology companies with which we have collaborative agreements  and equity securities of certain companies whose securities are not publicly traded and where fair value is not readily available 
these investments are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  or apb  the equity method of accounting for investments in common  as appropriate 
in accounting for investments we evaluate if a decline in the fair value of a marketable security below our cost basis is other than temporary  and if so  we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of income 
the factors that we consider in our assessments include the fair market value of the security  the duration of the 
table of contents security s decline  prospects for the investee  including favorable clinical trial results  new product initiatives and new collaborative agreements and our intent and ability to hold to recovery 
the determination of whether a loss is other than temporary is highly judgmental and can have a material impact on our results

inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in  first out  or fifo  method 
included in inventory are raw materials used in the production of pre clinical and clinical products  which are expensed as research and development costs when consumed 
our policy is to capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval  when  based on management s judgment  future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized 
our accounting policy addresses the attributes that should be considered in evaluating whether the costs to manufacture a product have met the definition of an asset as stipulated in fasb concepts statement no 
we assess the regulatory approval process and where the particular product stands in relation to that approval process including any known constraints and impediments to approval  including safety  efficacy and potential labeling restrictions 
we evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints relating to the product and the indication in which it will be used 
we consider our manufacturing environment including our supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could possibly hamper approval or commercialization 
we consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or cause delay in commercialization 
we are sensitive to the significant commitment of capital to scale up production and to launch commercialization strategies 
we also base our judgment on the viability of commercialization  trends in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria 
finally  we consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to realize 
there is a risk inherent in these judgments and any changes we make in these judgment may have a material impact on our results in future periods 
we periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
if the actual net realizable value is less than that estimated by us  or if there are any further determinations that inventory will not be marketable based on estimates of demand  additional inventory write downs may be required 
this periodic review led to the write downs of tysabri inventory as of december  and the expensing of tysabri during  as described above  and may lead us to expense tysabri in subsequent periods 
additionally  our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring throughout the manufacturing process 
periodically  certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire 
as a result  included in product cost of revenues were write downs of commercial inventory that did not meet quality specifications or became obsolete due to dating expiration  in all cases this product inventory was written down to its net realizable value 
during  and  we incurred charges to write down inventory of million  million  and million  respectively 
additionally  in  in connection with the divestiture of amevive  we recorded a charge of million to write down amevive inventory to its net realizable value 
income taxes income tax expense includes a provision for income tax contingencies 
we utilize a best estimate approach for establishing loss contingencies related to income tax uncertainties based on the definition of a liability in fasb concept statement no 
these provisions are adjusted when an event occurs or additional information becomes available that impacts the amounts of our estimates 
while we believe that the amount of the tax estimates is reasonable  it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may differ from provisions for contingencies  and these differences could be significant 

table of contents in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in performing this assessment  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
in making this determination  under the applicable financial accounting standards  we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and the effects of viable tax planning strategies 
our estimates of future taxable income include  among other items  our estimates of future income tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates  we adjust our estimates in future periods we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
on september   we received a notice of assessment from the massachusetts department of revenue for million  including penalties and interest  with respect to the  and tax years 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustment and will vigorously oppose the assessment 
we believe that the assessment does not impact the level of our liabilities for income tax contingencies 
however  there is a possibility that we may not prevail in all of our assertions 
if this is resolved unfavorably in the future based on facts and conditions currently not available to us  this could have a material impact on our future effective tax rate and our results of operations in the period in which an event would occur 
fin assessment we are currently evaluating the impact of fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 on our financial statements 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of upfront fees and milestones paid to collaborators and expenses incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits  facilities expenses  overhead expenses  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses  contract services and other outside expenses 
research and development expenses are expensed as incurred 
the timing of upfront fees and milestone payments in the future may cause variability in future research and development expense 
clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with contract research organizations  or cros 
the invoicing from cros for services rendered can lag several months 
we accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with cro activities based on our estimate of management fees  site management and site monitoring costs  and data management costs 
we maintain regular communication with our cro vendors to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses have not been material and are adjusted for in the period which they become known 
we have entered into certain research agreements in which we share expenses with our collaborator 
we have entered into other collaborations where we are reimbursed for work performed on behalf of our collaborative partners 
we record these expenses as research and development expenses 
if the arrangement is a cost sharing arrangement and there is a period during which we receive payments from the collaborator  we record payments by the collaborator for their share of the development effort as a reduction of research and development expense 
valuation of acquired intangible assets and in process research and development expenses we have acquired  and expect to continue to acquire  intangible assets primarily via the acquisition of biotechnology companies 
these intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and in process product candidates  as well as goodwill arising in business combinations 
when significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired  an independent third party valuation firm is engaged to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date 
discounted cash flow models are typically 
table of contents used in these valuations  and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to estimating the timing and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates 
derivatives and hedging activities we have operations in europe  japan  australia and canada in connection with the sale of avonex 
we also receive royalty revenues based on worldwide product sales by our licensees 
as a result  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily euro  swedish krona  british pound  japanese yen  swiss franc and canadian dollar 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk  but do not engage in currency speculation 
we use these forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  requires that all derivatives be recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
we assess  both at their inception and on an on going basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of hedged items 
we also assess hedge ineffectiveness on a quarterly basis and record the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion to current earnings to the extent significant 
if we determine that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring  we discontinue hedge accounting for the affected portion of the hedge instrument  and any related unrealized gain or loss on the contract is recognized in current earnings 
under this policy  and in accordance with sfas  earnings may vary if the forecasted transaction does not occur  or if there is material hedge ineffectiveness or if the hedge ceases to be highly effective 
long lived assets long lived assets to be held and used  including intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values 
long lived assets to be disposed of are carried at fair value less costs to sell 
during  we incurred charges to write down fixed assets of million 
no charges were recognized in and during and  we incurred charges to write down intangibles of million and million  respectively 
no impairment charges were incurred in goodwill we regularly assess our goodwill balance to determine whether any impairment in this asset may exist and  if so  the extent of such impairment 
to do this  in the case of goodwill we estimate the fair value of each of our 
table of contents reporting units and compare it to the book value of their net assets 
calculating fair value as well as future cash flows requires that we make a number of critical legal  economic  market and business assumptions that reflect our best estimates as of the testing date 
we believe the methods we use to determine these underlying assumptions and estimates are reasonable and reflective of common practice 
notwithstanding this  our assumptions and estimates may differ significantly from actual results  or circumstances could change that would cause us to conclude that an impairment now exists or that we previously understated the extent of impairment 
contingencies and litigation there has been  and we expect there may be significant litigation in the industry regarding commercial practices  regulatory issues  pricing  and patents and other intellectual property rights 
certain adverse unfavorable rulings or decisions in the future  including in the litigation described under legal matters  could create variability or have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial position 
share based payments we make certain assumptions in order to value and expense our various share based payment awards 
in connection with valuing stock options and our employee stock purchase plan  we use the black scholes model  which requires us to estimate certain subjective assumptions 
the key assumptions we make are the expected volatility of our stock  the expected term of the award  and the expected forfeiture rate 
in connection with our restricted stock programs we make assumptions principally related to the forfeiture rate 
we review our valuation assumptions periodically and  as a result  we may change our valuation assumptions used to value stock based awards granted in future periods 
such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share based payments

disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting controls and procedures we have carried out an evaluation  under the supervision and the participation of our management  including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer  of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules a e and d e under the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the securities exchange act  as of december  based upon that evaluation  our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that  as of the end of that period  our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that a the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms  and b such information is accumulated and communicated to our management  including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer  as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 
in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures  our management recognized that any controls and procedures  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives  and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 
changes in internal control over financial reporting we evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in order to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of section requires us to evaluate annually the effectiveness of our 
table of contents internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year  and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in all annual reports 
we have not made any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during that have materially affected  or are reasonably likely to materially affect  our internal control over financial reporting 
management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
internal control over financial reporting is defined in rules a f and d f under the securities exchange act as a process designed by  or under the supervision of  a company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by a company s board of directors  management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors  and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  in making this assessment  management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control integrated framework 
based on our assessment  our management has concluded that  as of december   our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 
our management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp  an independent registered public accounting firm  as stated in their report which appears on page f of this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have operations in europe  japan  australia and canada in connection with the sale of avonex and tysabri 
we also receive royalty revenues based on worldwide product sales by our licensees and through genentech on sales of rituxan outside of the us as a result  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows can be affected by market fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily euro  swedish krona  british pound  japanese yen  canadian dollar and swiss franc 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk but do not engage in currency speculation 
we use these forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar across all maturities for example  a strengthening of the euro would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately million 
our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions 
the quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account operating transactions 

table of contents in addition  the fair value of our marketable securities is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates 
the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical basis point adverse movement across all maturities 
we estimate that such hypothetical adverse basis point movement would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately million to our interest rate sensitive instruments 
we are exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of equity securities included in our portfolio of investments entered into for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
these investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector 
we regularly review the market prices of these investments for impairment purposes 
a hypothetical adverse movement in market values would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately million
