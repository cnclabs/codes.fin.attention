summary the following significant business developments occurred after january  in february  we completed the acquisition of the rapid cardiac immunoassay test business from spectral diagnostics  inc tsx sdi for million in cash and  shares of our common stock with a fair value of approximately million 
the transaction expanded our portfolio of point of care diagnostics to include spectral s cardiac status and decision point product lines  the i lynx reader  related intellectual property and manufacturing capabilities 
the i lynx reader is a unique hand held reader designed to capture and analyze the results of the cardiac status products 
this acquisition provided us a fully integrated point of care group with resources and capabilities in manufacturing and sales and marketing with a worldwide distribution network to compete in the point of care market 

table of contents in march  we received k clearance from the fda to market our statusfirst tm chf nt probnp edta plasma test to aid in the diagnosis of individuals suspected of having congestive heart failure chf 
this was our first k clearance and is considered a significant milestone toward the commercial launch of our chf point of care test 
we are currently considering various product launch alternatives for this product 
in addition  we are continuing our development work on the statusfirst chf whole blood test  which would significantly expand the potential market and revenue generating capability of our chf product 
in march  we sold approximately million shares of our common stock to fisher scientific international  inc at a price of per share in a registered offering  for net proceeds of approximately million 
on may  we completed the acquisition of the diagnostics division of amplimedical spa amplimedical or nanogen advanced diagnostics  which is a manufacturer and distributor of molecular diagnostic products  based in italy  for approximately million consisting of a million payable secured by a letter of credit securitized by restricted cash  the issuance of a million promissory note that was convertible into our common stock  and million in transaction costs 
on june  we paid the promissory note in full by issuing amplimedical  shares of our common stock at a per share conversion price and incurred no interest charges 
based in italy  amplimedical has been active in the european and other markets since the early s with its molecular diagnostic reagents 
nanogen and amplimedical have shared a business relationship for approximately five years  during which time amplimedical has been a distributor of nanogen s nanochip molecular biology workstation and nanochip instrument systems in italy 
we believe this acquisition will allow our molecular diagnostics business to further expand in europe by providing additional resources and scale 
amplimedical s portfolio of real time molecular diagnostic test kits are ce marked for in vitro diagnostics 
amplimedical s diagnostic test kits also include multiplexed reagent kits  sold in europe  such as the ce ivd marked set of reagents used to detect mutations in the gjb gene for the diagnosis of hereditary deafness and a research use only set of reagents to test for genetic causes of beta thalassemia  a type of inherited blood disorder that can cause anemia 
in september  we received a million upfront payment for an agreement with drug royalty trust drt  where we assigned certain rights associated with our applied biosystems royalty agreement from july through december under the agreement with drt  we have guaranteed certain annual minimum royalty payments to drt through for an aggregate minimum amount of million over the term of the agreement 
on october   as a part of our continual focus on narrowing our losses and working towards positive cash flows from operations  we announced a plan to consolidate certain of our north american operations 
as a part of this consolidation process we expect to reduce our headcount by approximately across all of our operations by the end of the first quarter of through a combination of the reduction in force and a limitation on replacements related to normal attrition 
on december  we announced that we were awarded a million contract from the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc to develop a unique multi analyte point of care poc diagnostic assay for influenza in support of the us government s efforts to strengthen its readiness for a potential influenza pandemic 
the current award of million funds the first two phases of a five phase development project and  if all five phases are funded by the cdc  can total up to million over the next two to three years 
on february   we entered into a placement agency agreement with ascendiant securities  llc ascendiant relating to the offering of stock pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement 
under the placement agency agreement  ascendiant agreed to act as our lead placement agent in connection with the issuance and sale of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock  on a best efforts basis  to certain institutional investors 
under this agreement and related 
table of contents purchase agreements with the investors  we sold  shares of our common stock and  warrants for net proceeds of approximately million 
at december   we had approximately million in cash and short term investments 
this compares to our use of approximately million in cash in our operating activities in the year ended december  although we believe we have adequate resources to enable us to operate the business through the end of  due to our negative cash flows from operations we remain dependent on capital financing or other non dilutive sources  such as debt or research and development funding  to continue supporting operations subsequent to december  through the time we attain cash flow positive results 
we can not provide you assurance that we will be able to obtain new sources of financings when and as needed in the future to bridge the gap between our current resources and the cash flow breakeven point 
our business our company is based on the vision of providing a higher quality of healthcare through advanced diagnostic products 
our business strategy is to assemble the companies  products and knowledge base to become a leading supplier of the technologies and products that will help drive a new era of personalized medicine 
we were early to recognize that the adoption of personalized medicine is dependent on the advancement of diagnostic technologies 
the commercialization of our products and technologies will help bridge the gap between early stage scientific research and actual clinical practice 
we are developing several product lines that are directly targeting specific markets within the advanced diagnostics field that have significant potential for revenue growth 
we see successes and a growing capability in the clinical laboratories ability to perform accurate advanced diagnostic testing as a strong validation of our strategy 
in addition  the fda has released guidance encouraging the generation of more pharmacogenomics data and molecular diagnostic testing during drug development and clinical trials  and before the use of medications 
we believe these applications of advanced diagnostics will help build demand for our products and technologies 
technology our diagnostic technologies focus on the identification of the nucleic acid sequences  gene variations and gene expressions associated with both genetic conditions and infectious diseases 
we believe that our research will contribute to a new healthcare paradigm where disease is diagnosed and understood at the molecular level 
we believe that this will lead to the introduction of new therapies  targeted therapeutics and an abundance of new screening tests that will  in turn  shift the focus of medicine to be increasingly proactive as well as being increasingly specific to the individual patient 
our tests will provide doctors with the information they require to tailor specific therapies to the individual patient 
therefore  we have developed a variety of diagnostic tools for both the relatively simple and complex testing required to render disease specific molecular information accessible to researchers and clinicians 
license fee and royalty income developments in january  we renegotiated our royalty agreement with applied biosystems  inc applied biosystems  with the underlying patents expiring at various dates between and  to maintain minimum quarterly payments through december  and royalties based on actual sales  thereafter 
however  actual royalties exceeded the minimum guarantees and there are no longer any guaranteed minimum royalty payments from this agreement 
although we expect this relationship to continue for the foreseeable future  this agreement can be terminated by applied biosystems with a day notice 
in september  we entered into an agreement to assign certain rights associated with our applied biosystems royalty agreement from the period of july through december to drug royalty trust drt for an upfront payment of million 
under the agreement  we have guaranteed minimum royalty payments from applied biosystems to drt 
if the royalty payments fall below certain minimums in a given fiscal year  we are required to pay cash to drt for the difference between the actual royalty payments from 
table of contents applied biosystems and the minimums 
in addition  if royalty payments from applied biosystems are above certain thresholds for a given calendar year we will receive  in cash  a certain percentage of the amount above the threshold 
the table below illustrates the minimum undiscounted payment to drt guaranteed by us for each remaining fiscal year calendar year ending minimum payment in thousands total acquisitions  investments and goodwill developments we actively and selectively seek to acquire or invest in companies with complementary products and strong intellectual property positions to allow us to penetrate emerging markets 
we anticipate using a combination of cash and common stock to purchase future companies or assets 
spectral diagnostics inc asset purchase on february   we completed the acquisition of the rapid cardiac immunoassay test business from spectral diagnostics inc spectral for cash of approximately million and  shares of our common stock with a fair value of approximately million 
based in toronto  canada  the rapid cardiac immunoassay test business includes a portfolio of point of care tests such as the cardiac status and decision point product lines  the i lynx reader  related intellectual property and manufacturing capabilities 
this acquisition provided us a fully integrated point of care group with resources and capabilities in manufacturing  and sales and marketing with a worldwide distribution network to compete in the point of care market 
amplimedical asset purchase on may   we completed the acquisition of the diagnostics division of amplimedical spa amplimedical  which is a manufacturer and distributor of molecular diagnostic products  based in italy  for approximately million consisting of a million payable secured by a letter of credit securitized by restricted cash  the issuance of a million promissory note that was convertible into our common stock  and million in transaction costs 
on june   we paid the promissory note in full by issuing amplimedical  shares of our common stock at a per share conversion price and incurred no interest charges 
under our asset purchase agreement we had the option to pay the promissory note with cash at a discount through june  as such  we reduced the fair value of the promissory note by when we calculated the purchase price 
these factors were among those that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the preliminary allocation of  in goodwill 
based in italy  amplimedical has been active in the european and other markets since the early s with its molecular diagnostic reagents 
nanogen and amplimedical have shared a strong business relationship for approximately five years  during which time amplimedical has been a distributor of nanogen s nanochip molecular biology workstation and nanochip instrument systems in italy 
we believe this acquisition will allow our molecular diagnostics business to further expand in europe by providing additional resources and scale 
amplimedical s portfolio of real time molecular diagnostic test kits are all ce marked for in vitro diagnostics 
amplimedical s diagnostic test kits also include multiplexed reagent kits  sold in europe  such as the 
table of contents ce ivd marked set of reagents used to detect mutations in the gjb gene for the diagnosis of hereditary deafness and a research use only set of reagents to test for genetic causes of beta thalassemia  a type of inherited blood disorder that can cause anemia 
acquisition of synx pharma inc and epoch biosciences  inc 
as a part of our long term strategy to build a stronger company with products to serve the advanced diagnostic marketplace  in  we identified synx pharma inc synx and epoch biosciences  inc 
epoch as businesses operating in market niches that were complementary to our existing business 
in addition  they provided us the opportunity to broaden our product lines in the proteomics technology pipeline eg point of care and real time pcr diagnostic markets 
therefore  we acquired synx and epoch in all stock transactions on april  and december   respectively 
jurilab  ltd investment in a series of investments from july through june  we invested approximately million to purchase of the outstanding stock of jurilab ltd jurilab 
in addition  we have the option to purchase the entire company at not to exceed prices through december  by investing in jurilab  a development stage research and development company  we gained access to technologies related to certain gene markers 
we believe that this investment strategy is an effective use of our cash because it provides us approximately two years to evaluate jurilab s technology for potential commercialization and integration into our product lines before we commit to purchasing the entire entity 
in may  we entered into a collaboration agreement with jurilab  where jurilab would identify and validate new prognostic markers for type ii diabetes with certain milestone payments of up to approximately million 
through december   we paid jurilab approximately  for the completion of certain milestones 
pharmacogenetics diagnostic laboratory  llc beginning in july  we made a series of investments in pharmacogenetics diagnostic laboratory  llc pgx  a development stage research and development company  to provide us access to certain technologies related to pharmacogenetics 
as of december   these investments totaled  our investment  which is carried as other long term assets  is expensed to research and development based on the losses incurred at pgx 
once our investment is reduced to zero  we will stop recording the results of operations of pgx in our financials 
we believe this appropriately reflects the substance of this transaction  which is to fund research and development 
for the year ended december  and we have expensed  and  respectively  of pgx s net losses into research and development 
research and development arrangements with fisher scientific international inc on august   we entered into research and development collaboration arrangements with fisher scientific international inc  fisher scientific a related party  that owns approximately million shares of our common stock  and athena diagnostic  a wholly owned subsidiary of fisher scientific 
we agreed to share certain technology and patent rights related to the development  manufacture and marketing of new molecular diagnostic products 
under these arrangements  fisher scientific has the option to provide us with up to million in and for the research and development of infectious disease and molecular diagnostic tests that will be mutually agreed upon 
these arrangements are included in non binding general agreements  thus the obligation of the parties are subject to further negotiation and final terms of definitive collaboration agreements 
on august   we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with fisher scientific whereby they become the exclusive distributor of our nanogen s mgb alert real time polymerase chain reaction pcr products in the united states 
fisher will have exclusive rights to sell and distribute the products to clinical laboratories 
we recorded approximately  of sales under this agreement in the year ended december  
table of contents fastraq  inc in june  we signed a letter of agreement with fastraq  inc fastraq for the development of a certain future product 
our chief executive officer and chairman of the board  mr 
birndorf  is a director and an investor in fastraq and our newest director  dr 
heiner dreismann  became the ceo of fastraq in in october and december we amended this letter of agreement 
as a result of this agreement and related amendments we made an initial non refundable payment of  in to begin the initial development of this product 
as of december  we expensed the initial  in february  we converted this letter of agreement into two executed contracts  a development and license agreement and a collaboration agreement 
in february  we committed to provide fastraq an additional  in funding based on certain milestones 
as of december    of this incremental commitment had been paid and expensed to research and development 
development and manufacturing agreement with princeton biomeditech corporation pbm developments we were a party to a development and manufacturing agreement between synx and princeton biomeditech corporation pbm to jointly develop and market various point of care tests for certain biomarkers and protein targets 
in the year ended december   we terminated all of our previous agreements with pbm and superseded them with renegotiated manufacturing  distribution agreement and a development contract 
these renegotiated contracts did not include any payments or minimum purchase requirements between the parties 
we agreed to continue the joint development of a point of care test that incorporates pbm s proprietary technology  our proprietary reagents and an exclusive license between us and roche diagnostics gmbh 
pbm is responsible for the development of a reasonably priced instrument for this test to determine the amount of target nt probnp present in a patient 
we will fund a portion of the development cost of the instrument  up to an agreed upon maximum amount which is not material to our financials 
in addition  we are required to develop and manufacture the reagents used in the instrument and supply them to pbm 
we also have to conduct the testing of our reagents required to obtain regulatory approval to market and sell them 
further  we will share revenues associated with this point of care instrument with the majority of revenues being allocated to the party responsible for selling  marketing and distributing the instrument within a specific geographic territory 
each party will be responsible for its own manufacturing  sales and marketing expenses and both parties are required to provide each other a forecast of expected demand for each others product reagents or instruments 
we provided pbm with an option to purchase or to receive a nonexclusive license for certain biological markers for the incorporation into a future point of care instrument related to congestive heart failure  stroke or traumatic brain injury 
we have agreed to negotiate in good faith commercially reasonable terms for such a license or supply arrangement 
however  if we are unable to agree upon such terms pbm will pay nanogen a certain royalty for use of these markers 
acquisitions  investments and goodwill developments we actively and selectively seek to acquire or invest in companies with complementary products and strong intellectual property positions to allow us to penetrate emerging markets 
we anticipate using a combination of cash and common stock to purchase future companies or assets 
other fda regulations developments our micro array instrumentation and asr products are to be used only for research purposes or by clia certified laboratories when developing and validating their own diagnostic tests 
when we begin to distribute and 
table of contents manufacture products for non clia laboratories and point of care customers  we are subject to additional fda requirements such as pre market applications 
in march  we received fda clearance to begin marketing our nt probnp congestive heart failure product for use with human plasma 
for the larger point of care market  our nt probnp congestive heart failure product for use with human whole blood remains under development 
in the third quarter of  we received an untitled letter from the office of in vitro diagnostic devise evaluation and safety oivd  a division of the fda 
the letter described the oivd s concerns that our microarray nanochip systems and certain related asrs might be construed as a medical device that requires a premarket notification application 
during the first quarter of we met with the fda and made certain changes in our marketing materials and sales approach 
in september  the fda published draft guidance for industry and fda staff commercially distributed analyte specific reagents asrs frequently asked questions setting forth the fda s interpretation of the regulations governing the sale of asr products 
subsequently  we received a second letter from the oivd in which the fda asserted that our microarray and multiplexed reagents require fda pre market review 
in november  we met with the fda to discuss the second letter 
we believe that our microarray nanochip systems and asr products are not subject to fda premarket review 
if there is an unfavorable decision by the fda in these matters  it could delay or prevent sales of our nanochip to clinical laboratories in the united states and could adversely impact sales of our asrs to clinical laboratories in the united states 
during  we plan to submit the nanochip with one or more assays to the fda for clearance 
manufacturing except for our custom real time pcr products and specialized manufacturing production businesses  which are make to order businesses  we principally manufacture products for inventory and ship products shortly after the receipt of orders  and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future 
we do not currently have a significant backlog and do not anticipate we will develop a material backlog in the near future 
in addition  we rely on third party manufacturers to supply many of our raw materials  product components  and in some cases  entire products 
hitachi manufactures our nanochip systems and we manufacture the majority of our consumable products in our manufacturing facilities in san diego  california and bothell  washington 
in february  we purchased an advanced diagnostic product line from spectral and acquired the ability to manufacture the associated products in our facilities in toronto  canada 
in may  we purchased an advanced diagnostic product line from amplimedical and acquired the ability to manufacture the associated products in our facilities in buttigliera  italy 
fluctuations we anticipate that our results of operations will fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis and will be difficult to predict 
the timing and degree of fluctuations will depend upon several factors  including those discussed under item a risk factors 
in addition  the timing of orders from distributors and the mix of sales between our product lines could affect our results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve revenue growth on a quarterly or annual basis 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 
table of contents accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of inventory  intangible assets and investments  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 
we consider an accounting estimate and policy to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or the use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
valuation of goodwill we have million of goodwill on our december  consolidated balance sheet related to our acquisitions of amplimedical and spectral in  and our acquisitions of synx and epoch in we used significant estimates and assumptions to determine the value of these assets 
in many cases we use a third party to perform a valuation analysis on these assets  while we review their assumptions  calculations and conclusions for reasonableness and accuracy 
we test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis 
this testing requires that we make judgments to identify our reporting units and requires significant judgments and directly impacts our valuation analysis 
in addition  we test goodwill for possible impairment if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
we assess potential impairments to goodwill assets when there is evidence that events or circumstances indicate that the recorded value of an asset the carrying amount may not be recovered 
these assessments are based on judgments and estimates of the materiality of various on going events and circumstances related to the asset 
indicators of impairment may include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  a significant decline in our stock price or the stock price of comparable companies  a significant decline in our projected revenue or earnings growth or cash flows  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  and a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
the estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with our internal planning and there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process as it is difficult to model all possible future events 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill or intangible assets 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
valuation of intangible and other long lived assets 
we assess the carrying value of intangible and other long lived assets each quarter  which requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the future cash flows of these assets 
the assets are considered to be 
table of contents impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances such as the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset s  and the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
in addition  we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us 
we also periodically review the lives assigned to our intangible assets to ensure that our initial estimates do not exceed any revised estimated periods from which we expect to realize cash flows from the technologies 
if a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates  the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue principally from various real time pcr products both custom and proprietary tests  molecular testing platforms the nanochip systems  various asrs  cardiac tests  sponsored research  contract and grant agreements and from license and royalty fees for intellectual property 
each element of revenue recognition requires a certain amount of judgment to determine if the following criteria have been met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  iv collectibility is reasonably assured  and v both title and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer 
we are required to make more significant estimates involving our recognition of revenue from license and royalty fees  than from revenue generated from our products sales and contracts and grant agreements 
our license and royalty fees revenue estimates depend upon on our interpretation of the specific terms of each individual arrangement and our judgment to determine if the arrangement has more than one deliverable and how each of these deliverables should be measured and allocated to revenue 
in addition  we have to make significant estimates about the useful life of the technology transferred to determine when the risk and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer to decide the period of time to recognize revenue 
in certain circumstances we are required to make judgments about the reliability of third party sales information and recognition of royalty revenue before actual cash payments for these royalties have been received 
inventory and related reserves we have a history of writing down the value of our inventory due to lack of market demand 
we have approximately million of inventory reserves as of december   with a net ending inventory balance of approximately million 
given the inherent unpredictability of demand for new product lines  we were required to make significant estimates about the future demand for this inventory 
our estimates of realizable value are based upon our analysis and assumptions including  but not limited to  forecasted sales levels by product  expected product lifecycle  product development plans and future demand requirements 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts or actual demand from our customers is lower than our estimates  we may be required to record additional inventory write downs 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  inventory previously written down may be sold  resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

table of contents variable interest entities we provide various forms of funding into other entities for business purposes 
examples of these include our investments into jurilab  fastraq and pgx 
finr  consolidation of variable interest entities  requires that we make significant assumptions about these entities ability to generate unrelated additional capital funding and or revenues 
in addition  we are required to make assumptions about the intentions of unrelated parties initial and potential future investments to determine if we are required to consolidate or de consolidate these entities 
if any of these facts  circumstances or assumptions change in the future we maybe required to consolidate or de consolidate these entities operations 
share based compensation share based compensation expense is significant to our financial position and results of operations  even though no cash is used for such expense 
in determining the period expense associated with unvested options  we estimate the fair value of each option at the date of grant 
we believe it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under sfas no 
r 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our valuation methodology  the expected term  expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the risk free interest rate  expected dividends and pre vesting forfeitures 
if any one of these factors changes and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas no 
r will differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
for share based awards issued during the year ended december   we estimated the expected term by considering various factors including the vesting period of options granted  employees historical exercise and post employment termination behavior and aggregation by homogeneous employee groups 
our estimated volatility was derived using our historical stock price volatility 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends 
the risk free interest rate is based upon us treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the share based awards 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues the following table summarizes our revenues for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  year ended december  difference difference product sales license fee and royalty income sponsored research contracts and grants total product sales revenue is primarily generated from the sales of advanced diagnostic instruments and various diagnostic products 
the increase in product sales revenue in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in is due primarily to the acquisitions of spectral s and amplimedical s product lines on february  and may   respectively 
sales revenue grew in as compared to due primarily to the acquisition of epoch s product lines in december 
table of contents the future due to the acquisition of spectral s and amplimedical s product lines we expect revenue to continue to increase in as compared to when we record a full year of sales revenue for these product lines 
in addition to this acquired revenue  we expect increases in revenue from our advance diagnostic instruments and our internally developed diagnostic products 
however  this maybe impacted by the us fda requiring regulatory clearance for certain of our reagents 
we do not expect any significant revenue from our initial plasma based nt probnp congestive heart failure test  that received a k clearance from the fda in the whole blood congestive heart failure test  which remains in development  will significantly expand the potential market and revenue generating capability of the product if cleared with the fda 
license fee and royalty revenue is generated by licensing our intellectual property rights to third parties 
in the years ended december  and the majority of our license fee and royalty revenue was related to our royalty minimums under a licensing agreement with applied biosystems inc applied biosystems for the taqman nuclease real time pcr 
the increase in license fees and royalty revenue in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was due to renegotiating our licensing agreement with applied biosystems to increase our minimum royalties 
license fees and royalty income increased in as compared to due to recognizing a full year of royalty revenue after acquiring the applied biosystems licensing agreement in the december acquisition of epoch 
the future after december   future royalties from applied biosystems will be based on actual sales 
from our review of the sales trends of products under this license agreement  we expect that future royalty revenue will remain at similar levels as seen in  however  license revenue under the same agreement ended and therefore the overall revenue stream from applied biosystems is expected to decrease in on september   we entered into an agreement with drug royalty trust drt where we assigned the rights associated with this royalty agreement from july through december to drt for a million upfront payment in cash 
going forward we will not receive any cash from this license agreement until unless actual sales exceed certain annually agreed upon thresholds 
we recognized this payment as assigned royalty interests obligation and will continue to recognize revenue quarterly based on actual royalties under the applied biosystems agreement 
we will amortize the assigned royalty interests under the drt agreement quarterly through december although we expect our relationship with applied biosystems to continue for the foreseeable future  this contract may be terminated by applied biosystems with a day notice 
in addition  with our growing intellectual property profile of us patents and with our relationship with jurilab  ltd  we are continuing to evaluate royalty and licensing opportunities and we may choose to license other intellectual property in the future  if we believe the terms and conditions are acceptable 
sponsored research revenue is nonrefundable money generated through the development agreement with hitachi 
the decrease in sponsored research revenue directly relates to the termination of the hitachi collaborative research agreement in august funding through this agreement was completed in the second quarter of the future with the termination of our sponsored research agreement with hitachi completed in the second quarter of we do not expect any revenue from hitachi in the future 
contracts and grants revenue is nonrefundable payments by various federal  state and private agencies for our research and development efforts awarded through contracts and grants 
contracts and grants revenue is recorded as the costs and expenses to perform the research are incurred  if the amount is reasonably commensurate with the effort expended and collection of the payment is reasonably assured 
under certain arrangements where funding is provided contractually on a scheduled basis  revenue is recorded ratably over the term of the arrangement 
payments received in advance under these arrangements are recorded as deferred revenue until the expenses are incurred 
the increase in contract and grant revenue in as compared to was primarily related to additional revenue generated 
table of contents from a research and development agreements we entered into with a private entity in july and a full year of receiving the bill and melinda gate foundation grant 
the decrease in contract and grant revenue in as compared to primarily related to revenue generated in from a bill and melinda gates foundation grant and two new nih grants not offsetting the winding down of several contracts entered into in previous years 
the future the recognition of revenue under contracts and grants may vary from quarter to quarter and may result in significant fluctuations in operating results from year to year depending on the timing and quantity of agreements and contracts 
on december  we announced we were awarded a million contract from the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc 
the current award is for the first two phases of a five phase development project 
if we are awarded all five phases  the award may total approximately million over the next two to three years 
cost and expenses cost of product sales in thousands year ended december  year ended december  difference difference cost of product sales cost of product sales relates to the expenses associated with manufacturing our products 
these expenses include the materials  labor  and various overhead costs required to build our products 
included in our overhead expenses are charges for excess capacity 
in  and the cost of product sales related to the cost of manufacturing of advanced diagnostic instruments the second generation molecular testing platforms and various diagnostic products real time pcr products and asr test suites 
the increase in the cost of product sales in as compared to the same period in primarily related to increased product sales arising from the acquisition of the spectral and amplimedical product line related manufacturing costs with no comparable expenses in the spectral and amplimedical product lines accounted for million and million  respectively  of the increase in the cost of product sales as compared to the same periods in in addition  following the commercial launch of the second generation molecular testing platform  in late  we incurred additional overhead charges related to the conversion of a significant portion of our product development facilities to a manufacturing and assembly facility 
this was reflected in approximately million in excess capacity charges in as compared to when these overhead charges were expensed into research and development 
the decrease in cost of product sales in as compared to related to a million inventory reserve expense in without this inventory reserve expense the cost of product sales would have increased in as compared to this increase related to incurring a full year of manufacturing cost for real time asrs that were acquired in our december epoch acquisition 
as of december   and we had inventory reserves of million  million and million  respectively  that primarily related to our first generation molecular testing system  the molecular biology workstation 
this inventory reserve was accumulated throughout and in  we did not sell any inventory out of this reserve  however  in december we determined that the reserve as originally recorded exceeded the carrying value of the related inventory 
as a result  we reversed the reserve related to our first generation instrument by approximately million  we also determined that we were under reserved on our point of care inventory and took an additional charge of approximately million 
the net of these two items was a million reserve reduction that lowered cost of goods sold during the fourth quarter of in  we sold approximately  of first generation molecular testing systems that had been fully reserved 
the future 
in we expect our cost of product sales to increase as compared to as we include a full year of spectral s and amplimedical s product sales and related manufacturing costs 
we also expect to 
table of contents continue to incur excess production capacity within our manufacturing facilities while we work to build demand for our advanced diagnostic instruments and various diagnostic products 
in addition  our second generation molecular testing system has a lower selling price per unit  therefore  our gross margins depend on the number of units sold or rented and the number of higher margin test kits we are able to sell to absorb our fixed overhead costs 
research and development expenses in thousands year ended december  year ended december  difference difference research and development research and development relates to the expenses associated with our efforts to develop advance molecular diagnostics products for commercialization and the expenses incurred while conducting reimbursable research and development under contractual agreements with various federal  state and private entities 
the increase in research and development costs in as compared to the same period in related to  in additional research and development activities acquired after our acquisition of spectral and amplimedical  million in additional research activities related to consolidating our minority interest in jurilab for a full year in  and million in non cash stock base compensation expenses with no comparable expenses in the increase in as compared to primarily related to our decision to continue to fund on going research and development projects at synx and epoch that were acquired in april and december  respectively 
in addition  we incurred approximately million of research and development costs associated with the september investment and subsequent consolidation of jurilab ltd a variable interest entity 
the future 
as a part of our continual focus on narrowing our losses and working towards positive cash flows from operations  we plan to reduce costs in research and development expenditures that are not funded by contracts or grants 
selling  general and administrative expenses in thousands year ended december  year ended december  difference difference selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses relates to the costs associated with promoting and selling our products and the administrative costs required to support our operations 
the increase in expenses in as compared to included an additional million for the on going operational costs associated with spectral and amplimedical and million in non cash stock based compensation with no comparable charges in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as compared to primarily related to million in additional expenses due to incurring a full year of synx and epoch s selling and administrative costs 
in addition  we incurred an additional million for selling and marketing expenses as compared to that was primarily related to the release of our second generation molecular testing system and the anticipated release of several new products 
the future 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenditures on a percentage basis will trend lower than the increases in our revenue 
on a consolidated basis  we expect to achieve significant synergies and savings by consolidating many of the general and administrative functions 
the savings from consolidation of general and administrative activities are expected to be offset by increased sales and marketing expenses required to support our larger number product lines 
expenses may also be further impacted by potential future business combinations or corporate development transactions 

table of contents charges for goodwill  acquired in process research and development impairment for acquired technology in thousands year ended december  year ended december  difference difference impairment charge on goodwill charge for acquired in process research and development amortization of purchased intangible assets goodwill is created using the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions and it represents the difference between the acquisition price and the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets 
in  we recognized million and million in goodwill assets related to our purchases of epoch and synx  respectively 
in  using the prescribed methodology of sfas  we determined that the fair value of the reporting unit related to epoch was approximately million 
therefore  we incurred a non cash impairment charge to our goodwill of million 
in  we recognized million and million in goodwill assets related to our purchases of spectral and amplimedical  respectively 
the future 
annually  we assess potential impairments to goodwill when there is evidence that events or circumstances indicate that the recorded value of an asset the carrying amount may not be recovered 
these assessments are based on estimates of the materiality of various on going events and circumstances related to the goodwill asset 
indicators of impairment maybe the assets inability to meet prior revenue estimates  inconsistent operational performance  lack of future potential  or other factors 
as of december  we believe we have recorded the fair value of our goodwill on our balance sheet 
however  it is difficult to model all possible future events and if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our remaining goodwill 
we incurred a non cash charge of million related to the expensing of acquired in process research and development ipr d  related to the synx acquisition in the ipr d asset was expensed at the date of acquisition in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
the estimated fair value of million in ipr d expense was related to million for congestive heart failure chf   for traumatic brain injury tbi and  for diabetes diagnostic products 
these products as of the acquisition date in april  had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
the future 
the development of these diagnostic products is subject to a number of risks  including development  regulatory and marketing risks 
as of december  none of these products has been commercialized  however  our chf product is closest to commercialization 
we do not currently have a schedule for the commercialization of the tbi or diabetes diagnostic products 
the primary risk associated with not completing this technology  as anticipated  is the delay in recovery or non recovery of our investment in this area of research and development 
we do not expect to incur any additional charges for acquired ipr d related to the synx or epoch acquisitions 
however  if we acquire other companies in the future  we may incur additional material ipr d expenses 
additional costs associated with the completion of ipr d projects are recorded as research and development expenses in the period incurred 
amortization of purchased intangibles is our effort to match the benefits of the intellectual property we have acquired with current period expenses 
the increase in the amortization of purchased intangible assets in compared to related to the amortization of million in acquired identifiable intangible assets when we purchased spectral s and amplimedical s assets in the increase in as compared related to the amortization of million in acquired technology intangible assets when we purchase epoch in december 
table of contents the future 
we expect amortization expense to remain consistent at its current level for the remainder of the year 
however  amortization expense may also be impacted by potential future business combinations or our periodic impairment evaluations 
other income the following table summarizes our other income for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  year ended december  difference difference interest income interest expense other expense warrant valuation adjustment provision for income tax gain loss on sale of investments gain loss on foreign currency total other income interest income interest income relates to the interest we receive on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
our interest income is primarily influenced by the average balances held in our cash  cash equivalent and short term investment accounts 
an additional  less significant  factor causing fluctuations in our interest income is the interest rate yield  which has trended up in the periods presented 
interest expense interest expense increased in as compared to primarily due to us assigning certain rights associated with a royalty agreement with applied biosystems to drt through for a million upfront payment in cash 
we guaranteed drt a minimum of million in royalty revenue through using an implied interest rate of we incurred approximately  in interest expense with no comparable expenses in in addition  we recorded revenues from applied biosystems in excess of our minimum obligations due to drt 
the increased revenue from applied biosystems has been assigned to drt  and as a result  we incurred an additional  in interest expense payable to drt 
in and  interest expense primarily related to long term obligations secured by our property and equipment 
warrant valuation adjustment as a result of our december acquisition of epoch  we assumed warrants for  shares of our common stock 
the warrants have an exercise price of per share and expire in early if there is a change of control of nanogen  under certain circumstances the warrants have a provision that allows them to be redeemed for cash based on the black sholes formula 
however  the volatility variable in the black sholes formula is limited to the lesser of or our actual historical volatility 
using the methodology prescribed in eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in a company s own stock  we recorded a current liability for the fair value of the cash redemption portion of the warrants 
the liability was measured and recorded in accordance with the terms of the warrant agreements 
the valuation of the warrants and the corresponding liability are re measured quarterly until the warrants are exercised or expire 

table of contents the decrease in the market price of our common stock and other changes in the black scholes formula s variables from december  to december  resulted in a  decrease in the value of the warrants 
therefore  we reported  as a warrant valuation adjustment in our statement of operations for the year ended december  the decrease in the market price of our common stock and other changes in the black scholes formula s variables from december  to december  resulted in a million decrease in the value of the warrants 
therefore  we reported million as a warrant valuation adjustment in our statement of operations for the year ended december  provision for income tax we recorded a provision for income tax in due to foreign taxes related to our may  acquisition of amplimedical 
gain on foreign currency in  the gain of  in foreign currency transactions primarily related to our may  acquisition of amplimedical s italian assets and operations where we were required to hold certain euro based investments as security for acquisition related payables 
we recorded a gain as the value of the euro based investments rose against the dollar 
in  we recognized million of previously unrealized foreign currency translation gains 
this related to our decision to discontinue all material business activities of nanogen recognomics gmbh in liquidity and capital resources at december  we have cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  available for sale of approximately million 
we expect that our existing capital resources  anticipated product revenues  license fees and contract and grant funding will be sufficient to support our planned operations  at least through the next twelve months 
as we continue to consume cash and have quarterly net losses  we are required to make significant assumptions about our operating cash requirements and our ability to continue to raise capital to finance our on going operations 
we assume that we will have the ability to sell a sufficient amount of securities to investors to continue our strategy of expanding our product pipeline by acquiring companies or assets and supporting our on going internal product development 
without access to this financing  on terms acceptable to us  we may have to curtail or cease operations and product development that will materially alter our current business strategy

table of contents short term and long term liquidity the following is a summary of our key liquidity measures as of december   and in thousands december  december  december  total cash and cash equivalents and short term investment  available for sale working capital our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  available for sale and working capital has continued to decrease each year since december  this is primarily a result of cash receipts from revenues  capital financing  and the assignment of royalty rights not offsetting the cash used in our on going research and business development efforts 
in addition  we have been using cash to support the businesses we have acquired in and going forward  we believe we can use less cash as we focus on cutting costs and work to increase sales revenue from our various product lines 
going forward  due to our negative cash flows from operations we expect to remain dependent on equity financing or other sources of non dilutive financing 
historic sources of finances from inception to december   we have financed our operations primarily by issuing our stock and warrants generating revenues assignment of certain royalty interests to drt financing our trade receivables obtained cash through our acquisition of epoch using proceeds from our litigation settlement with combimatrix obtaining a modest amount of capital equipment long term financing reimbursement from federal  state and private agencies for certain research and development projects financing activities in  and due to our negative cash flows from operations we remained dependent on equity financing or other sources of non dilutive financing to fund our operations 
significant equity financing activities in   and included we filed a shelf registration statement in june with the us securities and exchange commission sec that allowed us to raise up to million in equity financing transactions 
on may   we filed a b registration statement with the sec to increase our available funding under this shelf registration statement as of may  by approximately million

in addition  we received approximately million for issuing million common stock shares related to the exercise of warrants that were issued in a private placement 
in  and we issued approximately   and million shares of common stock to our employees under stock options plans and received in net proceeds approximately   and million  respectively 
significant non dilutive financing activities in  and included in  we entered into an agreement where we assigned certain rights associated with a royalty agreement from july through december for a million upfront payment in cash 
in  we obtained a million loan under our million revolving working capital debt facility  secured by our italian accounts receivables 
in we entered into an equipment funding agreement for up to approximately million through december  in march  we extended our million december equipment funding agreement to provide financing for equipment purchases through march in  and we received approximately   and  respectively  under these equipment funding agreements 
under these equipment funding agreements  in  and we used approximately  million and  respectively  to pay down the debt associated with these equipment funding obligations 
in  under our development agreement with hitachi we received  in funding 
operating activities the material driver of our on going negative cash flows from operating activities is the result of our sales revenues not offsetting our business expenditures 
the increase in cash used in operating activities in as compared to primarily related to additional on going operational costs after our acquisitions of spectral and amplimedical  as well as the additional impact on working capital for the increase in accounts receivable at amplimedical due to its long collection times 
the collection cycle at amplimedical is considered normal in the italian healthcare market where the majority of the sales have taken place 
the increase in cash used in operating activities in as compared to primarily related to incurring a full year of additional on going operational activities after our acquisition of epoch and synx 

table of contents investing activities in  and to increase the rate of return on excess cash balances  we invested excess cash received from our financing activities into highly liquid short term investments 
in and  cash provided by investing activities was primarily the result of using cash from the sale and maturity of these short term investments to fund on going operations 
cash provided by investing activities decreased in as compared to primarily due to the use of approximately million in cash related to the purchase of spectral s and amplimedical s assets 
in  we used cash in investing activities to make a series of strategic investments into jurilab  fastraq and pgx and to pay outstanding liabilities associated with the december acquisition of epoch 
in  the cash used in investing activities was a result of us purchasing short term investments with the excess cash generated from our financing activities and issuing million shares of common stock to acquire synx and epoch where we received million in cash  net of the associated acquisition expenses 
capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities 
therefore  in  and we used cash to purchase million  million and  in property and equipment to support the development of our product lines 
the increases in spending in property equipment purchased in  and is a result of us purchasing additional property and equipment to support the on going selling and development efforts of the businesses we acquired in and we have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in s k a ii 
at december   our outstanding contractual obligations included in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations other commitments total less than year years years thereafter debt obligations a other long term liabilities b operating leases purchase commitments c acquisition payable d commitments to fund research and development e assignment of royalty interests f total contractual obligations other commitments a we have recorded in our balance sheets debt related to the consolidation of jurilab  a material vie  of which we are the primary beneficiary 
the liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating the vie do not represent additional claims on our general assets  rather  they represent claims against the specific assets of the consolidated vie 
therefore  we have only included debt obligations that represent claims on our general assets 
b in july  we executed a ten year agreement with hitachi to develop  manufacture and distribute potential products based on the parties proprietary technologies 
at a minimum  we were required to match the hitachi contribution to our research and development on an annual basis over a ten year period 
in addition  we are required to repay of hitachi s contributions to research and development with no interest over an indefinite period of time 
from the inception of the collaboration agreement with hitachi through the termination of the agreement in august  we received a total of million in sponsored research funding 
half of this funding was recorded as revenue and the remaining half is recorded as a long term liability 
we recognized the last  in revenue from hitachi in and do not expect any 
table of contents revenue from this agreement in the future 
at december  we owe approximately million to hitachi and the repayment amount is determined as of our gross molecular testing system cartridge sales 
c our manufacturing agreement with hitachi  ltd 
hitachi requires that we provide annual purchase commitments to hitachi for our next generation nanochip workstations  the nanochip as of december   we had commitments to purchase approximately million of nanochip workstations through december future purchase commitments will be determined based on product demand and inventory levels 
d represents the remaining estimated payment to be made related to the purchase of amplimedical 
this amount is fully secured by a letter of credit and will therefore be settled through the letter of credit without impacting the cash  cash equivalent  or short term investments held at december  e we have entered into various development agreements for the development of a certain future products 
actual funding of the commitments included in the table above are subject to performance by our development partners and their ability to meet certain milestones 
the million commitment above assumes that all milestones and payments are achieved 
f in september  we entered into an agreement to assign certain rights associated with our applied biosystems  inc royalty agreement from the period of july through december to drt for an upfront payment of million 
under the agreement  we have guaranteed minimum royalty payments from applied biosystems to drt 
if the royalty payments fall below certain minimums in a given fiscal year  we are required to pay cash to drt for the difference between the actual royalty payments from applied biosystems and the minimums 
in addition  if royalty payments from applied biosystems are above certain thresholds for a given calendar year we will receive  in cash  a certain percentage of the amount above the threshold 
we are a party to development site agreements with various entities where we may be obligated to pay license fees or royalties for any customer owned or licensed intellectual property used to develop any of our commercial products 
none of these agreements individually are considered material 
future accounting requirements in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation number  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin requires that we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin are effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas no 
is effective for us beginning january  we are evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had federal  state and foreign net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards of approximately million  million and million  respectively  and million and million of research and development  tax credits available to offset future federal and state income taxes  respectively 
the federal and state nol carryforwards are subject to alternative minimum tax limitations and to examination by 
table of contents the tax authorities 
the federal tax loss carryforwards will continue expiring in  unless utilized  and the state tax loss carryforwards will continue expiring in  unless utilized 
the federal and state r d tax credit carryforwards will continue expiring in unless utilized 
pursuant to sections and of the internal revenue code  annual use of the our net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be limited due to cumulative changes in ownership of more than over a year period 
we may be subject to similar limitations on our canadian losses acquired from synx 
we have not performed a formal analysis to quantify the amount of possible limitations 
currently the net operating losses reflected above have not been reduced by potential limitations  however  a full valuation allowance has been placed on all deferred tax assets and  therefore  there is no material impact on our financial statements 
similar limitations may also apply to utilization of r d tax credits to offset taxes payable 
however  we do not believe such limitations may have a material impact on our ability to utilize the nols 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates relates primarily to short term investments 
these short term investments  reported at an aggregate fair market value of million as of december   consist primarily of investments in debt instruments of financial institutions and corporations with strong credit ratings and united states government obligations 
these securities are subject to market rate risk inasmuch as their fair value will fall if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points from the levels prevailing at december   for example  the fair value of the portfolio would not decline by a material amount 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risk inherent in these securities 
however  we do attempt to reduce such risks by generally limiting the maturity date of such securities  diversifying our investments and limiting the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
while we do not always have the intent  we do currently have the ability to hold these investments until maturity and  therefore  believe that reductions in the value of such securities attributable to short term fluctuations in interest rates would not materially affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
changes in interest rates would affect the interest income we earn on our cash balances after re investment 
foreign currency exchange rate exposure the functional currency for our canadian and netherlands subsidiaries is the us dollar 
the functional currency of our majority owned subsidiaries in italy is the euro 
the italian subsidiaries accounts are translated from the euro to the us dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date for balance sheet accounts  and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenues and expense accounts 
the effects of translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements included herein 
in certain instances  our subsidiaries conduct business with customers and vendors in euros or in other local european currencies 
exchange gains and losses arising from these transactions are recorded using the actual exchange rate differences on the date of the transaction 
we have not taken any action to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  such as options or futures contracts  with respect to transactions with our european customers and vendors 
the net tangible assets of our foreign subsidiaries  excluding intercompany balances  was approximately million at december  notwithstanding the foregoing  the indirect effect of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 
for example currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect international demand for our products 
in addition  interest rates fluctuations may affect our customers buying patterns 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations may broadly influence the united states and foreign economies resulting in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations
