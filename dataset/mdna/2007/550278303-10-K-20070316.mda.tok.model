item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to those statements included in item of this form k 
this discussion may contain certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements are those that are not historical in nature 
see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth under risk factors in item a of this on form k and elsewhere in this form k  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in such forward looking statements 
overview executive summary our primary mission is to provide a secure stream of income for our stockholders based on the steady and reliable payments of residential mortgages 
we began investing in  with a spread strategy of investing in high quality  adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities and levering these investments primarily through repurchase agreements 
while this strategy has a minimal level of credit risk  it also has considerable interest rate risk 
the persistently flat yield curve and ongoing federal reserve board rate increases since june pressured our ability to provide steady income  and led us to augment our strategy in since  we include investments in non agency mortgage backed securities rated below aaa as well as prime whole loan purchases and securitizations of those loans 
this diversified strategy has reduced our interest rate risk and built the basis for our dividend stability and growth 
during  we completed repositioning our portfolios in order to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility such that our residential mortgage credit portfolio now represents the majority of our overall asset portfolio with investments that are less sensitive to interest rates  and therefore more predictable and sustainable 
as a further result of this repositioning  approximately of the securities in our spread portfolio now consists of residential mortgage backed securities with interest rates that reset within one month or less and the balance reset within one year 
our credit strategy seeks to structure  acquire and fund mortgage loans that will provide long term reliable income to our stockholders 
we seek to accomplish this goal primarily through the purchase of mortgage loans that we design and originate through selected high quality providers with whom we have long and well established relationships 
we then securitize those loans and seek to retain the most valuable tranches of the securitizations 
these securitizations reduce our sensitivity to interest rates and help match the income we earn on our mortgage assets with the cost of our related liabilities 
the debt that we incur in these securitizations is non recourse to us  however  our mortgage loans are pledged as collateral for the securities we issue 
as a secondary strategy  we invest in subordinated mortgage backed securities that have credit ratings below aaa 
we do this opportunistically  as we discover value and credit arbitrage opportunities in the market 
using these investment strategies  we seek to acquire mortgage related assets  finance these purchases in the capital markets and use leverage in order to provide an attractive return on stockholders equity 
we have acquired and may seek to acquire additional assets that we expect will produce competitive returns  taking into consideration the amount and nature of the anticipated returns from the investments  our ability to pledge the investments for secured  collateralized borrowings and the costs associated with financing  managing  securitizing and reserving for these investments 
recently  the subprime mortgage banking environment has been experiencing considerable strain from rising delinquencies and liquidity pressures and several subprime mortgage lenders have failed 
the increased scrutiny of the subprime lending market is one of the factors that have impacted general market conditions as well as perceptions of our business 
investors should distinguish our business model from that of a subprime originator 
we do not acquire subprime mortgage loans 
we are not a direct originator of mortgage loans and therefore we are not subject to early payment default claims 
we acquire mortgage loans exclusively from well capitalized originators  who 
table of contents meet our standards for financial and operational quality 
we maintain ample liquidity to manage our business and have largely match funded our balance sheet 
during the last year  we have substantially reduced our reliance on short term repurchase agreement funding 
as such  we experienced no liquidity strains during the recent market turmoil 
we invest in high quality residential mortgage loans  aaa rated and agency backed mortgage backed securities and subordinated mortgage backed securities which have significant structural credit enhancement 
at december   of our assets consisted of first lien  prime quality residential mortgage loans  with a weighted average fico score of and a weighted average loan to value ratio  net of mortgage insurance  of 
our aaa rated and agency backed mortgage backed securities portfolio represented of our assets at december  this portfolio has virtually no credit risk 
our subordinated mortgage backed securities portfolio represented of our assets at december  and had a weighted average credit rating of bbb 
structured credit enhancements in this portfolio provide us with significant protection against credit loss 
our diversified business model provides us flexibility to allocate capital to our various investment strategies as market conditions change 
we neither directly originate mortgage loans nor directly service mortgage loans 
we purchase pools of mortgage loans through our diverse network of well capitalized origination partners 
all of the loans we purchase are underwritten to agreed upon specifications in partnership with our selected high quality originators 
in addition  we obtain representations and warranties from each originator to the effect that each loan is underwritten in accordance with the guidelines 
an originator who breaches its representations and warranties may be obligated to repurchase loans from us 
within the loan market  we have focused on prime quality  first lien alt a adjustable rate mortgage loans 
in the alt a market  borrowers choose the convenience of less than full documentation in exchange for a slightly higher mortgage rate 
we diligently review the credit risk associated with each mortgage loan pool we purchase 
we employ a comprehensive underwriting process  driven by our highly experienced personnel 
we require mortgage insurance on all loans with loan to value ratios in excess of and  in certain pools  we purchase supplemental mortgage insurance down to the loan to value ratio level 
our mortgage loan portfolio has virtually no exposure to the subprime sector which is currently generating high delinquencies 
at december   mortgage loans with fico scores less than  a measure which is generally considered to be an indicator of subprime  represented just of our total mortgage loan portfolio 
in addition  at december   none of our mortgage loans had loan to value ratios  net of mortgage insurance  greater than 
no documentation loans as a percentage of our total loan portfolio was just at december  we believe that our collateral characteristics  as well as our comprehensive underwriting process  provide us with strong protection against credit loss 
the number of seriously delinquent loans in our loan portfolio was just basis points of total loans at december  this is well within our expectations for performance and compares very favorably with industry statistics for prime arm loans  for which the mortgage banker s association reports a serious delinquency rate of basis points as of september  our credit performance bears no resemblance to subprime performance  for which the mortgage banker s association reports a serious delinquency rate of basis points as of september  we evaluate our mortgage loan portfolio for impairment on a quarterly basis  and increase or decrease our allowance for loan losses based on that analysis 
our allowance for loan losses was million at december  when foreclosures occur  we believe we will realize modest severities  due to the low weighted average loan to value ratios in our portfolio  and to current indications from our ongoing surveillance of property valuations on delinquent loans 
we finance our portfolios of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities through the use of repurchase agreements  securitization transactions structured as secured financings  a commercial paper facility  warehouse lending facilities and junior subordinated notes 
we manage the levels of the financing liabilities funding our portfolios based on recourse leverage 
at december   our recourse leverage ratio  defined as recourse financing liabilities as a ratio of stockholders equity plus long term debt  was x 
we generally seek to maintain an overall borrowing recourse leverage of less than times the amount of our equity and long term debt 
we actively manage our capital efficiency through the types of borrowings  including the non 
table of contents recourse mortgage backed notes issued to finance our securitized mortgage loans  in order to manage our liquidity and interest rate related risks 
we manage liquidity to ensure that we have the continuing ability to maintain cash flows that are adequate to fund operations and meet commitments on a timely and cost effective basis 
at december   we had unencumbered assets of over million  consisting of unpledged mortgage backed securities  equity securities  and cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that our liquidity level is in excess of that necessary to satisfy our operating requirements and we expect to continue to use diverse funding sources to maintain our financial flexibility 
in september  we entered into a warehouse agreement with greenwich capital financial products  inc  whereby it will finance the purchase of up to million in asset backed securities 
the facility is intended to be used to purchase mortgage backed securities rated below aaa and we intend to finance the securities permanently through collateralized debt obligations  or cdos 
cdo transactions will allow us to achieve our objective of matching the income we earn on our assets  plus the benefit of hedging activities  to our cost of liabilities 
we anticipate issuing our first cdo in the first half of for the purpose of prospectively financing our credit sensitive portfolio on a match funded basis 
this financing will be non recourse to us and more capital efficient than traditional repurchase agreement financing 
we also intend to issue a second cdo later in our business is affected by the following economic and industry factors that may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations interest rate trends and changes in the yield curve  the availability of a sufficient supply of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities for purchase that meet our standards  rates of prepayment on our mortgage loans and the mortgages underlying our mortgage backed securities  continued creditworthiness of the holders of mortgages underlying our mortgage related assets  highly competitive markets for investment opportunities  and other market developments 
in addition  several factors relating to our business may also impact our financial condition and results of operations 
these factors include credit risk as defined by prepayments  delinquencies and defaults on our mortgage loans and the mortgage loans underlying our mortgage backed securities  overall leverage of our portfolio  access to funding and adequate borrowing capacity  negative amortization  increases in our borrowing costs  the ability to use derivatives to mitigate our interest rate and prepayment risks  the market value of our investments  and compliance with reit requirements and the requirements we must meet to qualify for an exemption under the investment company act of refer to risk factors in item a of this form k for additional discussion regarding these and other risk factors that affect our business

table of contents summary and outlook for the year ended december   our net income was million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or loss per share  for the year ended december  reit taxable net income was million  or per share  and million  or per share  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
reit taxable net income is the basis upon which we determine our dividends to stockholders 
the difference between net income and reit taxable net income primarily relates to interest income and interest expense on our remic securitizations  impairment losses on mortgage backed securities  provisions for loan losses  loan servicing expense and gains and losses on derivative instruments 
effective january   we discontinued the use of hedge accounting as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted 
as a result  beginning in the first quarter of  all changes in the value of our portfolio of hedges  including interest rate swaps and eurodollar futures contracts  are now reflected in our consolidated statement of operations rather than primarily through accumulated other comprehensive income and loss on our consolidated balance sheet 
this change has introduced some volatility to our results of operations  as the market value of the hedge positions changes 
we declared million of dividends in  or per share 
we declared million of dividends in  or per share 
our book value at december  was million  or per share 
on october   we issued million shares of our common stock at per share as a result of completing a public offering issued pursuant to our shelf registration statement on form s that was declared effective by the sec on january  at december   the composition of our billion in mortgage assets was as follows in prime quality securitized whole loans  in aaa rated and agency backed short duration hybrid and arm securities and in credit sensitive securities with a weighted average credit rating of bbb 
during  we actively pursued our business diversification into prime quality residential mortgage credit 
this diversification included sales of interest rate sensitive mortgage backed securities from our spread portfolio of billion  purchases of prime quality residential mortgage loans of billion and subsequent completion of seven loan securitizations totaling billion and purchases of mortgage backed securities with ratings below aaa of billion 
we also purchased billion of floating rate aaa rated mortgage backed securities during we expect our credit quality to remain high as we prudently invest in residential mortgage credit risk 
in our loan purchases  we are underwriting on a loan by loan basis 
generally  our target average fico score is the midway point in our stratification around this level generally ranges between and we require mortgage insurance on loans with loan to value ratios of or higher 
in certain pools  we purchase mortgage insurance on loans with loan to value ratios between and 
we focus on single family  owner occupied residences with adequate valuation protection  typically in the loan to value range 
we carefully assess collateral valuation and review every loan with automated valuation screens 
our target borrower has demonstrated an ability to handle credit and carries a manageable amount of overall debt versus income 
our target loan size is well below the super jumbo level  and ranges in the to thousand range 
we also diversify our geographic exposure 
our multi factor risk analysis concentrates on layered risk  which is the conjunction of two or more risk factors in a loan 
for example  we may underwrite a very high fico borrower in a high ltv situation  whereas we may reject that same loan if the high ltv is accompanied by recent history of multiple refinancings on the same property 
in other words  no single variable defines our loan underwriting decision making process 
we take a comprehensive view of each loan and underwrite on that basis 
we accept only those loans that meet our careful underwriting criteria 
once we own a loan  our surveillance process includes ongoing analysis through our proprietary data warehouse and servicer files 
we are proactive in our analysis of payment behavior and in loss mitigation through our servicing relationships 

table of contents our target market is the alt a adjustable rate loan 
alt a is one of the fastest growing segments of the mortgage market 
we believe that a majority of the prime loans made in were made in the alt a form 
in the alt a market  borrowers choose the convenience of less than full documentation in exchange for a slightly higher mortgage rate 
at december   the weighted average coupon of our total mortgage assets was 
as a result of the sale of assets from our spread portfolio and the redeployment of our capital into the higher yielding assets in our residential mortgage credit portfolio  the net interest spread on our investment portfolio has increased to for the year ended december  compared to from for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to reducing our investment in interest rate sensitive mortgage assets and increasing our investment in mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities which are match funded with permanent financing in the form of mortgage backed notes 
see additional information on the components of our net interest spread and interest expense at results of operations 
going forward  we will augment our current loan purchase and securitization activities with opportunistic purchases of credit sensitive securities created by others 
we anticipate that most of our credit sensitive portfolio will be permanently financed on a match funded basis with our first cdo  which we expect to complete in the first half of this financing will be non recourse to us and more capital efficient than traditional repurchase agreement financing 
we also intend to issue a second cdo later in our primary sources of capital are mortgage backed notes  repurchase agreements  warehouse lending facilities  commercial paper and junior subordinated notes 
we believe that our current financing and operating cash flow is sufficient to fund our business for the foreseeable future 
we will also consider increasing our capital resources by making additional offerings of equity and debt securities  possibly including classes of preferred stock  common stock  medium term notes  collateralized mortgage obligations and senior or subordinated notes 
such financings will depend on market conditions for capital raises and upon the investment of any net proceeds therefrom 
all debt securities  other borrowings and classes of preferred stock will be senior to our common stock in any liquidation by us 
as a result of these various factors  it is difficult to project when we may seek to raise additional capital

refer to credit risk and interest rate risk in item a of this form k for additional interest rate risk and credit risk discussion 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make some complex and subjective decisions and assessments 
our most critical accounting policies involve decisions and assessments that could significantly affect our reported assets and liabilities  as well as our reported revenues and expenses 
we believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our consolidated financial statements are based were reasonable at the time made based upon information available to us at that time 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
management has identified our most critical accounting policies to be the following classifications of investment securities our investments in mortgage backed securities are classified as available for sale and are carried on our consolidated balance sheets at their fair value 
generally  the classification of securities as available for sale results in changes in fair value being recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income or loss  which is a component of stockholders equity  rather than immediately through earnings 
if our available for sale securities were classified as trading securities  our earnings could experience substantially greater volatility from period to period 

table of contents valuations of mortgage backed securities our spread portfolio of mortgage backed securities has fair values based on estimates provided by independent pricing services and dealers in mortgage backed securities 
because the price estimates may vary between sources  we make certain judgments and assumptions about the appropriate price to use 
different judgments and assumptions could result in different presentations of value 
we estimate the fair value of our residential mortgage credit portfolio of mortgage backed securities using available market information and other appropriate valuation methodologies 
we believe the estimates we use reflect the market values we may be able to receive should we choose to sell the mortgage backed securities 
our estimates involve matters of uncertainty  judgment in interpreting relevant market data and are inherently subjective in nature 
many factors are necessary to estimate market values  including  but not limited to  interest rates  prepayment rates  amount and timing of credit losses  supply and demand  liquidity  cash flows and other market factors 
we apply these factors to our portfolio as appropriate in order to determine market values 
when the fair value of an available for sale security is less than amortized cost  we consider whether there is an other than temporary impairment in the value of the security 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process  requiring the use of judgments and assumptions 
if we determine an other than temporary impairment exists  the cost basis of the security is written down to the then current fair value  and the unrealized loss is recorded as a reduction of current earnings as if the loss had been realized in the period of impairment 
we consider several factors when evaluating securities for an other than temporary impairment  including the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than the amortized cost  whether the security has been downgraded by a rating agency and our continued intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
for the year ended december   we recognized impairment losses of million in connection with our decision to reposition our spread portfolio as we no longer had the intent to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we also recognized impairment losses of million during the year ended december  on mortgage backed securities in our residential mortgage credit portfolio due to other than temporary impairments 
at december   we had gross unrealized losses on our mortgage backed securities classified as available for sale of million which  if not recovered  may result in the recognition of future losses 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is evaluated at least quarterly 
if future evaluations conclude that impairment is other than temporary  we may need to realize a loss that would have an impact on income 
loans held for investment we purchase pools of residential mortgage loans through our network of origination partners 
mortgage loans are designated as held for investment as we have the intent and ability to hold them for the foreseeable future  and until maturity or payoff 
mortgage loans that are considered to be held for investment are carried at their unpaid principal balances  including unamortized premium or discount and allowance for loan losses 
allowance and provision for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level that we believe is adequate based on an evaluation of known and inherent risks related to our loan investments 
when determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  we consider historical and industry loss experience  economic conditions and trends  the estimated fair values of our loans  credit quality trends and other factors that we determine are relevant 
in our review of national and local economic trends and conditions we consider  among other factors  national unemployment data  changes in housing appreciation and whether specific geographic areas where we have 
table of contents significant loan concentrations are experiencing adverse economic conditions and events such as natural disasters that may affect the local economy or property values 
to estimate the allowance for loan losses  we first identify impaired loans 
loans purchased with relatively smaller balances and substantially similar characteristics are evaluated collectively for impairment 
seriously delinquent loans with balances greater than million are evaluated individually 
we consider loans impaired when  based on current information  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  including interest payments 
impaired loans are carried at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or the fair value of the collateral less costs to dispose of the property 
our allowance for loan losses is established using mortgage industry experience and rating agency projections for loans with characteristics which are broadly similar to our portfolio 
this analysis begins with actual day or more delinquencies in our portfolio  and projects ultimate default experience ie  the rate at which loans will go to liquidation on those loans based on mortgage industry loan delinquency migration statistics 
for all loans showing indications of probable default  we apply a severity factor for each loan  again using loss severity projections from a model developed by a major rating agency for loans broadly similar to the loans in our portfolio 
we then use our judgment to ensure all relevant factors that could affect our loss levels are considered and would adjust the allowance for loan losses if we believe that an adjustment is warranted 
over time  as our loan portfolio seasons and generates actual loss experience  we will incorporate our actual loss history for forecasting losses and establishing credit reserves 
we performed an allowance for loan losses analysis as of december  and recorded a million provision for the year ended december  interest income recognition we accrue interest income on our mortgage backed securities based on the coupon rate and the outstanding principal amount of the underlying mortgages 
premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted as adjustments to interest income over the lives of the securities using the effective yield method adjusted for the effects of estimated prepayments based on statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
if our estimate of prepayments is incorrect  we may be required to make an adjustment to the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts that would have an impact on our future results of operations 
certain of the mortgage backed securities in our residential mortgage credit portfolio are accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf   recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
we recognize interest income using the effective yield method 
we use the prospective method for adjusting the level yield used to recognize interest income when estimates of future cash flows over the remaining life of the security either increase or decrease 
cash flows are projected based on management s assumptions for prepayment rates and credit losses using data provided by a third party service provider 
actual economic conditions may produce cash flows that could differ significantly from projected cash flows  and differences could result in an increase or decrease in the yield used to record interest income or could result in impairment losses 
we accrue interest income on our mortgage loans and credit it to income based on the carrying amount and contractual terms or estimated life of the assets using the effective yield method in accordance with sfas no 
we discontinue the accrual of interest on impaired loans when  in management s opinion  the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due 
also  we place loans days or more past due on non accrual status 
when we discontinue an interest accrual  we reverse all associated unpaid accrued interest income against current period operating results 
we recognize interest income subsequently only to the extent cash payments are received 
securitizations we create securitization entities as a means of securing long term  non recourse collateralized financing for our residential mortgage loan portfolio and matching the income earned on residential mortgage 
table of contents loans with the cost of related liabilities  otherwise referred to as match funding our balance sheet 
residential mortgage loans are transferred to a separate bankruptcy remote legal entity from which private label multi class mortgage backed notes are issued 
on a consolidated basis  we account for securitizations as secured financings as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  and  therefore  no gain or loss is recorded in connection with the securitizations 
each securitization entity is evaluated in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation  or fin  r  consolidation of variable interest entities  and we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the securitization entities 
as such  the securitization entities are consolidated into our consolidated balance sheet subsequent to securitization 
residential mortgage loans transferred to securitization entities collateralize the mortgage backed notes issued  and  as a result  those investments are not available to us  our creditors or stockholders 
all discussions relating to securitizations are on a consolidated basis and do not necessarily reflect the separate legal ownership of the loans by the related bankruptcy remote legal entity 
accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities we may enter into a variety of derivative contracts  including futures contracts  swaption contracts  interest rate swap contracts  interest rate cap contracts  as a means of mitigating our interest rate risk on forecasted interest expense as well as to mitigate our credit risk on credit sensitive mortgage backed securities 
effective january   we discontinued the use of hedge accounting  in accordance with sfas no 
all changes in value of derivative contracts that had previously been accounted for under hedge accounting are now recorded in other income or expense and could potentially result in increased volatility in our results of operations 
we may enter into commitments to purchase mortgage loans  or purchase commitments  from our network of originators 
each purchase commitment is evaluated in accordance with sfas no 
to determine whether the purchase commitment meets the definition of a derivative instrument 
purchase commitments that meet the definition of a derivative instrument are recorded at their estimated fair value on the consolidated balance sheet and any change in fair value of the purchase commitment is recognized in other income or expense 
upon settlement of the loan purchase  the purchase commitment derivative is derecognized and is included in the cost basis of the loans purchased 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further discussion about accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
recent accounting pronouncements the fasb has placed an item on its sfas no 
project agenda relating to the treatment of transactions where mortgage backed securities purchased from a particular counterparty are financed via a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty 
currently  we record such assets and the related financing gross on our consolidated balance sheet and the corresponding interest income and interest expense gross on our consolidated statement of operations 
any change in fair value of the security is reported through other comprehensive income under sfas no 
because the security is classified as available for sale 
however  in a transaction where the mortgage backed securities are acquired from and financed under a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty  the acquisition may not qualify as a sale from the seller s perspective under the provisions of sfas no 
in such cases  the seller may be required to continue to consolidate the assets sold to us  based on the seller s continuing involvement with such investments 
depending on the ultimate outcome of the fasb deliberations  we may be precluded from presenting the assets gross on our consolidated balance sheet and instead be required to treat our net investment in such assets as a derivative 
if it is determined that these transactions should be treated as investments in derivatives  the derivative instruments entered into by us in prior years to hedge our interest rate exposure with respect to the borrowings under the associated repurchase agreements may no longer qualify for hedge accounting  and would then  as 
table of contents with the underlying asset transactions  also be marked to market through our consolidated statement of operations 
this potential change in accounting treatment does not affect the economics of the transactions but does affect how the transactions would be reported in our consolidated financial statements 
our cash flows  liquidity and ability to pay a dividend would be unchanged  and we do not believe our reit taxable income or reit status would be affected 
our net equity would not be materially affected 
at december   we did not hold mortgage backed securities purchased from a counterparty and financed via a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty 
at december   we identified available for sale securities with a fair value of million which had been purchased from and financed with the same counterparty 
if we were to change the current accounting treatment for these transactions at december   total assets and total liabilities would each be reduced by approximately million  respectively 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and this statement provides entities with relief from having to separately determine the fair value of an embedded derivative that would otherwise be required to be bifurcated from its host contract in accordance with sfas no 
the statement allows an entity to make an irrevocable election to measure such a hybrid financial instrument at fair value in its entirety  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
the election may be made on an instrument by instrument basis and can be made only when a hybrid financial instrument is initially recognized or when certain events occur that constitute a remeasurement ie  new basis event for a previously recognized hybrid financial instrument 
an entity must document its election to measure a hybrid financial instrument at fair value  either concurrently or via a pre existing policy for automatic election 
once the fair value election has been made  that hybrid financial instrument may not be designated as a hedging instrument pursuant to sfas no 
the statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired  issued or subject to a remeasurement event occurring after the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after september  in january  the fasb released statement implementation issue no

results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  our net income was million  or per fully diluted share  and net loss was million  or loss per share  respectively 
results for the year ended december   include certain non recurring expenses  including one time charges of million  related to the termination of our management agreement with seneca capital management llc  or scm 
in addition  net realized and unrealized gains on derivative instruments of million and net realized and unrealized losses of million were recognized during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the table below details the components of our net interest spread for the years ended december  and for the year ended december  weighted average yield on average earning assets  net of premium amortization or discount accretion weighted average cost of financing liabilities net interest spread weighted average yield on average earning assets  net of premium amortization or discount accretion  is defined as total interest income earned divided by the weighted average amortized cost of our mortgage assets during the period 
weighted average mortgage earning assets during the year ended december  and were billion and billion  respectively 
total interest income from mortgage assets was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the year over year increase in interest income is primarily due to higher yields on our mortgage assets that have resulted from the restructuring and sale of assets in our spread portfolio and the redeployment of our capital into the higher yielding assets of our residential mortgage credit portfolio during  as well as an increase in the overall levels of both mortgage assets and interest rates between december  and december

interest expense consists of interest payments on our debt and consolidated mortgage backed notes issued  less the amortization of mortgage backed securities issuance premiums 
mortgage backed securities issuance premiums are created when interest only securities and other mortgage backed securities are issued at prices greater than their principal value

weighted average financing liabilities during the years ended december  and were billion and billion  respectively 
interest expense for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the increase in interest expense is primarily due to higher rates on our funding liabilities related to the shift to mortgage backed notes from repurchase agreements resulting from the transition from our spread strategy to our residential mortgage credit strategy  as well as an increase in the overall levels of both funding liabilities and interest rates between december  and december

other income for the years ended december  and includes other than temporary impairment losses on mortgage backed securities in our spread portfolio related to certain spread assets that we did not intend to hold until their maturity or their unrealized losses recovered 
operating expenses for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
the year over year increases in operating expenses are primarily due to increased operating expenses that are required to manage our residential mortgage credit strategy as well as increased management compensation and incentive compensation expenses related to the termination of our management agreement with scm 
during the quarter ended september   we completed our transition to full internal management after reaching agreement with scm to terminate the management agreement described below 
because the management agreement has been terminated  we are no longer required to make regular quarterly minimum payments to scm through  nor do we need to accrue future incentive compensation expense for scm 
instead  we paid scm a total of million in cash and accelerated the vesting of  shares of restricted common stock issued to scm 
we paid base management compensation and incentive compensation to scm for the years ended december  and pursuant to a management agreement 
we entered into an amended agreement with scm  dated march   which superseded our original management agreement dated june   and revised the computation of base management compensation and incentive management compensation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further discussion about the management agreement 
base management compensation expense for the year ended december  was million  including the installment payments due to scm related to the termination of the management agreement described above 
base management compensation for the year ended december  was million 
pursuant to the management agreement  base management compensation due to scm was calculated based on 
table of contents a percentage of our average net worth that was managed by scm  and also was subject to a minimum fee 
the amount of assets managed by scm decreased substantially during the first quarter of and further decreased in the second and third quarters of as a result of redeploying assets from the spread portfolio managed by scm into our other portfolios 
consequently  the base management fee calculated pursuant to the average net worth formula was lower than the minimum fee payment due to scm of million for the first and second quarters of as a result  million of the base management compensation expense for the year ended december  represented the minimum fee due to scm 
incentive compensation expense for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the increase in expense is primarily related to the termination of the amended management agreement noted above 
under the amended management agreement  scm did not earn any incentive compensation during the years ended december  and the incentive compensation expense during the years ended december  and related primarily to restricted common stock awards granted for incentive compensation earned in prior periods that vested during the periods 
the incentive compensation expense for the year ended december  also includes the final vesting of all of the restricted stock awards granted to scm earned in prior periods in connection with the termination agreement 
effective september   we will no longer recognize incentive compensation expense related to restricted stock awards granted to scm 
servicing expense  which is a required expense for all of our mortgage loans held for investment  was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in servicing expense year over year is due to the increase in our residential mortgage loan portfolio 
in addition  salaries and benefits were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and reflects the addition of three new employees during the fourth quarter of and new employees during the year ended december  in addition  for year ended december   we recorded a provision for loan losses of million  based on an analysis of our portfolio of loans held for investment at the end of the second  third and fourth quarters of the increase in provision for loan losses year over year is due to the seasoning of our residential mortgage loan portfolio 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  our net loss was million  or loss per share  and our net income of million  or per fully diluted share  respectively

total interest income from mortgage assets was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the year over year increase in interest income is primarily due to the increase in interest income as a result of the implementation of our residential mortgage credit strategy  which includes investments in mortgage backed securities with ratings below aaa and purchases of prime whole loan purchases and securitizations of those loans

the interest expense on junior subordinated notes during is the result of the completion of two trust preferred security offerings 
the net hedge ineffectiveness gains recognized in interest expense during the year ended december  is primarily due to an adjustment to the construction of the hypothetical derivative during the three months ended june  in accordance with our sfas no 
accounting policy which is used to measure hedge ineffectiveness on our eurodollar futures contracts 
we changed the term of our forecasted repurchase agreement liabilities to conform more closely to common industry issuance terms 
as required by sfas no 
 we recognized one time gains of million in the form of hedge ineffectiveness on our eurodollar futures contracts during the three months ended june  the impact of this ineffectiveness was that a portion of the liabilities we had hedged in anticipation of rising interest rates was recognized as gains or offsets to our interest expense in the second quarter of the remaining net hedge ineffectiveness gains for the year ended december  relate to our cash flow hedges

reit taxable net income we calculate reit taxable net income according to the requirements of the code  rather than gaap 
we believe that reit taxable net income is an important measure of our financial performance because reit taxable net income  and not gaap net income  is the basis upon which we make our cash distributions that enable us to maintain our reit status 
we estimate our reit taxable net income at certain times during the course of each fiscal year based upon a variety of information from third parties  although we do not receive some of this information before we complete our estimates 
as a result  our reit taxable net income estimates during the course of each fiscal year are subject to adjustments to reflect not only the subsequent receipt of new information as to future events but also the subsequent receipt of information as to past events 
our reit taxable net income is also subject to changes in the code  or in the interpretation of the code  with respect to our business model 
reit taxable net income for each fiscal year does not become final until we file our tax return for that fiscal year

reit taxable net income entails certain limitations  and by itself it is an incomplete measure of our financial performance over any period

we performed an allowance for loan losses analysis as of december  and recorded a million provision for loan losses for the year ended december   representing basis points 
table of contents of our residential mortgage portfolio 
our allowance for loan losses was established using industry experience and rating agency projections for loans with characteristics which are broadly similar to our portfolio 
this analysis begins with actual day or more delinquencies in our portfolio  and projects ultimate default experience ie  the rate at which loans will go to liquidation on those loans based on industry loan delinquency migration statistics 
for all loans showing indications of probable default  we apply a severity factor for each loan  again using loss severity projections from a model developed by a major rating agency for loans broadly similar to the loans in our portfolio 
management then uses judgment to ensure all relevant factors that could affect our loss levels are considered and would adjust the allowance for loan losses if we believe that an adjustment is warranted 
this analysis was the basis for our million general allocated allowance at december  seriously delinquent loans with balances greater than million are evaluated individually 
such loans are considered impaired when  based on current information  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  including interest payments 
impaired loans are carried at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or the fair value of the collateral less costs to dispose of the property 
we recorded a specific reserve for loans meeting these criteria of million at december  we did not record an unallocated allowance for loan losses at december  as we did not identify any factors in the portfolio which warranted such an allowance 
as of december   nine of the residential loans owned by the company with an outstanding balance of million were considered to be real estate owned  or reo  as a result of foreclosure on delinquent loans

charge offs for the year ended december  of thousand were recorded as a reduction to our allowance for loan losses at the time of foreclosure in accordance with the company s reo policy 
we performed an allowance for loan losses analysis as of december   and we made a determination that no allowance for loan losses was required for our residential mortgage loan portfolio as of december  mortgage backed notes we create securitization entities as a means of securing long term collateralized financing for our residential mortgage loan portfolio  matching the income earned on residential mortgage loans with the cost of related liabilities  otherwise referred to as match funding our balance sheet 
we may use derivative instruments  such as interest rate swaps to achieve this result 
residential mortgage loans are transferred to a separate bankruptcy remote legal entity from which private label multi class mortgage backed securities are issued 
these mortgage backed securities are carried at their unpaid principal balances net of any unamortized discount or premium 
on a consolidated basis  securitizations are accounted for as secured financings as defined by sfas no 
and  therefore  no gain or loss is recorded in connection with the securitizations 
the treatment of securitization transactions can be different for taxation purposes than under gaap 
each securitization entity was evaluated in accordance with fin r  and we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the securitization entities 
as such  the securitization entities are consolidated into our consolidated balance sheet subsequent to securitization 
residential mortgage loans transferred to securitization entities collateralize the mortgage backed securities issued  and  as a result  those investments are not available to us  our creditors or stockholders 
all discussions relating to securitizations are on a consolidated basis and do not necessarily reflect the separate legal ownership of the loans by the related bankruptcy remote legal entity

each series of mortgage backed notes that we issued consisted of various classes of securities that bear interest at varying spreads to the underlying interest rate index

our mortgage assets are typically subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps 
periodic interest rate caps limit the amount by which the interest rate on a mortgage can increase during any given period 
lifetime interest rate caps limit the amount by which an interest rate can increase through the term of a mortgage 
the weighted average lifetime cap of our mortgage backed securities was and at december  and  respectively 
the weighted average lifetime cap of our loans held for investment was and at december  and  respectively 
the periodic adjustments to the interest rates of our mortgage assets are based on changes in an objective index

the principal payment rate attempts to predict the percentage of principal that will paydown over the next months based on historical principal paydowns 
the principal payment rate cannot be considered an indication of future principal repayment rates because actual changes in market interest rates will have a direct impact on the principal prepayments in our portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the primary source of funds for our loan acquisition and securitization portfolio was billion of non recourse mortgage backed notes  with a weighted average borrowing rate of 
in addition  we had a million warehouse lending facility with bear stearns mortgage capital corporation that was established in october  a billion warehouse lending facility with greenwich financial products  inc that was established in january and a billion warehouse lending facility with barclays bank plc that was established in july all three warehouse lending facilities are structured as repurchase agreements 
we also established a million warehouse lending facility with greenwich capital financial products  inc in september to provide financing for our cdo business 
at december   the total outstanding balance on our warehouse lending facilities was million 
there were no outstanding borrowings on our warehouse lending facilities at december  the residential mortgage loans we acquire are initially financed with our warehouse lending facilities  with the intention of ultimately securitizing the loans and financing them permanently through the issuance of non recourse mortgage backed notes 
proceeds from our securitizations are used to pay down the outstanding balance of our warehouse lending facilities 
we match the income that we earn on our mortgage loans  plus the benefit of any hedging activities  with the cost of the liabilities related to our mortgage loans  a process known as match funding our balance sheet 
in order to facilitate the securitization and permanent financing of our mortgage loans  we will generally create subordinated certificates  also provide a specified amount of credit enhancement  which we intend to retain on our balance sheet 
certain mortgage loans that we purchase permit negative amortization 
a negative amortization provision in a mortgage allows the borrower to defer payment of a portion or all of the monthly interest accrued on the mortgage and to add the deferred interest amount to the mortgage s principal balance 
as a result  during periods of negative amortization the principal balances of negatively amortizing mortgages will 
table of contents increase and their weighted average lives will extend 
our mortgage loans generally can experience negative amortization to a maximum amount of of the original mortgage loan balance 
as a result  given the relatively low average loan to value ratio of  net of mortgage insurance  on our portfolio at december   we believe that our portfolio would still have a significant homeowners equity cushion even if all negatively amortizing loans reached their maximum permitted amount of negative amortization 
we have structured all of our negatively amortizing mortgage loans into various securitizations and have retained ownership in these securitizations in part or whole in the form of mortgage backed securities 
these securitization structures effectively prevent the disbursement of deferred interest which arises from negative amortization 
deferred interest increases the bond balances of the securitization structure and is not disbursed from the structure 
securitization structures allocate the principal payments and prepayments on mortgage loans  including loans with negative amortization features 
to date  prepayments on our mortgage loans with negative amortization have been sufficient to offset negative amortization such that all our securitization structures have made all their required payments to bond holders 
a reconciliation of the cash flows on our residential mortgage loans which have negatively amortizing loans and the mortgage backed notes backed by those residential mortgage loans during the year ended december  was as follows dollars in thousands principal payments received on residential mortgage loans principal distributed to mortgage backed note holders principal receipts used for interest payments on mortgage backed notes interest cash receipts on residential mortgage loans for interest and other fee income  net of servicing and other reimbursements interest payments to mortgage backed note holders interest payments on mortgage backed notes in excess of interest cash receipts net cash flow amount includes principal and interest distributed on bonds retained by us 
based on our projections of estimated prepayments on negatively amortizing loans  we believe that our securitizations will continue to support required payments to the holders of the mortgage backed notes issued by us 
the primary source of funds used to finance our mortgage backed securities at december  consisted of repurchase agreements totaling billion with a weighted average current borrowing rate of 
we expect to continue to borrow funds for our mortgage backed securities through repurchase agreements 
at december   we had established borrowing arrangements with various investment banking firms and other lenders  of which were in use on december  increases in short term interest rates could negatively impact the valuation of our mortgage backed securities that we are financing with repurchase agreements  which could limit our future borrowing ability or cause our repurchase agreement counterparties to initiate margin calls 
amounts due upon maturity of our repurchase agreements will be funded primarily through the rollover reissuance of repurchase agreements and monthly principal and interest payments received on our mortgage backed securities 
in august  we established a billion commercial paper facility to finance our purchases of agency and aaa rated mortgage backed securities through a subsidiary we called luminent star funding i 
luminent star funding i is a single seller commercial paper program that provides a financing alternative to repurchase agreement financing by issuing asset backed secured liquidity notes that are rated by the rating agencies standard poor s and moody s 
at december   the outstanding balance on the commercial paper facility was billion at a weighted average borrowing rate of 
in september  we entered into a million term repurchase agreement with barclays capital 
we are using the facility to acquire aaa rated mortgage backed securities 
the facility has a term of up to

we have a margin lending facility with our primary custodian from which we may borrow money in connection with the purchase or sale of securities 
the terms of the borrowings  including the rate of interest payable  are agreed to with the custodian for each amount borrowed 
borrowings are repayable upon demand by the custodian 
no borrowings were outstanding under the margin lending facility at december  at december   we had an outstanding balance against this borrowing facility of million at a rate of 
in  we completed two trust preferred security offerings in the aggregate amount of million  providing long term financing for our balance sheet 
we received proceeds  net of debt issuance costs  from the preferred securities offering in the amount of million 
we manage the levels of the financing liabilities funding our portfolios based on recourse leverage 
at december   our recourse leverage ratio  defined as recourse financing liabilities as a ratio of stockholders equity plus long term debt  was x 
we generally seek to maintain an overall borrowing recourse leverage of less than times the amount of our equity and long term debt 
we actively manage our capital efficiency through our liability structure  including the non recourse mortgage backed notes issued to finance our securitized loans held for investment  in order to manage our liquidity and interest rate related risks 
for liquidity  we also rely on cash flows from operations  primarily monthly principal and interest payments to be received on our mortgage backed securities  as well as any primary securities offerings authorized by our board of directors 
on may   we paid a cash distribution of per share to our stockholders of record on april  on july   we paid a cash distribution of per share to our stockholders of record on june  on november   we paid a cash distribution of per share to our stockholders of record on october  additionally  on november   we paid a special cash dividend of per share  to stockholders of record on october  on january   we paid a cash distribution of per share to our stockholders of record on december  these distributions are taxable dividends and not considered a return of capital 
we did not distribute approximately million of our reit taxable net income for the year ended december  we intend to declare a spillback distribution in this amount in we did not distribute million of our reit taxable net income for the year ended december  we declared a spillback distribution in this amount during the fiscal year 
we believe that equity capital  combined with the cash flows from operations  securitizations and the utilization of borrowings  will be sufficient to enable us to meet anticipated liquidity requirements 
if our cash 
table of contents resources are at any time insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may be required to liquidate mortgage related assets or sell debt or additional equity securities 
if required  the sale of mortgage related assets at prices lower than the carrying value of such assets could result in losses and reduced income

such financings will depend on market conditions for raising capital and for the investment of any net proceeds from such capital raises 
all debt securities  other borrowings and classes of preferred stock will be senior to our common stock in any liquidation of us 

table of contents inflation virtually all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more than inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and our distributions are determined by our board of directors primarily based on our net income as calculated for tax purposes  in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and or fair market value without considering inflation 
contractual obligations and commitments the table below summarizes our contractual obligations at december  the table excludes accrued interest payable  unamortized premium and interest rate swaps because those contracts do not have fixed and determinable payments in millions payments due by period less than more than total year years years years mortgage backed notes repurchase agreements warehouse lending facilities commercial paper junior subordinated notes facilities leases total the mortgage backed notes have a stated maturity through  however  the expected maturity is subject to change based on the prepayments and loan losses of the underlying mortgage loans 
in addition  we may exercise a redemption option and thereby effect termination and early retirement of the mortgage backed notes 
the payments represented reflect our assumptions for prepayment and credit losses at december  and assume we will exercise our redemption option 
certain of our junior subordinated notes bear interest at a fixed rate per annum through march  and  thereafter  at a variable rate 
payments due by period reflect total principal due on all junior subordinated notes plus interest payments due during the fixed rate period of certain of the notes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary components of our market risk are credit risk and interest rate risk as described below 
while we do not seek to avoid risk completely  we do seek to assume risk that can be quantified from historical experience  to manage that risk  to earn sufficient compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake or to which we are exposed 
credit risk we are subject to credit risk in connection with our investments in residential mortgage loans and credit sensitive mortgage backed securities rated below aaa 
the credit risk related to these investments 
table of contents pertains to the ability and willingness of the borrowers to pay  which is assessed before credit is granted or renewed and periodically reviewed throughout the loan or security term 
we believe that loan credit quality is primarily determined by the borrowers credit profiles and loan characteristics 
we use a comprehensive credit review process 
our analysis of loans includes borrower profiles  as well as valuation and appraisal data 
our resources include sophisticated industry and rating agency software 
we also outsource underwriting services to review higher risk loans  either due to borrower credit profiles or collateral valuation issues 
in addition to statistical sampling techniques  we create adverse credit and valuation samples  which we individually review 
we reject loans that fail to conform to our standards 
we accept only those loans which meet our careful underwriting criteria 
once we own a loan  our surveillance process includes ongoing analysis through our proprietary data warehouse and servicer files 
we are proactive in our analysis of payment behavior and in loss mitigation through our servicing relationships 
we are also subject to credit risk in connection with our investments in mortgage backed securities in our spread portfolio  which is mitigated by holding securities that are either guaranteed by government or government sponsored agencies or have credit ratings of aaa 
concentration risk inadequate diversification of our loan portfolio  such as geographic regions  may result in losses 
as part of our underwriting process  we diversify the geographic concentration risk exposure in our portfolios 
interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in residential mortgage loans  adjustable rate  hybrid adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage backed securities and our related debt obligations  which include mortgage backed notes  warehouse lending facilities  derivative contracts and repurchase agreements 
effect on net interest income we finance our mortgage loans held for investment through a combination of warehouse lending facilities initially  and non recourse mortgage backed notes following the securitization of our loans 
our mortgage loan assets consist of a combination of adjustable rate mortgage loans and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans 
the interest rates on our warehouse lending facilities and non recourse mortgage backed notes generally reset on a monthly basis 
in general  we use derivative contracts to match fund the cost of our related borrowings with the income that we expect to earn from our hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans that currently have fixed coupon rates 
if our hedging activities are effective  over a variety of interest rate scenarios the change in income from our mortgage loans held for investment  plus the benefit or cost of our related hedging activities  will generally offset the change in the cost of our related borrowings such that the net interest spread from our mortgage loans will remain substantially unchanged 
we finance our adjustable rate  hybrid adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage backed securities with short term borrowings under repurchase agreements 
during periods of rising interest rates  the borrowing costs associated with hybrid adjustable rate during the fixed rate component of such securities and fixed rate mortgage backed securities tend to increase while the income earned on such hybrid adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage backed securities may remain substantially unchanged 
this effect results in a narrowing of the net interest spread between the related assets and borrowings with respect to our hybrid adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage backed securities and may even result in losses 
with respect to our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  during a period of rising interest rates the adjustable coupon rates on our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities would increase along with the increase in their related borrowing costs such that the net interest spread on these assets would remain substantially unchanged 
as a means to mitigate the negative impact of a rising interest rate environment on the net interest spread of our hybrid adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage backed securities  we may enter into derivative 
table of contents contracts  such as eurodollar futures contracts  interest rate swap contracts  interest rate cap contracts and swaption contracts 
hedging techniques are based  in part  on assumed levels of prepayments of the hybrid adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage backed securities that are being hedged 
if actual prepayments are slower or faster than assumed  the life of the hybrid adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage backed securities being hedged will be longer or shorter  which could reduce the effectiveness of any hedging strategies that we may utilize and may result in losses on such transactions 
hedging strategies involving the use of derivative securities are highly complex and may produce volatile returns 
all of our hedging activities are also limited by the asset and sources of income requirements applicable to us as a reit 
extension risk hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities have interest rates that are fixed for the first few years of the mortgage loan or mortgage backed security typically three  five  seven or years and thereafter their interest rates reset periodically 
at december   of our total mortgage assets were comprised of hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans and there were no hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
we compute the projected weighted average life of our hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities based on the market s assumptions regarding the rate at which the borrowers will prepay our hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans and the mortgage loans underlying our hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
during a period of interest rate increases  prepayment rates on our hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans and the mortgage loans underlying our hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities may decrease see prepayment risk below and cause the weighted average life of our hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities to lengthen 
during a period of interest rate decreases  prepayment rates on our hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans and the mortgage loans underlying our hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities may increase see prepayment risk below and cause the weighted average life of our hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities to shorten 
the possibility that our hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities may lengthen due to slower prepayment activity is commonly known as extension risk 
when we acquire hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans or hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  and finance them with borrowings  we may  but are not required to  enter into derivative contracts to effectively fix  or hedge  our borrowing costs for a period close to the anticipated weighted average life of the fixed rate portion of the related hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loan or hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed security 
this hedging strategy is designed to protect us from rising interest rates because the borrowing costs are fixed for the duration of the fixed rate portion of the related hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loan or hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed security 
depending upon the type of derivative contract that we use to hedge these borrowing costs however  extension risk related to the hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans or hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities being hedged may cause a mismatch with the hedging instruments and negatively impact the desired result from our hedging activities 
in extreme situations  we may be forced to sell assets and incur losses to maintain adequate liquidity 
certain mortgage loans that we purchase directly and certain mortgage loans collateralizing mortgage backed securities that we purchase permit negative amortization 
a negative amortization provision in a mortgage loan allows the borrower to defer payment of a portion or all of the monthly interest accrued on the mortgage loan and to add the deferred interest amount to the principal balance of the mortgage loan 
as a result  during periods of negative amortization the principal balances of negatively amortizing mortgage loans will increase and their weighted average lives will extend 
interest rate cap risk we also invest in residential mortgage loans and adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities that are based on mortgages that are typically subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate 
table of contents caps 
these interest rate caps limit the amount by which the coupon rate of these mortgage loans and adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities may change during any given period 
however  the borrowing costs related to our mortgage assets are not subject to similar restrictions 
therefore  in a period of increasing interest rates  interest rate costs on the borrowings for our mortgage assets could increase without the limitation of interest rate caps  while the corresponding increase in coupon rates on our residential mortgage loans and adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities could be limited by interest rate caps 
this problem will be magnified to the extent that we acquire mortgage loans and adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities that are not based on mortgages that are fully indexed 
in addition  our residential mortgage loans and adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in some portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding 
the presence of these payment caps could result in our receipt of less cash income on our residential mortgage loans and adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities than we need in order to pay the interest cost on our related borrowings 
these factors could lower our net interest income or cause a net loss during periods of rising interest rates  which would negatively impact our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
we may purchase a variety of hedging instruments to mitigate these risks 
prepayment risk prepayments are the full or partial unscheduled repayment of principal prior to the original term to maturity of a loan 
prepayment rates for mortgage loans and mortgage loans underlying mortgage backed securities generally increase when prevailing interest rates fall below the market rate existing when the mortgages were originated 
prepayment rates on adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities generally increase when the difference between long term and short term interest rates declines or becomes negative 
prepayments of mortgage backed securities could harm our results of operations in several ways 
some of our adjustable rate mortgage loans and the mortgage loans underlying our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities may bear initial teaser interest rates that are lower than their fully indexed rate  which refers to the applicable index rates plus a margin 
in the event that we owned such an adjustable rate mortgage loan or adjustable rate mortgage backed security and it is prepaid prior to or soon after the time of adjustment to a fully indexed rate  then we would have held such loan or security while it was less profitable and lost the opportunity to receive interest at the fully indexed rate over the expected life of the mortgage loan or adjustable rate mortgage backed security 
in addition  we currently own mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities that were purchased at a premium 
the prepayment of such mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities at a rate faster than anticipated would result in a write off of any remaining capitalized premium amount and a consequent reduction of our net interest income by such amount 
finally  in the event that we are unable to acquire new mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities to replace the prepaid mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  our financial condition  cash flow and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
at december   of our mortgage loans contained prepayment penalty provisions 
generally  mortgage loans with prepayment penalty provisions are less likely to prepay than loans without prepayment penalty provisions 
effect on fair value another component of interest rate risk is the effect changes in interest rates will have on the market value of our assets  liabilities and our hedging instruments 
we are exposed to the risk that the market value of our assets will increase or decrease at different rates from those of our liabilities and our interest rate hedge instruments 
we primarily assess our interest rate risk by estimating the duration of our assets  liabilities and hedging instruments 
duration essentially measures the market price volatility of financial instruments as interest rates change 
we generally calculate duration using various financial models and empirical data 
different models and methodologies can produce different duration numbers for the same financial instruments 

table of contents the following sensitivity analysis table shows the estimated impact on the fair value of our interest rate sensitive investments  repurchase agreement liabilities  mortgage backed notes  junior subordinated notes and hedge instruments at december   assuming rates instantaneously fall basis points  rise basis points and rise basis points dollars in millions interest rates interest rates interest rates fall rise rise basis points unchanged basis points basis points mortgage backed securities fair value change in fair value change as a percent of fair value hedge instruments fair value change in fair value change as a percent of fair value nm nm nm mortgage loans held for investment fair value change in fair value change as a percent of fair value mortgage backed notes float monthly fair value change in fair value change as a percent of fair value mortgage backed notes hybrid fair value change in fair value change as a percent of fair value repurchase agreements fair value change in fair value change as a percent of fair value commercial paper facility fair value change in fair value change as a percent of fair value warehouse lending facilities fair value change in fair value change as a percent of fair value junior subordinated notes fair value change in fair value change as a percent of fair value we invest in credit default swaps  or cds 
due to the complex nature of cds  we are unable to model the fair value of these instruments when rates change  and therefore  no impact is reflected in the sensitivity analysis 
this asset or liability is carried on the consolidated balance sheet at amortized cost and therefore a change in interest rates would not affect the carrying value of the asset or liability 
represents mortgage backed notes which have interest rates that reset monthly 
represents mortgage backed notes which have interest rates that are fixed for a specific period of time and then reset monthly 
the fair value of the repurchase agreements  commercial paper facility and warehouse lending facilities would not change materially due to the short term nature of these instruments 
nm not meaningful 
table of contents it is important to note that the impact of changing interest rates on fair value can change significantly when interest rates change beyond basis points from current levels 
therefore  the volatility in the fair value of our assets could increase significantly when interest rates change beyond basis points 
in addition  other factors impact the fair value of our interest rate sensitive investments and hedging instruments  such as the shape of the yield curve  market expectations as to future interest rate changes and other market conditions 
accordingly  in the event of changes in actual interest rates  the change in the fair value of our assets would likely differ from that shown above and such difference might be material and adverse to our stockholders 
risk management to the extent consistent with maintaining our status as a reit  we seek to manage our interest rate risk exposure to protect our portfolio of mortgage backed securities and related debt against the effects of major interest rate changes 
we generally seek to manage our interest rate risk by monitoring and adjusting  if necessary  the reset index and interest rate related to our mortgage backed securities and our borrowings  attempting to structure our borrowing agreements to have a range of different maturities  terms  amortizations and interest rate adjustment periods  using derivatives  financial futures  swaps  options  caps  floors and forward sales to adjust the interest rate sensitivity of our mortgage backed securities and our borrowings  and actively managing  on an aggregate basis  the interest rate indices  interest rate adjustment periods and gross reset margins of our mortgage backed securities and the interest rate indices and adjustment periods of our borrowings
