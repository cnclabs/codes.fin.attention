item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a radio broadcasting company whose primary business is acquiring  developing  and operating radio stations throughout the united states 
we own and operate radio stations in the following markets atlanta  ga  boston  ma  philadelphia  pa  miami ft 
lauderdale  fl  las vegas  nv  west palm beach boca raton  fl  ft 
myers naples  fl  greenville new bern jacksonville  nc  fayetteville  nc and augusta  ga 
over the past two years  we have experienced a more competitive environment in our markets and the radio broadcasting industry in general which has resulted in slower growth in our net revenues 
we expect the more competitive environment to continue 
in response to the slower growth in our net revenues we have focused on improving the operations at our radio stations through investment in programming  promotions and sales while continuing to monitor costs and expenses in other areas 
recent developments on february   we acquired the assets of wjbr fm in wilmington  de from nextmedia group  inc for million 
this acquisition was financed with million of borrowings under our credit facility 
we began operating wjbr fm under a local marketing agreement lma with nextmedia group  inc on october  we have included revenues earned and expenses incurred  including the associated fee  under the lma in our results of operations during the term of the lma  which expired upon completion of this acquisition 
the transaction was structured as a reverse like kind exchange in which we assigned our rights under the asset purchase agreement to a qualified intermediary in accordance with section of the internal revenue code 
however  no assurance can be given that the transaction will qualify as a like kind exchange under section of the internal revenue code or that we will achieve any tax savings as a result of this structure 
on february   we began operating wjbr fm under a local marketing agreement with the qualified intermediary 
we will include revenues earned and expenses incurred  including the associated fee  under the lma in our results of operations during the term of the lma  which will expire upon the transfer of wjbr fm from the qualified intermediary back to us no later than july  on december   we entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement to acquire kbet am in las vegas  nv for million 
we expect to complete this acquisition during the first quarter of however  it is subject to certain conditions  including fcc approval 
we intend to finance this acquisition with cash on hand 
financial statement presentation the following discussion provides a brief description of certain key items that appear in our consolidated financial statements and general factors that impact these items 
net revenue 
our net revenue is primarily derived from the sale of advertising airtime to local and national advertisers 
net revenue is gross revenue less agency commissions 
local revenue generally consists of advertising airtime sales to advertisers in a radio station s local market either directly to the advertiser or through the advertiser s agency 
national revenue generally consists of advertising airtime sales to agencies purchasing advertising for multiple markets 
national sales are generally facilitated by our national representation firm  which serves as our agent in these transactions 
the advertising rates that we are able to charge and the number of advertisements that we can broadcast without jeopardizing listener levels generally determine our net revenue 
advertising rates are primarily based on the following factors a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers as measured principally by quarterly reports issued by the arbitron ratings company  
table of contents the number of radio stations  as well as other forms of media  in the market competing for the attention of the same demographic groups  the supply of  and demand for  radio advertising time  and the size of the market 
our net revenue is affected by general economic conditions  competition and our ability to improve operations at our market clusters 
seasonal revenue fluctuations are also common in the radio broadcasting industry and are primarily due to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
our revenues are typically lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
we use trade sales agreements to reduce cash paid for operating costs and expenses by exchanging advertising airtime for goods or services  however  we endeavor to minimize trade revenue in order to maximize cash revenue from our available airtime 
the following summary table presents a comparison of our trade sales revenue and expenses 
year ended december  trade revenue trade expenses operating costs and expenses 
our operating costs and expenses consist primarily of programming  engineering  and promotional expenses  reported as cost of services  and selling  general and administrative expenses incurred at our radio stations  general and administrative expenses  including compensation and other expenses  incurred at our corporate offices  and depreciation and amortization 
we strive to control our operating expenses by centralizing certain functions at our corporate offices and consolidating certain functions in each of our market clusters 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate is approximately  which differs from the federal statutory rate of due to the effect of state income taxes and certain of our expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
impairment of fcc broadcasting licenses and goodwill 
we are required to estimate the fair value of our fcc broadcasting licenses and reporting units on at least an annual basis 
we combine our fcc broadcasting licenses into single units of accounting based on our market clusters for impairment testing purposes 
to assist in estimating the fair value of our fcc broadcasting licenses as of december   we obtained appraisals from an independent appraisal company 
the appraisal company estimated the fair values of our fm licenses using discounted future cash flows and the fair values of our am licenses using a market valuation approach 
the appraisal includes several assumptions and estimates including the determination of future cash flows and an appropriate discount rate 
if the appraisal company had made different assumptions or used different estimates  including those used to determine future cash flows and the discount rate  the fair value of our fcc broadcasting licenses could have been materially different 
for the purpose of testing our goodwill for impairment  we have identified our market clusters as our reporting units 
we used internally generated estimates of future cash flows 
table of contents to determine the fair value of each reporting unit as of december  these estimates required management judgment and if we had made different assumptions the fair value of our reporting units could have been materially different 
there can be no assurance that impairment of our fcc broadcasting licenses or goodwill will not occur in future periods 
impairment of property and equipment 
we are required to assess the recoverability of our property and equipment whenever an event has occurred that may result in an impairment loss 
if such an event occurs  we will compare estimates of related future undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flow estimates are less than the carrying amount of the asset  we will reduce the carrying amount to the estimated fair value 
the determination of when an event has occurred and estimates of future cash flows and fair value all require management judgment 
the use of different assumptions or estimates may result in alternative assessments that could be materially different 
we did not identify any events that may have resulted in an impairment loss on our property and equipment in there can be no assurance that impairment of our property and equipment will not occur in future periods 
valuation of accounts receivable 
we continually evaluate our ability to collect our accounts receivable 
our ongoing evaluation includes review of specific accounts at our radio stations  the current financial condition of our customers and our historical write off experience 
this ongoing evaluation requires management judgment and if we had made different assumptions about these factors  the allowance for doubtful accounts could have been materially different 
recent pronouncements in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab was issued to provide interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
sab is effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after november  effective december   we adopted sab with no material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
accordingly  sfas does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we have not completed our evaluation of the impact of the adoption of sfas 
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following summary table presents a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december  and with respect to certain of our key financial measures

year ended december  change net revenue cost of services selling  general and administrative expenses lma fees corporate general and administrative expenses interest expense net revenue 
the million increase in net revenue during the year ended december  was partially due to the million addition of net revenue from the local marketing agreement with wjbr fm in wilmington  de

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview 
our primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow and our credit facility 
our primary liquidity needs have been  and for the next twelve months and thereafter are expected to continue to be  for working capital  debt service  and other general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures and radio station acquisitions 
historically  our capital expenditures have not been significant 
in addition to property and equipment associated with radio station acquisitions  our capital expenditures have generally been  and are expected to continue to be  related to the maintenance of our studio and office space and the technological improvement  including upgrades necessary to broadcast hd radio tm  and maintenance of our broadcasting equipment 
we have also purchased or constructed office and studio space in some of our markets to facilitate the consolidation of our operations 
other liquidity needs for the next twelve months and thereafter may also include additional share repurchases and cash dividends 
our credit agreement permits us to repurchase up to million of our common stock and on june   our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase up to million of our class a common stock over a one year period from the date of authorization which was extended on may  for one additional year 
on may   our board of directors authorized us to increase the remaining balance under our previous authorization from million to million and to extend the repurchase period to may  as of february   we had repurchased million shares of our class a common stock for an aggregate million 
our credit agreement also permits us to pay cash dividends on our common stock in an amount up to an aggregate of million per year 
during the year ended december   we paid million for cash dividends 
on december   our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per share on our class a and class b common stock 
the dividend of million in the aggregate was paid on january   to stockholders of record on december  on february   we acquired the assets of wjbr fm in wilmington  de from nextmedia group  inc for million

on august   we acquired the assets of kdwn am in las vegas  nv for million 
this acquisition was partially funded with cash on hand  including proceeds of million from the sale of our radio towers located in west palm beach boca raton  fl  and partially financed with million of borrowings under our credit facility 
we expect to provide for future liquidity needs through one or a combination of the following sources of liquidity internally generated cash flow  our credit facility  additional borrowings  other than under our existing credit facility  to the extent permitted thereunder  and additional equity offerings 
we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to permit us to provide for our liquidity requirements and meet our financial obligations for the foreseeable future 
however  poor financial results  unanticipated acquisition opportunities or unanticipated expenses could give rise to additional debt servicing requirements or other additional financing or liquidity requirements sooner than we expect and we may not secure financing when needed or on acceptable terms 
as of december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents and had million in remaining commitments available under our credit facility  however  as of february   after completion of 
table of contents the acquisition of wjbr fm in wilmington  de  our maximum total leverage covenant would have limited additional borrowings to million 
our ability to reduce our total leverage ratio by increasing operating cash flow and or decreasing long term debt will determine how much  if any  of the remaining commitments under the revolving portion of our credit facility will be available to us in the future 
poor financial results or unanticipated expenses could result in our failure to maintain or lower our total leverage ratio and we may not be permitted to make any additional borrowings under the revolving portion of our credit facility 
we anticipate making additional share repurchases and future dividend payments instead of repaying indebtedness with such funds and if we incur additional indebtedness in order to make such repurchases or dividend payments  our total debt ratio may be adversely affected and we may not be permitted to make additional borrowings under the revolving portion of our credit facility

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our credit facility 
as of december   all of our long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and assuming a one percentage point increase in the current interest rate under these borrowings  we estimate that our annualized interest expense would increase by million and our net income would decrease by million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management may take actions to mitigate our exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this interest rate analysis assumes no such actions 
further  the analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment
