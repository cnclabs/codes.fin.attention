item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional analysis on seasonality 
we are subject to certain personnel related issues 
our success depends in large part on the abilities and continued service of our executive officers and other key employees 
although we have entered into employment agreements with several of our officers and employees  we may not be able to retain their services 
we also have non competition agreements with our executive officers and some of our existing key personnel 
however  courts are sometimes reluctant to enforce non competition agreements 
the loss of executive officers or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  in order to support our continued growth  we will be required to effectively recruit  develop and retain additional qualified management 
some labor markets are very competitive 
if we are unable to attract and retain additional necessary personnel  it could delay or hinder our plans for growth 
we are subject to a number of regulatory and contractual restrictions governing our relations with certain of our employees  including national collective labor agreements for certain of our employees who are employed outside of the united states and individual employer labor agreements 
these arrangements address a number of specific issues affecting our working conditions including hiring  work time  wages and benefits  and termination of employment 
we could be required to make significant payments in order to comply with these requirements 
the cost of complying with these requirements may materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 
our distribution activities and logistic services are labor intensive  and we experience high personnel turnover and can be adversely affected by shortages in the available labor force in geographical areas where we operate 
a significant portion of our labor force is contracted through temporary agencies and a significant portion of our costs consists of wages to hourly workers 
growth in our business  together with seasonal increases in net revenue  requires us to recruit and train personnel at an accelerated rate from time to time 
we may not be able to continue to hire  train and retain a significant labor force of qualified individuals when needed  or at all 
an increase in hourly costs  employee benefit costs  employment taxes or commission rates could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
in addition  if the turnover rate among our labor force increased further  we could be required to increase our recruiting and training efforts and costs  and our operating efficiencies and productivity could decrease 
we rely to a great extent on trade secret and copyright laws and agreements with our key employees and other third parties to protect our proprietary rights 
our business success is substantially dependent upon our proprietary business methods and software applications relating to our information systems 
we currently hold one patent relating to certain of our business methods 
with respect to other business methods and software we rely on trade secret and copyright laws to protect our proprietary knowledge 
we also regularly enter into non disclosure agreements with our key employees and limit access to and distribution of our trade secrets and other proprietary information 
these measures may not prove adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
our competitors could also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology  thereby eliminating one of our competitive advantages 
we also have offices and conduct our operations in a wide variety of countries outside the united states 
the laws of some other countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws in the united states 
in addition  although we believe that our business methods and proprietary software have been developed independently and do not infringe upon the rights of others  third parties might assert infringement claims against us in the future or our business methods and software may be found to infringe upon the proprietary rights of others 
we have significant future payment obligations pursuant to certain leases and other long term contracts 
we lease our office and warehouse distribution facilities under real property and personal equipment leases 
many of these leases are for terms that exceed one year and require us to pay significant monetary charges for early termination or breach by us of the lease terms 
we cannot be certain of our ability to adequately fund these lease commitments from our future operations and our decision to modify  change or abandon any of our existing facilities could have a negative effect on our operations 
we may be unable to obtain and maintain adequate business insurance at a reasonable cost 
although we currently maintain general commercial  property liability and transportation insurance in amounts we believe are appropriate  it has become increasingly difficult in recent years to obtain adequate insurance coverage at a reasonable cost 
our operations could be adversely affected by a loss that is not covered by insurance due to our inability in the future to obtain adequate insurance 
moreover  increasing insurance premiums would adversely affect our future operating results 
there are amounts of our securities issuable pursuant to our long term incentive plan and our amended and restated independent director stock compensation plan that  if issued  could result in dilution to existing shareholders  reduce earnings in future periods and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we have reserved a significant number of shares of common stock that may be issuable pursuant to these plans 
grants made under these plans could result in dilution to existing shareholders 
we have instituted measures to protect us against a takeover 
certain provisions of our by laws  shareholders rights and option plans  certain employment agreements and the indiana business corporation law are designed to protect us in the event of a takeover attempt 
these provisions could prohibit or delay mergers or attempted takeovers or changes in control of us and  accordingly  may discourage attempts to acquire us

item properties 
we provide our distribution and logistic services from our sales and operations centers located in various countries including australia  colombia  finland  germany  india  new zealand  norway  the philippines  slovakia  sweden  the united arab emirates and the united states 
all of these facilities are occupied pursuant to operating leases 
the table below summarizes information about our sales and operations centers by operating division 
number of aggregate locations square footage americas asia pacific europe refers to facilities operated by the company that are greater than  square feet 
we believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our current requirements and that suitable additional space will be available as needed to accommodate future expansion of our operations 
item legal proceedings 
the company is from time to time involved in certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of conducting its business 
while the ultimate liability pursuant to these actions cannot currently be determined  the company believes these legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations

a lower average selling price negatively impacted distribution revenue in our americas division by approximately 
the number of wireless devices sold through our americas distribution business increased primarily as a result of an overall increase in market demand and the addition of new suppliers and customers in and late manufacturers continued to launch new and innovative products and offer compelling pricing on products  which drove strong market demand 
during we believe we increased our market share with tier and tier operators through our preferred supplier agreements with revol and the associated carrier group acg 
we believe these preferred supplier agreements continue to enhance our relationship with motorola and other product suppliers within the regional carrier channel 
logistic services revenue increased to million in from million in growth in wireless devices handled contributed to of the increase in logistic services revenue  and growth in non handset based revenue positively impacted logistic services revenue in our americas division by 
these increases were partially offset by a lower average fulfillment fee per unit  which negatively impacted logistic services revenue in our americas division by 
the increase in wireless devices handled through logistic services in our americas division was due primarily to increased demand as a result of market growth experienced by current logistic services customers as well as expanded services offered to our current logistic services customers 
the growth in wireless devices handled through logistic services in our americas division was slowed by a decline in volume in colombia resulting from a decision by our primary network operator customer in colombia to reduce promotional activities significantly during the second half of due to market saturation in colombia 
the higher volume of wireless devices we previously handled in colombia was driven primarily by aggressive promotional activity by this operator customer in order to increase their market share 
as a result of this operator s decision to focus on profitability and asset management  we do not expect volume to return to levels we experienced in previous quarters 
average fulfillment fee per unit decreased primarily due to volume based tiered pricing as a result of certain of our current logistic services customers meeting volume thresholds to achieve a lower pricing tier during the fourth quarter of in addition  average fulfillment fee was negatively impacted during the fourth quarter of due to a reduced fee structure associated with the modification and extension of a logistic services agreement with a significant customer in our north america business 
based on our long term relationship with this customer  we believe that we will be able to mitigate some of this negative impact through new opportunities as well as improved profitability through anticipated efficiencies from automation and growth in unit volumes 
our logistic services revenue is derived from a mix of services with different fee structures from full pallet pick  pack and ship services to more complex software loading  kitting  customized packaging and individual handset fulfillment services 
while fee structures are higher for more complex services  we generally strive to maintain a consistent profit margin for each service

fluctuations in foreign currencies negatively impacted distribution revenue by less than in our asia pacific division in the increases in distribution revenue and wireless devices sold in our asia pacific division were driven by our brightpoint asia limited business  our operations in india and our expanded global relationship with a major original equipment manufacturer 
the increase in distribution revenue and wireless devices in our brightpoint asia limited business was a result of improved product availability at competitive prices 
the increase in distribution revenue and wireless devices sold through our operations in india was a result of increased volumes with our existing suppliers as well as diversifying our supplier base 
revenue in our asia pacific division also increased as a result of an expanded global relationship with a major original equipment manufacturer 
we made significant purchases of wireless devices near the end of september and near the end of december  which were procured under the terms of an existing supply agreement with this manufacturer in the philippines 
however  we intend to sell the products through all of our international operations including those outside of the asia pacific region 
sales of these wireless devices positively contributed to growth in distribution revenue in our asia pacific division  however  a significant portion of this inventory remained unsold as of the end of the terms of the purchase provided for more favorable payment terms than were reflected in the existing supply agreement 
the increases in distribution revenue and wireless devices from our brightpoint asia limited business  our operations in india and from this expanded global relationship were partially offset by a decrease in revenue and wireless devices sold through our distribution business in australia 
the decrease in revenue and wireless devices sold through our distribu tion business in australia was due to the decision by a certain network operator to change to a closed distribution model for g wireless devices as well as a change in terms with a significant customer in that market to a fee based logistic services arrangement from a distribution arrangement 
logistic services revenue remained relatively unchanged at million in increases in logistic services revenue in australia and india were offset by a decrease in logistic services revenue in new zealand 
the decrease in logistic services revenue in new zealand was due to the reduction in revenue from the sale of prepaid airtime in new zealand as a result of the decision by a major network operator to change from prepaid airtime cards to electronic distribution 
we are not participating in electronic airtime distribution in new zealand 
the increase in logistic services revenue in australia resulted from an increase in handset fulfillment revenue due to a shift to a fee based logistic services arrangement from a distribution arrangement with a significant customer in that market as discussed previously 
the increase in logistic services revenue in india was driven by an increase in volume and improved profitability on our repair business in that market

these increases were partially offset by a decline in revenue from the sale of accessories  which negatively impacted distribution revenue in our europe division by 
the increases in average selling price and the number of devices sold through distribution in our europe division were primarily due to increased demand for and availability of branded converged wireless devices as well as our entry into russia during the second quarter of in addition  we believe our europe division benefited from market share gains in sweden 
logistic services revenue decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease in logistic services revenue was primarily due to a shift in mix to fee based prepaid airtime fulfillment revenue from prepaid airtime distribution revenue 
this decrease was partially offset by growth in handset fulfillment revenue in slovakia and growth in revenue from repair services in germany 
the increase in handset fulfillment revenue in slovakia was due to increased volume with our primary network operator customer in that market as a result of promotional activity as well as expanded services offered to this customer

gross profit in our logistic services business increased to million in due to the increase in logistic services revenue and the percentage point increase in gross margin from logistic services 
the increase in gross margin from logistic services was driven by our asia pacific and europe divisions 
gross margin from logistic services increased in our asia pacific division due to improved profitability on our repair business in india as discussed previously 
the increase in gross margin from logistic services in europe was due to improved profitability on prepaid airtime sold in our sweden business including the shift in mix to fee based prepaid airtime fulfillment revenue from prepaid airtime distribution revenue 
the increases were partially offset by a decrease in gross margin from logistic services in our americas division 
our americas division experienced lower gross margin from handset fulfillment due in part to the reduced volume in colombia as discussed previously 
gross margin from handset fulfillment in our americas division also declined due to a lower average fulfillment fee per unit  a shift in mix to more complex handset fulfillment services for which we have yet to realize operational efficiencies as well as incremental costs associated with our new distribution facility opened in plainfield  indiana during the first quarter of our americas division continues to focus on leveraging our increased capacity through continued investment in automation and infrastructure 
the decrease in handset fulfillment gross margin in our americas division was partially offset by higher gross margin and gross profit from non handset based logistic services as a result of expanded services offered to current logistic services customers as well as a change in mix of services 
as discussed above  we modified and extended a logistic services agreement with a significant customer in our brightpoint north america business  which negatively impacted our profitability in december we expect profitability in our americas division to continue to be negatively impacted during based on our long term relationship with this customer  we believe that we will be able to mitigate some of this negative impact through new opportunities as well as improved profitability through anticipated efficiencies from automation and growth in unit volumes

incremental costs associated with our acquisition of persequor include personnel costs for information technology employees who have been working on global strategic information technology initiatives 
operating income from continuing operations in our europe division increased to million in from million in as a percent of revenue  operating income increased percentage points 
this increase was due to higher gross profit as a result of increased demand for and availability of branded converged wireless devices as well as our entry into russia during the second quarter of  partially offset by higher sg a expenses

interest expense was partially offset by interest income from short term investments 
at december   we had million of borrowings outstanding on our lines of credit 
the timing of payments to suppliers and collections from customers causes our cash balances and borrowings to fluctuate throughout the year 
in addition  in certain subsidiaries  our local lenders restrict the use of intercompany funds that can be used to pay down lines of credit 
during  the largest outstanding borrowings on a given day were approximately million  and average outstanding borrowings were approximately million 
there were no outstanding balances on lines of credit at december  during  the largest outstanding borrowings on a given day were approximately million  and average outstanding borrowings were approximately million 
other income expenses year ended december  change amounts in s other income expenses percent of revenue points the decrease in other expenses was primarily due to our decision to discontinue the sale of trade receivables to third party financial institutions in sweden and norway and the corresponding decrease in costs associated with the sale of those receivables 
other income for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to foreign currency transaction gains 
income tax expense year ended december  change amounts in s income tax expense effective tax rate points income tax expense for was million resulting in an effective tax rate of compared to an effective tax rate of for our effective tax rate is typically lower than the united states statutory tax rates primarily due to the benefit from foreign operations that have lower statutory tax rates than the united states 
new accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted the fair value provisions of sfas r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
prior to january   we used the intrinsic value method provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations to account for stock based compensation 
under the modified prospective transition method  compensation cost recognized for stock based compensation beginning january  includes a compensation cost for all equity awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b compensation cost for all equity awards granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r recognized using a straight line attribution method 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
as a result of adopting sfas r on january   income from continuing operations before income taxes and net income for the year ended december  are million and million lower than if we had continued to account for stock based compensation under apb total stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  was million net of related tax effects  compared to million that would have been included in the determination of net income had we continued to account for stock based compensation under apb basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  are lower than if we had not adopted sfas r 
in addition  sfas r requires cash flows resulting from tax deductions of stock based compensation in excess of the compensation costs recognized for those awards excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows  whereas  previously  we reported all tax benefits of deductions resulting from stock based compensation as operating cash flows 
as a result  the million of excess tax benefits classified as a financing cash inflow for the year ended december  would have been classified as an operating cash inflow if we had not adopted sfas r 
furthermore  under apb  grants of restricted shares were recorded in additional paid in capital apic with an offsetting amount to unearned compensation contra equity  which was amortized to expense over the vesting period 
however  under sfas r  amounts should not be recognized in equity until compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period 
therefore  the million unearned compensation balance at december  was netted against apic during the first quarter of as of december   total compensation cost related to non vested awards not yet recognized was million pre tax of which approximately one third will be recognized in each of the next three fiscal years 
in addition  we will recognize compensation expense for any new awards granted subsequent to december  as a result  we expect stock based compensation expense for to be greater than return on invested capital from operations roic we believe that it is important for a business to manage its balance sheet as well as it manages its statement of operations 
a measurement that ties the statement of operations performance with the balance sheet performance is return on invested capital from operations  or roic 
we believe that if we are able to grow our earnings while minimizing the use of invested capital  we will be optimizing shareholder value while preserving resources in preparation for further potential growth opportunities 
we take a simple approach in calculating roic we apply an estimated average tax rate to the operating income of our continuing operations with adjustments for unusual items  such as facility consolidation charges  and apply this tax adjusted operating income to our average capital base  which  in our case  is our shareholders equity and debt 
the details of this measurement are outlined below 
year ended december  amounts in s operating income after taxes operating income from continuing operations plus facility consolidation charge benefit less estimated income taxes operating income after taxes invested capital debt shareholders equity invested capital average invested capital roic estimated income taxes were calculated by multiplying the sum of operating income from continuing operations and the facility consolidation charge by the respective periods effective tax rate 
average invested capital for the annual periods represents the simple average of the invested capital amounts for the current and four prior quarter period ends 
roic is calculated by dividing operating income after taxes by average invested capital 
results of operations revenue and wireless devices handled year ended december  of december  of total total change amounts in s revenue by division the americas asia pacific europe total revenue by service line distribution logistic services total wireless devices handled by division the americas asia pacific europe total wireless devices handled by service line distribution logistic services total revenue for the year ended december  was billion  which represents growth of compared to growth in revenue was driven primarily by growth in the number of wireless devices handled in compared to overall  we estimate that worldwide industry shipments of wireless devices grew approximately to an estimated million wireless devices in demand for wireless devices continued to be strong in  driven by next generation product introductions  compelling pricing by manufacturers  accelerated deployment of wireless data services  and aggressive customer retention  acquisition and wireless device upgrade programs by network operators 
in addition to these industry factors  our growth in revenue and wireless devices handled also resulted from growth experienced by our industry leading customer and supplier base  increased penetration and market share with our existing customers and suppliers as our service offerings have increased  and successful additions of new customers and suppliers 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates impacted revenue less than 
total wireless devices handled during were million  which represents growth of compared to the million unit increase in wireless devices handled was due to a million  increase in wireless devices handled through logistic services and a million  increase in wireless devices handled through our distribution business 
the increase in wireless devices handled through our logistic services business is due primarily to our americas division  which handled more devices through logistic services in than it did in revenue and wireless devices handled by division americas year ended december  of december  of total total change amounts in s revenue distribution logistic services total wireless devices distribution logistic services total revenue in our americas division increased to million in from million in growth in revenue in our americas division was due primarily to a increase in wireless devices handled 
product distribution revenue increased in our americas division due to a increase in wireless devices sold through distribution and a increase in average selling price 
the number of wireless devices sold through our americas distribution business increased as a result of efforts to diversify and grow our base of handset suppliers lg and samsung in  an overall increase of market demand and improved product availability 
in addition  the largest supplier nokia in our americas division launched new innovative products during the second half of and offered compelling pricing on its products  which drove strong demand 
logistic services revenue increased to million in due primarily to an increase in wireless devices handled though logistic services handset fulfillment 
handset fulfillment revenue including freight revenue generated from handset fulfillment and other unit based service revenue represented approximately two thirds of logistic services revenue in our americas division for the increase in wireless devices handled through logistic services was due primarily to market growth experienced by our current logistic services customers 
growth in logistic services revenue in our americas division was also due to a significant increase in revenue generated from prepaid card distribution and fulfillment  for which units are not included in the total number of wireless devices handled through logistic services 
handset units handled in logistic services grew at a faster pace than revenue as our americas division experienced a shift in services  which contributed to a decrease in the average fulfillment fee per unit 
our logistic services revenue is derived from a mix of services with different fee structures from full pallet pick  pack and ship services to more complex software loading  kitting  customized packaging and individual handset fulfillment services 
while fee structures are higher for more complex services  we generally strive to maintain a consistent profit margin for each service see gross profit and gross margin 
in addition  the average fee per unit for logistic services decreased due to tiered pricing based on volume 
asia pacific year ended december  of december  of total total change amounts in s revenue distribution logistic services total wireless devices distribution logistic services total revenue in our asia pacific division increased to billion in from million in growth in revenue in our asia pacific division was due primarily to a increase in wireless devices handled 
product distribution revenue increased due primarily to a increase in wireless devices sold 
the increase in the number of devices sold through distribution was driven by growth in units sold in the india market  partially offset by a decrease in the number of wireless devices sold through our brightpoint asia limited business 
the increase in devices sold in india was the result of improved product availability and market demand for nokia cdma products 
the decline in devices sold through brightpoint asia limited was primarily due to competitors trans shipment of product from europe and the middle east during the second quarter of into markets we serve  at price points below that which were available to us from our suppliers 
increases in devices sold through our operations in australia and new zealand also contributed to growth in product distribution revenue 
growth in wireless devices sold through distribution in our asia pacific division may not continue in due to increased competition in the australia market 
logistic services revenue decreased to million in  compared to million in the decrease in logistic services revenue was due to declines in non handset fulfillment revenue for which units are not included in the total number of wireless devices handled through logistic services 
the decrease in non handset fulfillment revenue relates primarily to declines in prepaid recharge card revenue in the philippines market resulting from management s decision to reduce volumes of low margin products sold in that market 
europe year ended december  of december  of total total change amounts in s revenue distribution logistic services total wireless devices distribution logistic services total revenue in our europe division increased to million in from million in growth in revenue was due primarily to a increase in wireless devices handled 
product distribution revenue increased due to a increase in devices sold and a increase in the average selling price  partially offset by a decrease from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the increase in the number of devices sold through distribution in our europe division was due to increased demand for and availability of high tech computer corp 
s htc qtek branded smart phones  network operator promotional programs in certain markets  and our entry into finland during the second half of logistic services revenue increased to million in from million in although wireless devices sold through logistic services increased  handset fulfillment revenue represents less than of logistic services revenue in our europe division 
the increase in logistic services revenue was due to growth in prepaid recharge card revenue in our sweden business and our entry into the slovak republic in the second half of gross profit and gross margin year ended december  of december  of total total change amounts in s distribution logistic services gross profit distribution points logistic services points gross margin points overall  our gross profit was up in to million from million in this increase was primarily due to the growth in revenue 
the percentage point increase in gross margin was a result of the percentage point increase gross margin in our logistic services business 
gross profit in our distribution business increased to million in  which was due primarily to a increase in distribution revenue 
gross margin from distribution was flat despite higher margin handsets and increased leverage of our cost infrastructure in our americas division  which was offset by lower margin in our asia pacific division caused by increased competition in markets served by our brightpoint asia limited business from competitors located in europe and the middle east 
in addition  revenue from our business in india was a larger proportion of the total revenue in the division and has had lower margins than our other businesses in the asia pacific division 
gross profit in our logistic services business increased million or  to million in  which was primarily due to the growth in logistic services revenue 
the percentage point increase in gross margin was driven by our americas division 
our americas division experiences higher margins from logistic services than any of our other divisions  and the increase in logistic services revenue in our americas division improved our overall gross margin from logistic services 
this was partially offset by a decrease in the gross margin percentage in our americas division caused by a decline in our average fees for logistic services attributable to the mix of services provided  reduced fee structures with certain customers and changes in the scope of services provided to certain customers 
our logistic services revenue is derived from a mix of services with different fee structures from full pallet pick  pack and ship services to more complex software loading  kitting  customized packaging and fulfillment of an individual handset 
while the fee structures are higher for more complex services  we generally strive to maintain a consistent profit margin for each service

facility consolidation charge in september  our subsidiary in australia entered into a new facility lease arrangement  which commenced in the first quarter of we vacated our previous location in australia during the first quarter of  which resulted in a pre tax charge of million 
the provision includes approximately million for lease termination costs and non cash losses on the disposal of assets of approximately million 
at december   the remaining reserve of approximately million represents additional payments to be made to terminate the lease obligation 
the company does not anticipate making any other payments related to this facility consolidation 
during  we recorded a million benefit from our facility consolidation charge related to the richmond  california call center operation due to the fact that we terminated the lease for less than we had originally estimated

operating income was also impacted by the million increase in the facility consolidation charge during in our americas division  operating income from continuing operations increased to million in from million in as a percent of revenue  operating income increased percentage points 
the increase in operating income in our americas division was due to a increase in gross profit  compared to an increase in sg a of  which reflects increased efficiency and leverage of fixed costs at higher volumes 
operating income from continuing operations in our asia pacific division increased to million in from million in as a percent of revenue  operating income decreased percentage points 
this decrease was due to a decrease in distribution margin partially resulting from estimated non recoverable value added taxes 
in addition  operating income in our australia business was lower as a result of the million facility consolidation charge and higher sg a expenses as a percent of revenue compared to the lower operating income from our business in australia was partially offset by increased operating income from our business in india 
operating income from continuing operations in our europe division decreased to million in from million in as percent of revenue  operating income decreased percentage points 
this decrease was due to a decrease in operating income in our businesses in sweden and norway resulting from lower margins due to decreased demand for our products and services resulting from competitive pressures  which was partially offset by increases in operating income in our other businesses in europe including germany  slovakia and finland 
income tax expense year ended december  december  change amounts in s income tax expense effective tax rate points income tax expense for and was million and million  resulting in effective income tax rates of and 
the decrease in the effective tax rate from to is due primarily to the recognition of deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance had previously been recorded 
in entities that did not have a history of making profits were profitable  resulting in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets related to prior net operating losses 
also  as of the end of  our business in the united states had a significantly smaller net operating loss carry forward which increased the likelihood that alternative minimum tax credits may be utilized in the future and as a result  previously recorded valuation allowances against alternative minimum tax credits were reversed 
our effective income tax rate is typically lower than the united states statutory tax rates primarily due to the benefit from foreign operations that have lower statutory tax rates than the united states 
discontinued operations year ended december  december  change amounts in s loss from discontinued operations loss on disposal of discontinued operations total discontinued operations percentage of revenue points diluted loss per share loss from discontinued operations for relates primarily to losses incurred in brightpoint france of million  including a million non cash impairment charge to the value of goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in the third quarter of on december   our subsidiary  brightpoint holdings bv  completed the sale of all the equity securities of brightpoint france to an entity formed by the former managing director of brightpoint france  which resulted in a non cash loss from the sale of approximately million 
the loss on the sale of brightpoint france was partially offset by approximately million of tax benefits from previous disposals 
the loss from discontinued operations for was primarily attributable to losses incurred in brightpoint france of million 
the loss on disposal of discontinued operations for  was largely attributable to a million loss on the sale of brightpoint ireland  a million loss on the sale of one of our subsidiaries  brightpoint do brasil ltda  and unrealized foreign currency translation losses caused by the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
on february   our subsidiary  brightpoint holdings bv  completed the sale of its entire interest in brightpoint ireland to celtic telecom consultants ltd 
cash consideration for the sale was approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources consolidated statement of cash flows we use the indirect method of preparing and presenting our statements of cash flows 
in our opinion  it is more practical than the direct method and provides the reader with a good perspective and analysis of the company s cash flows 
year ended december  change amounts in s net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash used in operating activities was million in  a change of million compared to prior year primarily due to million more cash used for working capital 
the increase in cash used for working capital was due primarily to a million increase in our americas division resulting from increased payments to vendors during compared to the increase in payments to vendors was due to the timing of product receipts and related payments as well as the mix of vendors owed with which we have different payment terms 
in addition  cash used for working capital increased million in our asia pacific division 
the increase in cash used for working capital in our asia pacific division was primarily due to significant purchases of wireless devices near the end of september and near the end of december as part of an expanded global relationship with a major original equipment manufacturer 
cash payments to this manufacturer were greater than cash collected from our customers during the fourth quarter of cash used for working capital in our europe division increased million during compared to the increase in cash used for working capital in our europe division includes million used to discontinue the sale of trade receivables to third party financial institutions in sweden and norway during the first quarter of in addition  cash used for working capital in our europe division increased compared to as a result of the addition of product offerings and sales channels within the region 
million less cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities in compared to during  cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities included million of cash provided by reductions in cash collateral requirements as well as million of tax benefits from tax deductions on stock based compensation 
as a result of adopting sfas r  tax benefits from tax deductions on stock based compensation in excess of the compensation costs recognized for those awards excess tax benefits are required to be reported as a cash inflow from investing activities 
net cash used for investing activities was million for  an increase of million compared to prior year primarily due to million more cash used for capital expenditures during compared to the increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to investments in information technology infrastructure and software upgrades as well as equipment and leasehold improvements for new facilities 
million less cash provided from other long term assets during compared to partially offset by million more cash provided by contract financing arrangements 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  a change of million compared to prior year primarily due to million additional net proceeds on lines of credit during compared to million of excess tax benefits as a result of adopting sfas r 
million additional proceeds from stock option exercises during compared to partially offset by million additional purchases of treasury stock during compared to cash conversion cycle year ended december  days sales outstanding in accounts receivable days inventory on hand days payable outstanding cash conversion cycle days a key source of our liquidity is our ability to invest in inventory  sell the inventory to our customers  collect cash from our customers and pay our suppliers 
we refer to this as the cash conversion cycle 
the cash conversion cycle is measured by the number of days it takes to effect the cycle of investing in inventory  selling the inventory  paying suppliers and collecting cash from customers 
the components in the cash conversion cycle are days sales outstanding in accounts receivable  days inventory on hand  and days payables outstanding 
the cash conversion cycle  as we measure it  is the netting of days sales outstanding in accounts receivable and days inventory on hand with the days of payable outstanding 
circumstances when the cash conversion cycle decreases generally generate cash for the company 
conversely  circumstances when the cash conversion cycle increases generally consume cash in the form of additional investment in working capital 
during  the cash conversion cycle increased to days from days in the increase in the cash conversion cycle was the result of day increase in days sales outstanding in accounts receivable and a day increase in days inventory on hand  partially offset by a day increase in days payable outstanding 
the increase in days sales outstanding was primarily due to our decision to discontinue the sale of trade receivables to third party financial institutions in sweden and norway during the first quarter of the day increase in days inventory on hand was primarily attributable to our asia pacific and europe divisions 
the increase in days inventory on hand in our asia pacific division resulted primarily from significant purchases of wireless devices as part of an expanded global relationship with a major original equipment manufacturer 
the increase in days inventory on hand in our europe division was primarily a result of an increase in inventory in support of overall increase in volume as well as the addition of product offerings and sales channels within the region 
the day increase in days payable outstanding was primarily related to the large inventory purchases in our asia pacific division 
this expanded global relationship is still in the launch and development stage  and we intend to improve our cash conversion cycle as the related new sales channels are solidified and as the new distribution model is rationalized 
the detail calculation of the components of the cash conversion cycle is as follows a days sales outstanding in accounts receivable ending accounts receivable for continuing operations divided by average daily revenue inclusive of value added taxes for foreign operations for the period 
b days inventory on hand ending inventory for continuing operations divided by average daily cost of revenue excluding indirect product and service costs for the period 
c days payables outstanding ending accounts payable for continuing operations divided by average daily cost of revenue excluding indirect product and service costs for the period

lines of credit the table below summarizes lines of credit that were available to the company as of december  letters of credit net commitment gross availability outstanding guarantees availability amounts in s north america australia norway sweden slovakia total liquidity analysis we measure liquidity as the summation of total unrestricted cash and unused borrowing availability  and we use this measurement as an indicator of how much access to cash we have to either grow the business through investment in new markets  acquisitions  or through expansion of existing service or product lines or to contend with adversity such as unforeseen operating losses potentially caused by reduced demand for our products and services  material uncollectible accounts receivable  or material inventory write downs  as examples 
the table below shows our liquidity calculation 
december  change amounts in s unrestricted cash unused borrowing availability liquidity in september and december  we made significant purchases of wireless devices as part of an expanded global relationship with a major original equipment manufacturer 
as discussed above  the cash generated from selling this product was less than the payments we made to our vendor  which was the primary reason for our decrease in cash and liquidity 
this expanded global relationship is still in the launch and development stage  and we intend to improve our liquidity as the related new sales channels are solidified and as the new distribution model is rationalized 
we believe we have adequate liquidity to fund this investment in working capital 
we also believe that our existing liquidity as well as the additional liquidity provided from our new credit facility entered into on february  will be sufficient to operate our business for the next months 
refer to item a  risk factors 
further details regarding our new credit facility are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital resources capital expenditures were million  million and million for  and capital expenditures were primarily related to investments in our information technology infrastructure and software upgrades as well as equipment and leasehold improvements for new facilities  particularly in the us expenditures for capital resources historically have been composed of information systems  leasehold improvements and warehouse equipment 
we expect this pattern to continue in future periods 
capital expenditures for included approximately million related to our new dedicated distribution facility in louisville  kentucky  for which a portion of the capital expenditures were funded with amounts received from our customer as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect to invest in a range of million to million in a key component of our strategic plan is geographic expansion 
we expect our level of capital expenditures to be affected by our geographic expansion activity 
contractual obligations and commitments our disclosures regarding cash requirements of contractual obligations and commercial commitments are located in various parts of our regulatory filings 
information in the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period less than to to total year years years thereafter amounts in s operating leases third party debt and lines of credit purchase obligations letters of credit total reflects amounts included on the consolidated balance sheet including amounts owed under our line of credit in australia that was replaced in february purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex 
consequently  actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period as new information becomes available  or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
our estimates are based on historical experience  information from third party professionals and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee and the audit committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical based on the criteria above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements in any one period 
deferred taxes and effective tax rates we estimate the effective tax rates and associated liabilities or assets for each legal entity in accordance with sfas we use tax planning to minimize or defer tax liabilities to future periods 
in recording effective tax rates and related liabilities and assets  we rely upon estimates  which are based upon our interpretation of united states and local tax laws as they apply to our legal entities and our overall tax structure 
audits by local tax jurisdictions  including the united states government  could yield different interpretations from our own and cause the company to owe more taxes than originally recorded 
we utilize internal and external skilled resources in the various tax jurisdictions to evaluate our position and to assist in our calculation of tax expense and related liabilities 
for interim periods  we accrue our tax provision at the effective tax rate that we expect for the full year 
as the actual results from our various businesses vary from our estimates earlier in the year  we adjust the succeeding interim period s effective tax rates to reflect our best estimate for the year to date results and for the full year 
as part of the effective tax rate  if we determine that a deferred tax asset arising from temporary differences is not likely to be utilized  we will establish a valuation allowance against that asset to record it at the expected realizable value 
goodwill and long lived asset impairment we assess goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently when indicators of impairment are present 
at december   we had million of goodwill recorded as an asset 
we perform our annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter  and based on our analysis performed in  we determined no impairment was necessary for the remaining goodwill balance 
in our impairment analysis we estimate the fair value of an enterprise based on the present value of anticipated future cash flows 
we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the net assets of the enterprise exceed the present value of anticipated future cash flows 
we test our long lived assets for impairment whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
for long lived assets impairment testing  we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows  appraisals or other methods 
if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used  we recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset s carrying value 
the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset s new carrying value  which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset 
our long lived assets were recorded at their fair value and there were no material impairment charges in credit rating we are rated by standard poor s 
as of december   our rating was bb with a stable outlook 
standard poor s upgraded their rating for the company on april  from b to bb 
standard poor s downgraded our outlook to negative on february  seasonality we are subject to seasonal patterns that generally affect the wireless device industry 
wireless devices are generally used by businesses  governments and consumers 
for businesses and governments  purchasing behavior is affected by fiscal year ends  while consumers are affected by holiday gift giving seasons 
for the global wireless device industry  seasonal patterns for wireless device units handled have been as follows year st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter the seasonal patterns for wireless devices handled by us have been as follows year st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter forward looking and cautionary statements various statements  discussions and analyses throughout this annual report on form k are not based on historical fact and contain forward looking statements 
actual future results may differ materially from the forward looking statements in this annual report on form k 
future trends for revenue and profitability are difficult to predict due to a variety of known and unknown risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  i significant future payment obligations for wireless devices  ii loss of significant customers or a reduction in prices we charge these customers  iii possible adverse effect on demand for our products resulting from consolidation of mobile operators  iv dependence upon principal suppliers and availability and price of wireless products  v our ability to borrow additional funds  vi possible difficulties collecting our accounts receivable  vii our ability to increase volumes and maintain our margins  viii our ability to expand implement our future growth strategy  including acquisitions  ix uncertainty regarding future volatility in our common stock price  x uncertainty whether wireless equipment manufacturers and wireless network operators will continue to outsource aspects of their business to us  xi our reliance upon third parties to manufacture products which we distribute and reliance upon their quality control procedures  xii our operations may be materially affected by fluctuations in regional demand and economic factors  xiii our ability to respond to rapid technological changes in the wireless communications and data industry  xiv access to or the cost of increasing amounts of capital  trade credit or other financing  xv risks of foreign operations  including currency  trade restrictions and political risks in our foreign markets  xvi effect of natural disasters  epidemics  hostilities or terrorist attacks on our operations  xvii investment in sophisticated information systems technologies and our reliance upon the proper functioning of such systems  xviii possible adverse effects of future medical claims regarding the use of wireless devices  xix our ability to meet intense industry competition  xx our ability to manage and sustain future growth at our historical or current rates  xxi certain relationships and financings  which may provide us with minimal returns or losses on our investments  xxii the impact that seasonality may have on our business and results  xxiii our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel  cost of complying with labor agreements and high rate of personnel turnover  xxiv our ability to protect our proprietary information  xxv our significant payment obligations under certain lease and other contractual arrangements  xxvi our ability to maintain adequate insurance at a reasonable cost  xxvii the potential issuance of additional equity  including our common stock  which could result in dilution of existing shareholders and may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock  and xxviii existence of anti takeover measures 
because of the aforementioned uncertainties affecting our future operating results  past performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk concentration of credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk  consist principally of cash investments  forward currency contracts and accounts receivable 
we maintain cash investments primarily in aaa rated money market mutual funds and overnight repurchase agreements  which have minimal credit risk 
we place forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral to secure accounts receivable 
in certain circumstances  we have obtained credit insurance to mitigate our credit risk 
exchange rate risk management a substantial portion of our revenue and expenses are transacted in markets worldwide and may be denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly  our future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in specific countries political  economic or regulatory conditions and trade protection measures 
our foreign currency risk management program is designed to reduce  but not eliminate  unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates by hedging 
generally  through the purchase of forward contracts  we hedge transactional currency risk  but do not hedge foreign currency revenue or future operating income 
also  we do not hedge our investment in foreign subsidiaries  where fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our comprehensive income or loss 
an adverse change defined as a strengthening of the us dollar in all exchange rates  relative to our foreign currency risk management program  would have had no material impact on our results of operations for or at december   we had no cash flow or net investment hedges open 
our sensitivity analysis of foreign currency exchange rate movements does not factor in a potential change in volumes or local currency prices of our products sold or services provided 
actual results may differ materially from those discussed above 
interest rate risk management we are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates 
investments with interest rate risk include short term marketable securities 
debt with interest rate risk includes the fixed and variable rate debt 
to mitigate interest rate risks  we have  in the past  utilized interest rate swaps to convert certain portions of our variable rate debt to fixed interest rates 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our variable interest rate revolving lines of credit 
a increase in short term borrowing rates during the quarter would have resulted in only a nominal increase in interest expense 
we did not have any interest rate swaps outstanding at december
