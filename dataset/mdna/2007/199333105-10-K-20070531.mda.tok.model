item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
comments on the results of operations and financial condition below refer to our continuing operations  except in the section entitled discontinued operations 
executive overview we are a leading manufacturer and marketer of hoists  cranes  chain  conveyors  material handling systems  lift tables and component parts serving a wide variety of commercial and industrial end user markets 
our products are used to efficiently and ergonomically move  lift  position or secure objects and loads 
our products segment sells a wide variety of powered and manually operated wire rope and chain hoists  industrial crane systems  chain  hooks and attachments  actuators and rotary unions 
our solutions segment designs  manufactures  and installs application specific material handling systems and solutions for end users to improve workstation and facility wide work flow 
founded in  we have grown to our current leadership position through organic growth and also as the result of the businesses we acquired between february and april we have developed our leading market position over our year history by emphasizing technological innovation  manufacturing excellence and superior after sale service 
in addition  the acquisitions significantly broadened our product lines and services and expanded our geographic reach  end user markets and customer base 
integration of the operations of the acquired businesses with our previously existing businesses is substantially complete 
ongoing integration activities include improving our productivity and extending our sales activities to the european and asian marketplaces 
we are executing those initiatives through our lean manufacturing efforts new product development and expanded sales activities 
shareholder value will be enhanced through continued emphasis on the improvement of the fundamentals including manufacturing efficiency  cost containment  efficient capital investment  market expansion and renewed customer focus 
we maintain a strong domestic market share with significant leading north american market positions in hoists  lifting and sling chain  and forged attachments 
to broaden our product offering in markets where we have a strong competitive position as well as to facilitate penetration into new geographic markets  we have heightened our new product development activities 
this includes the recent introduction of powered hoist lines in accordance with international standards  to complement our current offering of hoist products designed in accordance with us standards 
to further expand our global sales  we are introducing certain of our products that historically have been distributed only in north america and also introducing new products through our existing european distribution network 
furthermore  we are working to build a distribution network in china to capture an anticipated growing demand for material handling products as that economy continues to industrialize 
we have recently reorganized our management team to align with these strategic initiatives 
these investments in international markets and new products are part of our focus on our greatest opportunities for growth 
management believes that the growth rate of total sales may moderate in future periods due to more difficult comparisons with our fiscal periods and a slower rate of us economic growth 
we monitor such indicators as us industrial capacity utilization  which has been increasing since july  as an indicator of anticipated demand for our product 
in addition  we continue to monitor the potential impact of global and domestic trends  including energy costs  steel price fluctuations  rising interest rates and activity in a variety of end user markets around the globe 
our lean manufacturing efforts continue to fundamentally change our manufacturing processes to be more responsive to customer demand and improve on time delivery and productivity 
from to under our facility rationalization program  we closed facilities and consolidated several product lines 
during fiscal  certain families within our mechanical jack line were eliminated and several smaller sales offices were closed with potential opportunity for further rationalization 
we are evaluating strategic alternatives of certain other businesses performing at levels below the corporate average  including univeyor  our material handling systems business 
in march  we sold one of our less strategic businesses  a specialty crane manufacturer 
additionally  our manipulator and specialty marine chain businesses were sold in fiscal we sold two pieces of excess real estate in fiscal  generating million of proceeds which were used to pay down debt 
during fiscal  we completed the sale and partial leaseback of a warehouse in ontario  canada at a million gain as well as the sale of an unused parcel of land in charlotte  north carolina 
fiscal saw the completion of the sale of a chicago area property resulting in a million gain and the sale and partial leaseback of our corporate headquarters building in amherst  new york at a million gain  of which million was recorded in fiscal and the remainder is being recognized pro rata over the life of the year leaseback period 
consistent with most us companies  over the past several years we have been facing significantly increased costs for fringe benefits such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance and pension 
combined  those benefits cost us over million in fiscal and we work diligently to balance cost control with the need to provide competitive employee benefits packages for our associates 
another cost area of focus is steel 
we currently utilize approximately million to million of steel annually in a variety of forms including rod  wire  bar  structural and others 
we continuously monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies 
we continue to operate in a highly competitive business environment in the markets and geographies served 
our performance will be impacted by our ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities in those markets and geographies  including trends towards increased utilization of the global labor force and the expansion of market opportunities in asia and other emerging markets

during fiscal  the company saw continued strength in the north american economy as well as increased demand in europe 
this growth was a continuation of improvement in the industrial sector of north america and europe that began in fiscal through the current period 
in addition  sales growth continues to be fostered by the expansion of international selling efforts 
net sales for fiscal of increased by million or from fiscal  and net sales for fiscal of million increased by million  or  from fiscal the products segment for fiscal experienced a net sales increase of over the prior year 
the increase was due to a combination of increased volume on the continued growth of the north american industrial economy and robust business in our european markets as well as price increases million 
fiscal was impacted by the continued weakness of the us dollar relative to other currencies  particularly the euro  and reported products segment sales were favorably affected by million 
the products segment for fiscal experienced a net sales increase of over the prior year 
the increase was due to a combination of increased volume on the continued growth of the north american industrial economy as well as price increases million 
our fiscal solutions segment net sales were flat as increased volume in our us operations was offset by a downsizing of our european material handling systems business resulting from our decision to be more selective in the projects we choose to accept due to a challenging market and pricing environment 
foreign currency fluctuations of the us dollar relative to the danish krone resulted in a favorable impact of million 
for fiscal  our solutions segment net sales were flat as increased volume was offset by the strengthening us dollar relative to the danish krone resulting in an unfavorable impact of million

del products segment solutions segment total gross profit del 
our gross profit margins were approximately  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the products segment for fiscal and fiscal continues to see improved gross margins as a result of operational leverage at increased volumes from the prior years across all businesses  the proportion of that increase in our most profitable products sales hoists  and the impact of previous facility rationalization projects and ongoing lean manufacturing activities 
the solutions segment s gross profit margins decreased in fiscal as leverage on volume increases at our us operations was offset by losses at our european material handling systems business 
the european systems business losses were the result of performance issues and cost overruns on certain projects  a challenging pricing environment and an unfavorable sales mix of projects 
the solutions segment s gross profit margins increased in fiscal as a result of a shift in product mix at our european material handling systems business to more internally developed product costs from resale products  increased volume at certain facilities  and some rationalization cost savings 
selling expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses were  and in fiscal  and  respectively

restructuring charges of million  million and million  or  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively  were primarily attributable to the ongoing organizational rationalizations occurring at the company 
the fiscal charges represent severance costs related to the reorganization of our european systems business million and demolition costs of the unused portion of a facility million being expensed on an as incurred basis  offset by a recovery of a portion of previous write downs million on a vacant facility that was sold during fiscal the fiscal charges consist of the cost of removal of certain environmentally hazardous materials million  inventory disposal costs related to the rationalization of certain product families within our mechanical jack lines million  the ongoing maintenance costs of a non operating facility accrued based on anticipated sale date million and other facility rationalization projects million 
the fiscal restructuring charges consist of million of costs related to facility rationalizations being expensed on an as incurred basis as a result of the project timing being subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
fiscal also included million of write down on the net realizable value of a facility based on changes in market conditions and a reassessment of its net realizable value

income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes for fiscal was 
income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes were not reflective of u 
s statutory rates in fiscal or a valuation allowance of million existed at march  due to the uncertainly of whether our us federal net operating loss carryforwards nols  deferred tax assets and capital loss carryforwards might ultimately be realized 
we utilized million of the us federal nols in fiscal reducing the valuation allowance by million 
as a result of our increased operating performance over the past several years  we reevaluated the certainty as to whether our remaining us federal nols and other deferred tax assets may ultimately be realized 
as a result of the determination that it is more likely than not that nearly all of the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized  million of the remaining valuation allowance was reversed as of march  the fiscal effective tax rate varies due to the benefit received from the utilization of the domestic net operating loss carry forwards that had been fully reserved  and jurisdictional mix 
in that year  income tax expense primarily resulted from non us taxable income and state taxes on us taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents totaled  at march   an increase of  from the march  balance of  net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the million decrease in fiscal relative to fiscal was primarily due to stronger operating performance in fiscal million offset by increased working capital components million 
changes in net working capital include an unfavorable change of million on inventory resulting from support for upcoming new product launches  a surge in demand for larger capacity equipment  and timing of offshore purchases and an unfavorable change of million in accounts payable and accrued and non current liabilities resulting from timing of disbursements  changing product liability reserves  and decreased variable compensation accruals 
these were offset by a favorable change of million on accounts receivables and unbilled revenues as a result of better collection efforts 
the million increase in fiscal relative to fiscal was primarily due to stronger operating performance in fiscal million and improved working capital components million 
the working capital changes come from favorable changes in inventory million  accounts payable and accrued liabilities million  offset by unfavorable changes in prepaids million and accounts receivables million 
net cash used provided by investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal change in cash used provided by investing activities is the result of increased capital expenditures  offset by increased proceeds from the sale of marketable securities and greater proceeds from asset sales 
the fiscal change in cash used provided by investing activities is the result of increased capital expenditures and lower proceeds from asset sales 
the fiscal  and amounts included million  million and million  respectively  from business and property divestitures 
net cash used in financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal includes million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
fiscal includes million of proceeds from the november stock offering  million from the exercise of employee stock options  and million of tax benefit from the exercise of stock options 
the fiscal  and amounts included million  million and million of debt repayment  respectively 
we also paid million of financing costs in fiscal to effect the capital transaction previously described 
we believe that our cash on hand  cash flows  and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations and budgeted capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
this belief is dependent upon a steady economy and successful execution of our current business plan which includes cash generation for debt repayment 
the business plan focuses on continued implementation of lean manufacturing  improving working capital components  including inventory reductions  and new market and new product development 
in march  we entered into a revolving credit facility  which provides availability up to million 
provided there is no default  the company may request an increase in the availability of the revolving credit facility by an amount not exceeding million if all the senior secured notes notes have been repaid in full or will be repaid in full contemporaneously with such increase  or million in the event that any notes remain outstanding  subject to lender approval 
the revolving credit facility matures february  however the maturity date can be extended to february based on certain conditions related to outstanding balances and the maturity date of the notes 
at march   the revolving credit facility was not drawn and the available amount  net of outstanding letters of credit of million  totaled million 
interest is payable at a eurodollar rate or a prime rate plus an applicable margin determined by our leverage ratio 
at our current leverage ratio  we qualify for the lowest applicable margin level  which amounts to basis points for eurodollar borrowings and zero basis points for prime rate based borrowings 
the revolving credit facility is secured by all domestic inventory  receivables  equipment  real property  subsidiary stock limited to for foreign subsidiaries and intellectual property 
the corresponding credit agreement associated with the revolving credit facility places certain debt covenant restrictions on us  including certain financial requirements and a limitation on dividend payments  with which we were in compliance as of march  the senior secured notes notes issued on july  for  amounted to  as of march  and are due august  the reduction resulted from purchases during fiscal and provisions of the notes include  without limitation  restrictions on indebtedness  restricted payments  asset and subsidiary stock sales  liens  and other restricted transactions 
the remaining notes are not entitled to redemption at our option  prior to august  on and after august   they are redeemable at prices declining annually from to on and after august  in the event of a change of control as defined in the indenture for such notes  each holder of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof 
the notes are secured by a second priority interest in all domestic inventory  receivables  equipment  real property  subsidiary stock limited to for foreign subsidiaries and intellectual property 
the notes are guaranteed by certain existing and future domestic subsidiaries and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
the senior subordinated notes notes issued on september  amounted to  and are due november  provisions of the notes include  without limitation  restrictions on indebtedness  asset sales  and dividends and other restricted payments 
until november   we may redeem up to of the outstanding notes at a redemption price of with the proceeds of equity offerings  subject to certain restrictions 
on or after november   the notes are redeemable at the option of the company  in whole or in part  at prices declining annually from to on and after november  in the event of a change of control as defined in the indenture for such notes  each holder of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof 
the notes are guaranteed by certain existing and future domestic subsidiaries and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
in november  we registered an additional  shares of our common stock which were sold at per share 
the number of shares offered by us was  and  were offered by a selling shareholder 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling shareholder 
this secondary stock offering increased our weighted average common stock outstanding by million for the year ended march  a portion of the proceeds received by us were used to redeem million of our notes 
the repurchase of the notes occurred at a premium resulting in a pre tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of million 
as a result of the repurchase of the notes  million of pre tax deferred financing costs were written off 
the net effect of these items  a million pre tax loss in fiscal  is shown as part of other income and expense  net 
the balance of the proceeds was subsequently used to purchase notes in open market transactions 
unsecured and uncommitted lines of credit are available to meet short term working capital needs for our subsidiaries operating outside of the us the lines of credit are available on an offering basis  meaning that transactions under the line of credit will be on such terms and conditions  including interest rate  maturity  representations  covenants and events of default  as mutually agreed between our subsidiaries and the local bank at the time of each specific transaction 
as of march   significant credit lines totaled approximately  of which  was drawn 
in addition to the above facilities  our foreign subsidiaries have certain fixed term bank loans 
as of march   significant loans totaled  of which  were secured loans

c we have no purchase obligations specifying fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased 
we estimate that  at any given point in time  our open purchase orders to be executed in the normal course of business approximate million 
d estimated for our senior secured notes due and senior subordinated notes due e as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have no additional off balance sheet obligations that are not reflected above 
capital expenditures in addition to keeping our current equipment and plants properly maintained  we are committed to replacing  enhancing and upgrading our property  plant and equipment to support new product development  improve productivity and customer responsiveness  reduce production costs  increase flexibility to respond effectively to market fluctuations and changes  meet environmental requirements  enhance safety and promote ergonomically correct work stations 
our capital expenditures for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
higher capital expenditures in fiscal and were the result of new product development and productivity enhancing equipment along with normal maintenance items 
we expect capital expenditure spending in fiscal to be in the range of million 
inflation and other market conditions our costs are affected by inflation in the us economy and  to a lesser extent  in foreign economies including those of europe  canada  mexico  south america and asia pacific 
we do not believe that general inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations over the periods presented primarily due to overall low inflation levels over such periods and our ability to generally pass on rising costs through annual price increases and surcharges 
however  employee benefits costs such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance  pensions as well as energy and business insurance have exceeded general inflation levels 
in the future  we may be further affected by inflation that we may not be able to pass on as price increases 
with changes in worldwide demand for steel and fluctuating scrap steel prices over the past several years  we experienced fluctuations in our costs that we have reflected as price increases and surcharges to our customers 
we believe we have been successful in instituting surcharges and price increases to pass on these material cost increases 
we will continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies 
seasonality and quarterly results our quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of large customer orders  periods of high vacation and holiday concentrations  restructuring charges and other costs attributable to our facility rationalization program  divestitures  acquisitions and the magnitude of rationalization integration costs 
therefore  our operating results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year 
discontinued operations in may  we completed the divestiture of substantially all of the assets of asi which comprised the principal business unit in our former solutions automotive segment 
proceeds from this sale included an subordinated note in the principal amount of million payable over years 
due to the uncertainty of its collection  the note has been recorded at the estimated net realizable value of principal payments received on the note are recorded as income from discontinued operations at the time of receipt 
accordingly  million of income from discontinued operations was recorded in fiscal all interest and principal payments required under the note have been made to date 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we continually evaluate the estimates and their underlying assumptions  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates 
we have identified below the accounting policies involving estimates that are critical to our financial statements 
other accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
the determination of the obligations and expense for pension and postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions that are used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are disclosed in note to our fiscal consolidated financial statements and include the discount rates  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of future increases in compensation and healthcare costs 
the pension discount rate assumptions of   and as of march   and  respectively  are based on long term bond rates 
the increase in the discount rate for fiscal resulted in a decrease in the projected benefit obligation as of march  the decrease in discount rates for fiscal and resulted in million and million increases in the projected benefit obligations as of march  and  respectively 
the rate of return on plan assets assumptions of  and for the years ended march   and  respectively  are based on the composition of the asset portfolios approximately equities and fixed income at march  and their long term historical returns 
the actual assets realized gains of and million in fiscal and our funded status as of march  and was negative by million and million  or and  respectively 
our pension contributions during fiscal and were approximately and million  respectively 
the negative funded status may result in future pension expense increases 
pension expense for the march  fiscal year is expected to approximate million  which is down from the fiscal amount of million due to an increase in the expected return on assets and lower amortization of unrecognized losses 
the factors outlined above will result in increases in funding requirements over time  unless there is continued significant market appreciation in the asset values 
pension funding contributions for the march  fiscal year are expected to increase by approximately million compared to fiscal including a million discretionary contribution above the minimum amount required by erisa 
the discretionary funding decision reflects an acceleration to comply with the pension protection act of the compensation increase assumption of as of march  and as of march  and is based on historical trends 
the healthcare inflation assumptions of  and for fiscal  and  respectively are based on anticipated trends 
healthcare costs in the united states have increased substantially over the last several years 
if this trend continues  the cost of postretirement healthcare will increase in future years 
insurance reserves 
our accrued general and product liability reserves as described in note to our consolidated financial statements involve actuarial techniques including the methods selected to estimate ultimate claims  and assumptions including emergence patterns  payment patterns  initial expected losses and increased limit factors 
other insurance reserves such as workers compensation and group health insurance are based on actual historical and current claim data provided by third party administrators or internally maintained 
inventory and accounts receivable reserves 
slow moving and obsolete inventory reserves are judgmentally determined based on formulas applied to historical and expected future usage within a reasonable timeframe 
we reassess trends and usage on a regular basis and if we identify changes  we revise our estimated allowances 
allowances for doubtful accounts and credit memo reserves are also judgmentally determined based on formulas applied to historical bad debt write offs and credit memos issued  assessing potentially uncollectible customer accounts and analyzing the accounts receivable agings 
long lived assets 
property  plant and equipment and certain intangibles are depreciated or amortized over their assigned lives 
these assets as well as goodwill are also periodically measured for impairment 
the assigned lives and the projected cash flows used to test impairment are subjective 
if actual lives are shorter than anticipated or if future cash flows are less than anticipated  we could incur a future impairment charge or a loss on disposal relating to these assets 
marketable securities 
on a quarterly basis  we review our marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered other than temporary 
we consider market value declines to be other than temporary if they are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess of of original cost 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
as of march   we had million of gross deferred tax assets before valuation allowances 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  million of the assets pertain to us federal net operating loss carryforwards nols and the remainder relate principally to liabilities including employee benefit plans  insurance reserves  accrued vacation and incentive costs and also to asset valuation reserves such as inventory obsolescence reserves and bad debt reserves 
the us federal nols expire in we reduced the deferred tax assets by million as a result of utilizing us federal nols in fiscal as a result of our increased operating performance in the past several years  during fiscal we reevaluated the certainty as to whether our remaining nols and other deferred tax assets may ultimately be realized 
as a result of the determination that it was more likely than not that nearly all of the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized  a significant portion of the remaining valuation allowance was reversed in fiscal our ability to realize our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income 
if we do not generate sufficient taxable income  we could be required to record a valuation allowance 
revenue recognition 
sales are recorded when title passes to the customer  which is generally at the time of shipment to the customer  except for long term construction type contracts 
for long term construction type contracts  we recognize contract revenues under the percentage of completion method  measured by comparing direct costs incurred to total estimated direct costs 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from final contract settlements  may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
in the event that a loss is anticipated on an uncompleted contract  a provision for the estimated loss is made at the time it is determined 
billings on contracts may precede or lag revenues earned  and such differences are reported in the balance sheet as current liabilities accrued liabilities and current assets unbilled revenues  respectively 
customers do not routinely return product 
however  sales returns are permitted in specific situations and typically include a restocking charge or the purchase of additional product 
we have established an allowance for returns based upon historical trends 
effects of new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin is an interpretation of fasb statement no 
accounting for income taxes and must be adopted by us no later than april  fin prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing  measuring  presenting  and disclosing in the financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take in our tax returns 
we are required to apply the provisions of fin to all tax positions upon initial adoption with any cumulative effect adjustment to be recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings as of april  fin is effective beginning in fiscal and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements  to define fair value  establish a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expand disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company is assessing the impact the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas 
among other items  sfas requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an entity s defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in the financial statements  requires the measurement of defined benefit postretirement plan assets and obligations as of the end of the employer s fiscal year  and requires recognition of the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in other comprehensive income 
we adopted statement in fiscal as discussed in footnote to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this annual report 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of this report may include forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by such statements  including general economic and business conditions  conditions affecting the industries served by us and our subsidiaries  conditions affecting our customers and suppliers  competitor responses to our products and services  the overall market acceptance of such products and services  the integration of acquisitions and other factors disclosed in our periodic reports filed with the commission 
consequently such forward looking statements should be regarded as our current plans  estimates and beliefs 
we do not undertake and specifically decline any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect any future events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
we are exposed to various market risks  including commodity prices for raw materials  foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we may enter into financial instrument transactions  which attempt to manage and reduce the impact of such changes 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our primary commodity risk is related to changes in the price of steel 
we control this risk through negotiating purchase contracts on a consolidated basis and by attempting to build changes in raw material costs into the selling prices of our products 
we also evaluate our steel cost increases and assess the need for price increases and surcharges to our customers 
we have not entered into financial instrument transactions related to raw material costs 
in fiscal  of our net sales were from manufacturing plants and sales offices in foreign jurisdictions 
we manufacture our products in the united states  mexico  china  denmark  the united kingdom  france  hungary and germany and sell our products and solutions in over countries 
our results of operations could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our operating results are exposed to fluctuations between the us dollar and the canadian dollar  european currencies  the mexican peso and the chinese yuan 
for example  when the us dollar strengthens against the canadian dollar  the value of our net sales and net income denominated in canadian dollars decreases when translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated results 
we are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in relation to purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
our foreign currency risk is mitigated since the majority of our foreign operations net sales and the related expense transactions are denominated in the same currency so therefore a significant change in foreign exchange rates would likely have a very minor impact on net income 
for example  a decline in the rate of exchange between the euro and the us dollar impacts net income by approximately million 
in addition  the majority of our export sale transactions are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  we currently have not invested in derivative instruments  such as foreign exchange contracts  to hedge foreign currency transactions 
we control risk related to changes in interest rates by structuring our debt instruments with a combination of fixed and variable interest rates and by periodically entering into financial instrument transactions as appropriate 
at march   we do not have any material swap agreements or similar financial instruments in place 
at march  and  approximately of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates 
at those dates  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of outstanding variable rate debt 
a fluctuation in interest rates in fiscal and would have changed interest expense on that outstanding variable rate debt by approximately million for both years 
like many industrial manufacturers  we are involved in asbestos related litigation 
in continually evaluating costs relating to its estimated asbestos related liability  we review  among other things  the incidence of past and recent claims  the historical case dismissal rate  the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs  its recent and historical resolution of the cases  the number of cases pending against it  the status and results of broad based settlement discussions  and the number of years such activity might continue 
based on this review  we have estimated its share of liability to defend and resolve probable asbestos related personal injury claims 
this estimate is highly uncertain due to the limitations of the available data and the difficulty of forecasting with any certainty the numerous variables that can affect the range of the liability 
we will continue to study the variables in light of additional information in order to identify trends that may become evident and to assess their impact on the range of liability that is probable and estimable 
based on actuarial information  we have estimated our asbestos related aggregate liability through march  and march  to range between million and million using actuarial parameters of continued claims for a period of to years 
our estimation of our asbestos related aggregate liability that is probable and estimable  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles approximates million which has been reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial statements as of march  the increase in the recorded liability from the amount of million at march  is due to the increase in historical data used to calculate required asbestos liability reserve levels 
the recorded liability does not consider the impact of any potential favorable federal legislation 
of this amount  management expects to incur asbestos liability payments of approximately million over the next months 
because payment of the liability is likely to extend over many years  management believes that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material after tax effect on our financial condition or our liquidity  although the net after tax effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period
