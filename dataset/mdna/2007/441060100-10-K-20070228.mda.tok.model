the majority of hospira s business outside the united states is conducted through contracting with individual hospitals or through regional or national tenders whereby hospira submits bids to sell its products 
hospira believes that backlogged orders do not represent a material portion of its sales or provide a meaningful indication of future sales 
product development hospira s development programs are concentrated in the areas of specialty injectable pharmaceuticals and medication management systems 
hospira also maintains an active development program to support its injectable pharmaceutical contract manufacturing relationships 
hospira primarily engages in programs to bring new products to market that are unique or that enhance the effectiveness  ease of use  productivity  safety and reliability of existing product lines  and that expand the use of hospira s products in new markets or new applications 
hospira operates product development facilities located in clayton  north carolina  lake county  illinois  mcpherson  kansas  morgan hill  california  and san diego  california 
hospira is actively working to develop and commercialize biosimilar products  which are sometimes referred to as generic versions of biopharmaceuticals or biologics 
biosimilar products are large protein molecules derived from genetically modified cell lines 
in  hospira entered into collaboration agreements with stada arzneimittel ag and bioceuticals arzneimittel ag relating to the development  manufacturing and distribution of a biosimilar version of erythropoietin 
therapeutic erythropoietin is used primarily in the treatment of anemia in dialysis and in certain oncology applications

hospira has entered into alliances with several leading information technology companies to develop interfaces that enable the hospira mednet system to be used with a variety of hospital information systems and to improve cost efficiencies in patient management 
hospira expects to continue entering into strategic alliances as part of its open system architecture strategy for the hospira mednet system 
hospira s research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in manufacturing as of december   hospira operated manufacturing facilities globally 
hospira s principal manufacturing facilities are identified in item of this report 
hospira closed its donegal  ireland facility in late  and expects to close the ashland  ohio facility later in and the montreal  canada facility by the first half of hospira expects to phase out production at the north chicago  illinois facility  which is leased from abbott under a year lease expiring in  on an accelerated time frame with most of the phase out occurring by early production of the primary products at these facilities is moving to other hospira facilities and or being outsourced to third party suppliers 
during  hospira began a million expansion of manufacturing capacity at the mcpherson  kansas facility  in part to accommodate some of the production from the north chicago facility 
hospira s two largest facilities  located in rocky mount  north carolina and austin  texas account for a significant portion of hospira s manufacturing output 
while hospira has not experienced a significant interruption of manufacturing at those facilities  such an interruption could materially and adversely affect hospira s ability to manufacture and sell its products 
raw materials and components while hospira produces some raw materials and components at its manufacturing sites  the majority of raw materials and components that it uses are sourced externally on a global basis 
hospira procures the active pharmaceutical ingredients in its drug products from third party suppliers 
although many of the raw materials and components hospira uses to produce its products are readily available from multiple suppliers  hospira relies on supply from a single source for many raw materials and components 
for example  hospira relies on proprietary components available exclusively from icu medical 
icu medical s clave and microclave connector products are components of administration sets that represented approximately of hospira s sales 
hospira also purchases a significant portion of its critical care products from icu medical  pursuant to its long term manufacturing  commercialization and development agreement with icu medical entered into during in addition  hospira purchases some of its raw materials and components from single suppliers for reasons of quality assurance  sole source availability  cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements 
in order to manage risk  hospira continually evaluates alternate source suppliers  although it does not typically pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of its existing supplier relationships  the reliability of its current supplier base  and the time and expense associated with the regulatory process 
although a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment by hospira in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to the performance of its products or incorporate unique technology  hospira does not believe that the loss of any existing supply arrangement other than its clave supply arrangement with icu medical  which continues through would have a material adverse effect on its business 
quality assurance hospira has developed and implemented quality systems and concepts throughout its organization 
hospira is actively involved in setting quality policies and managing internal and external quality performance 
its quality assurance department provides quality leadership and supervises its quality systems 
an active audit program  utilizing both internal and external auditors  monitors compliance with applicable regulations  standards and internal policies 
in addition  hospira s facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the us food and drug administration the fda and other regulatory authorities 
in the past  hospira s business has received notices alleging violations of applicable regulations and standards  and hospira has developed definitive action plans  implemented remedial programs and modified its practices to address these issues 
these matters have not materially impacted hospira s ability to market and sell its products 
competition hospira s industry is highly competitive 
hospira competes with many companies  both public and private  that range from small  highly focused companies to large diversified healthcare manufacturers 
hospira believes that the most effective competitors in its industry are focused on product quality and performance  breadth of product offering  manufacturing efficiency and the ability to develop and deliver cost effective products that help hospitals provide high quality care in an environment that requires increasing levels of efficiency and productivity 
hospira s most significant competitors in specialty injectable pharmaceuticals include abraxis bioscience  inc  baxter international inc and teva pharmaceuticals  as well as divisions of several multinational pharmaceutical companies 
local manufacturers of specialty injectable pharmaceuticals also compete with hospira on a country by country basis 
hospira s most significant competitors in medication delivery systems include baxter  becton  dickinson and company  b 
braun melsungen ag  cardinal healthcare inc  fresenius medical care ag and terumo medical corporation 
baxter  cardinal and patheon  inc are significant competitors of hospira s contract manufacturing business 
edwards lifesciences corporation is a significant competitor in critical care monitoring devices 
hospira believes that it is one of the leading competitors  in terms of us market share  in each of its major product lines  and believes that its size  scale  customer relationships and breadth of product line are significant contributors to its market positions 
hospira believes that it must continue to invest significantly in  and successfully execute  its research and product development activities  optimize its manufacturing efficiency and productivity  increase its international presence and successfully integrate mayne pharma s business into its operations to further its competitive position 
particularly  within its specialty injectable product line  hospira seeks to maximize its opportunity to establish a first to market position for its generic injectable drugs and  within its medication delivery systems product line  hospira seeks to differentiate its products through technological innovation and an integrated approach to drug delivery 
these efforts will depend heavily on the success of hospira s research and development programs 
patents  trademarks and other intellectual property when possible  hospira seeks patent and trademark protection for its products 
hospira owns  or has licenses under  a substantial number of patents  patent applications  trademarks and trademark applications 
however  hospira does not consider any one or more of these patents  patent applications  trademarks and trademark applications to be material in relation to its business as a whole 
employees as of december   hospira had approximately  employees 
approximately  employees were in the united states 
upon the completion of the mayne pharma acquisition  hospira had approximately  employees 
employees at the ashland  ohio manufacturing facility  and a significant portion of hospira s employees outside of the united states  are members of works councils or trade unions 
hospira believes that it generally has a good relationship with its employees and the works councils and unions that represent them 
governmental regulation and other matters laws and regulations that significantly affect hospira s business and operations are described below 
hospira believes that it is in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations  including those described below 
food and drug laws most of hospira s products and facilities are subject to regulation by the fda and national and supranational regulatory authorities outside the united states  including health canada health products and foods branch and the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products for human use 
hospira s marketed drugs and devices are subject to regulation with respect to  among other matters  manufacturing  post marketing studies in humans  advertising and promotional activities and materials  product labeling  and post marketing surveillance and reporting of adverse events 
all aspects of the manufacturing of regulated products are subject to substantial governmental oversight 
facilities used for the production  packaging  labeling  storage and distribution of drugs and medical devices must be registered with the fda and other regulatory authorities 
all manufacturing activities for these products must be conducted in compliance with relevant good manufacturing practices 
hospira s manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic and for cause inspections to verify compliance with good manufacturing practices 
new manufacturing facilities or the expansion of existing facilities will require inspection and approval by the fda and other regulatory authorities before products produced at that site can enter commercial distribution 
if  upon inspection  the fda or another regulatory agency finds that a manufacturer has failed to comply with good manufacturing practices  it may take various enforcement actions  including  but not limited to  issuing a warning letter or similar correspondence  mandating a product recall  seizing violative product  imposing civil penalties  and referring the matter to a law enforcement authority for criminal prosecution 
see item a 
risk factors hospira and its suppliers and customers are subject to various governmental regulations and it could be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 
hospira s sales and marketing activities for regulated products  particularly prescription drugs and certain medical devices  are also highly regulated 
regulatory authorities have the power to mandate the discontinuance of promotional materials  practices and programs if they include information that is beyond the scope of the indications included in the approved or cleared labeling or is not in compliance with specific regulatory requirements 
some of hospira s drug products are considered controlled substances and are subject to additional regulation by the us drug enforcement administration dea and various state and international authorities 
these drugs  which have varying degrees of potential for abuse  require specialized controls for production  storage and distribution to prevent theft and diversion 
violation of controlled substance statutes and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties 
hospira has begun investing in the development of biosimilar products  which are generic and or similar versions of currently marketed biologic pharmaceuticals 
in november  the european medicines agency implemented guidelines directed at the approval pathway for all generic biologic pharmaceuticals in the european union 
in the united states  there is no specific regulatory pathway for abbreviated approval of the majority of biologic pharmaceuticals 
for historical reasons  some biologic pharmaceuticals  such as human insulin and human growth hormones  are approved under the food drug and cosmetic act the fdca  while most other biologic pharmaceuticals are approved under the public health services act the phs 
the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of  which is generally known as the hatch waxman act  amended the fdca and established an abbreviated approval pathway for generic versions of referenced drug products approved under fdca 
although the fda has been willing to recognize an abbreviated approval pathway for generic versions of biologic pharmaceuticals approved under the fdca  the fda has been unwilling to recognize an abbreviated approval pathway for generic versions of biologic pharmaceuticals approved under the phs 
without a similar hatch waxman abbreviated approval pathway in the phs  it is unlikely the fda will approve a generic  or off patent  version of a referenced biologic pharmaceutical without independent clinical studies that support the products safety and effectiveness 
healthcare fraud and abuse laws as a manufacturer and distributor of prescription drugs and medical products to hospitals and other healthcare providers  hospira and its customers are subject to the federal anti kickback statute  which applies to medicare  medicaid  and other federal and state programs 
this statute prohibits the solicitation  offer  payment or receipt of remuneration in return for referrals or purchase  or in return for recommending or arranging for the referral or purchase  of goods covered by the programs 
the anti kickback law provides a number of exceptions or safe harbors for particular types of transactions 
hospira believes that its arrangements with its customers are in material compliance with the anti kickback statute and relevant safe harbors 
while hospira generally does not file claims for reimbursement from government payors  the federal government has asserted theories of liability against manufacturers under the federal false claims act  which prohibits the submission of false claims to medicare  medicaid  and other state and federal programs 
hospira believes that its arrangements with and actions in regard to its claims filing customers are in material compliance with the federal false claims act 
many states have similar fraud and abuse laws  and hospira believes that it is in material compliance with those laws 
if it were determined that hospira was not in compliance with those laws  however  hospira could be subject to criminal and or civil liability  exclusion from participation in medicare  medicaid and other state and federal programs  or other material adverse effects 
environmental laws hospira s manufacturing operations are subject to many requirements under environmental laws 
in the united states  the us environmental protection agency and similar state agencies administer laws which restrict the emission of pollutants into the air  the discharge of pollutants into bodies of water and the disposal of hazardous substances 
violations of these laws can result in significant civil and criminal penalties  and incarceration 
the failure to obtain a permit for certain activities may be a violation of environmental law and subject the owner and operator to civil and criminal sanctions 
most environmental agencies also have the power to shut down an operation if it is operating in violation of environmental law 
us laws also typically allow citizens to bring private enforcement actions in some situations 
outside the united states  the environmental laws and their enforcement vary  and can be more burdensome 
for example  in some european countries  there are environmental taxes and laws requiring manufacturers to take back used products at the end of their useful life 
this does not currently have a significant impact on hospira s products  but such laws are expanding rapidly in europe 
hospira has management systems in place that are intended to minimize the potential for violation of these laws 
other environmental laws address the contamination of land and groundwater  and require the clean up of such contamination 
these laws may apply not only to the owner or operator of an on going business  but also to the owner of land contaminated by a prior owner or operator 
in addition  if a parcel is contaminated by the release of a hazardous substance  such as through its historic use as a disposal site  any person or company that has contributed to that contamination  whether or not they have a legal interest in the land  may be subject to a requirement to clean up the parcel 
hospira has been involved with a number of sites at which clean up has been required  some as the sole owner and responsible party  and some as a contributor in conjunction with other parties 
the resulting costs tend to be in the form of legal expenses  contributions to the cost of the investigation or clean up of the contaminated sites  or settlement payments to reimburse the government for past remedial work 
safety and health laws in the united states  the occupational safety and health act sets forth requirements for conditions of the workplace 
hospira s operations are subject to many of these requirements  particularly in connection with hospira s employees use of equipment and chemicals at manufacturing sites that pose a potential health or safety hazard 
violation of these laws can result in civil and criminal penalties 
transportation laws hospira s operations include transporting materials defined as hazardous over land  over sea and through the air 
all of these activities are regulated under laws administered by the us department of transportation and similar agencies outside the united states 
they include complex requirements for packing  labeling and recordkeeping  and the failure to comply can result in civil and criminal sanctions 
customs laws the import and export of many goods across national borders are heavily regulated  especially in the united states 
as the importer and exporter of many shipments each year  hospira must comply with all customs regulations and pay fees and duties on certain shipments 
failure to comply can result in significant financial penalties and criminal sanctions 
other laws the laws of some states and foreign countries regulate the safety of hospira s products in the marketplace to a greater extent than fda requirements 
for example  under california s safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of  also known as proposition  the state has established a list of chemicals considered to be hazardous 
if  as a result of the sale in california of a product containing a listed chemical  a person is exposed to the chemical  the seller of that product must provide that person with a warning 
monetary penalties for non compliance can be substantial  although there are no criminal sanctions 
hospira is also subject to a variety of state and foreign compliance  disclosure and anti fraud laws  non compliance with which can result in significant financial penalties and criminal sanctions 
as hospira operates internationally  hospira is subject to us regulations that apply to international operations  including trade laws  the foreign corrupt practices act and anti boycott laws 
spin off from abbott hospira became an independent public company pursuant to a spin off from abbott laboratories on april  at that time  hospira and abbott entered into various agreements  including agreements that defined the parties rights and obligations regarding the spin off  transitional agreements to support hospira s business and commercial infrastructure  and lease agreements 
the parties also agreed that legal title to certain assets and liabilities used in hospira s international operations would be transferred to hospira over the two years after the spin off 
during  hospira and abbott completed the transitional agreements and all of the transfers of such international assets and liabilities 
some commercial agreements relating to the supply of products among the parties remain in place through  and the lease of the north chicago  illinois manufacturing facility remains in force through except as otherwise agreed by the parties  hospira assumed all liabilities of abbott and its subsidiaries to the extent relating to  arising out of or resulting from any matter occurring or existing prior to the spin off to the extent such liabilities relate to  arise out of or result from hospira s business and assets 
the liabilities that hospira assumed include  among other things  liabilities for any claims or legal proceedings related to products that had been part of hospira s business  but were discontinued prior to the spin off 
however  hospira did not assume certain liabilities of abbott or its subsidiaries relating to allegations in pending or future investigations and lawsuits that hospira s business engaged in improper marketing and pricing practices as described in item legal proceedings marketing and pricing cases 
in addition  abbott is liable generally for all pre spin off us federal income taxes  foreign taxes and certain state taxes attributable to hospira s business

mayne pharma also has established relationships with research and development partners in low cost and generic friendly environments  such as india 
in recent years  mayne pharma has also entered into a number of product in licensing agreements  involving the sale of products under license from third parties  to expand its product portfolio 
manufacturing facilities mayne pharma s principal manufacturing facilities are identified in item of this report 
mayne pharma s primary injectable drug manufacturing facility is its mulgrave facility 
products produced at the mulgrave facility generated a majority of its fiscal year revenue 
a significant disruption to its operations at this site  even on a short term basis  could materially hinder mayne pharma s ability to produce and ship products on a timely basis 
raw materials mayne pharma produces the active pharmaceutical ingredient for paclitaxel at its boulder  colorado facility and sources the active pharmaceutical ingredients for its other products from third parties 
mayne pharma has established relationships with a number of fda approved suppliers of active pharmaceutical ingredients and works very closely with them to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining material quality and reliability 
competition emea 
generic penetration rates in the emea region vary due to wide variations in the structure of health care systems including purchasing practices and government policies regarding the use of generic products and pricing  which all lead to differing levels of customer acceptance 
because the european market is fragmented  with different policies and levels of generic penetration in each country  the competition for generic pharmaceuticals is less intense than in the united states  which is a largely homogenous market with a higher level of generic drug usage 
in europe  competitors tend to vary by country and are often smaller than those in the united states  although some consolidation and geographic expansion is now occurring 
teva is the only company that competes with mayne pharma in the generic oncology market across the emea region 
mayne pharma s other key competitors vary from country to country 
asia pacific 
in australia  generic penetration is growing primarily due to changes in government support 
australian laws have been introduced to allow for easier compulsory substitution of generic for branded pharmaceuticals  as a response to pressure to reduce costs  which is believed to have resulted in an increased acceptance of generic pharmaceutical products 
competitors include the sandoz division of novartis  a number of smaller competitors and the innovator companies 
in the asian region  mayne pharma sells its products primarily to public and private hospitals 
mayne pharma s competition in the asian region tends to be with the innovator companies rather than local generic competitors 
united states and canada 
as significantly higher levels of expertise and investment are required for injectable oncology pharmaceutical product manufacturing than for oral dose pharmaceutical manufacturing  there are relatively few companies that compete in this market when compared to the larger oral generics market 
mayne pharma s main competitors include abraxis bioscience  bedford laboratories a division of boehringer ingelheim and teva

risk factors hospira s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those described below 
these risks and uncertainties may cause hospira s sales and results of operations to fluctuate significantly  hospira s past performance to not be indicative of future performance  and hospira s actual performance to differ materially from hospira s expectations or projections 
the risks described below apply to hospira s business after giving effect to the mayne pharma acquisition and may not be the only risks hospira faces 
additional risks that hospira does not yet know of or that hospira currently thinks are immaterial may also impair its business operations 
risks relating to the mayne pharma acquisition and related transactions the integration of mayne pharma into hospira s operations will present significant challenges 
on february   hospira completed its acquisition of mayne pharma limited 
hospira will face significant challenges in combining its operations and product lines with mayne pharma in a timely and efficient manner 
the mayne pharma acquisition was the largest in hospira s history  and successful integration will be important to hospira s future success 
in connection with the integration  hospira will identify and eliminate duplicative functions  retain other key functions and personnel  terminate various contractual arrangements and transition its management structure to the new combined company 
this integration will be complex and time consuming  may divert management away from day to day operations and may disrupt ordinary operations 
if hospira does not identify the right functions to be eliminated or retained  it may not realize the expected cost savings and synergies from the acquisition 
hospira may not be able to retain key personnel to efficiently operate the business 
integration of mayne pharma will also require hospira to modify its operational and financial systems and cause mayne pharma s internal control over financial reporting to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of the integration will result in significant additional expenses  currently estimated to be approximately million to million over the two year period following the acquisition 
the substantial majority of such expenses will be incurred in cash 
hospira may incur greater than expected costs in connection with the integration if it experiences difficulties or encounters issues not currently known to it 
as hospira and mayne pharma offer some similar products in the same markets  hospira may not be able to retain all historical sales of those products 
the failure to successfully integrate mayne pharma s business into hospira s business and manage the challenges presented by the integration process may prevent hospira from achieving the anticipated potential benefits of the acquisition  may lead to significant costs and may harm hospira s future profitability 
hospira has incurred significant indebtedness in order to finance the mayne pharma acquisition  which may limit its operating flexibility 
to finance the mayne pharma acquisition  hospira has incurred additional borrowings of approximately billion in the aggregate under a one year bridge loan facility and a three year term loan facility 
as a result  as of february   hospira had approximately billion of debt 
this significant indebtedness will require hospira to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its debt  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures  to pursue other acquisitions or investments in new technologies and for general corporate purposes 
during  hospira incurred approximately million in interest expense 
in  interest expense is expected to increase to approximately million to million  assuming hospira maintains its existing credit ratings and is able to refinance amounts due under the bridge loan facility in market conditions similar to current market conditions 
hospira will also be required to make minimum principal payments under the term loan facility of million in  million in and million in these amounts will be reduced if hospira prepays the principal in earlier periods 
in addition  this significant indebtedness will increase hospira s vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions  including increases in interest rates  and limit hospira s flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in or challenges relating to its business and industry 
the terms of the loan agreements contain restrictions on hospira s ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  create or incur liens  sell all or substantially all of its assets  and consolidate or merge with another entity 
hospira must also maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and is subject to a maximum leverage ratio throughout the life of the loan facilities 
if hospira does not comply with the covenants and restrictions under the agreements governing its indebtedness  hospira would be in default under the agreements and  if the lenders do not waive such default  the lenders may accelerate the amounts borrowed 
if the loans are accelerated  hospira may be unable to repay the amounts due to the lenders or obtain additional or replacement financing on favorable terms or at all  which would have a material adverse effect on hospira s financial condition 
hospira s credit rating has been downgraded by standard and poor s and future downgrades are possible 
a further downgrade will increase hospira s cost of borrowing 
as a result of the mayne pharma acquisition  hospira s credit rating was downgraded from bbb to bbb by standard poor s 
while moody s maintained hospira s credit rating at baa  which is the lowest investment grade rating  the rating outlook was changed from stable to negative 
it is possible that hospira s credit ratings could be further downgraded and fall below investment grade from both agencies 
the credit ratings assigned to hospira s indebtedness affect its ability to obtain new financing and the cost of financing and credit 
the amount of interest payable under hospira s loan facilities depends on hospira s credit ratings 
if hospira s credit ratings were to be further downgraded  its borrowing costs would increase  and its access to unsecured debt markets could be limited 
ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
hospira may not be able to refinance amounts borrowed under its bridge loan facility on favorable terms or at all 
hospira owes approximately billion under the bridge loan facility entered into to finance the mayne pharma acquisition 
the bridge loan facility matures in january hospira intends to refinance the bridge loan facility before it matures through the sale of long term bonds 
hospira s ability to refinance the bridge loan facility in a timely manner and at favorable terms depends on several factors  including hospira s credit ratings  general economic conditions  capital markets and interest rate levels 
hospira may not be able to refinance the bridge loan facility 
if hospira is able to refinance the bridge loan facility  the terms of the refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the bridge loan facility 
if hospira does not maintain investment grade credit ratings  it may be more difficult to refinance the bridge loan facility  the cost of borrowing would increase substantially and hospira would become subject to more stringent covenants and restrictions on its business 
if hospira fails to refinance the credit facility on favorable terms or at all  such failure could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition 
hospira will incur substantial charges relating to the mayne pharma acquisition 
in addition to integration related expenses  hospira will also incur other charges in connection with the mayne pharma acquisition 
these will include purchase accounting charges  such as the write off of in process research and development and the write up of inventory  as well as the amortization of intangible assets 
these charges will negatively affect hospira s results of operations 
risks related to hospira s business and industries hospira faces significant competition and may not be able to compete effectively 
the healthcare industry is highly competitive 
hospira competes with many companies ranging from small start up enterprises to multinational companies that are larger than hospira and have access to greater financial  marketing  technical and other resources than hospira 
hospira s present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by competitors or by the introduction of competing products by one or more of its competitors 
hospira faces strong competition from one or more large competitors in each of its major product lines 
to remain competitive and bolster its competitive position  hospira believes that it must successfully execute various strategic plans  including expanding its research and development initiatives  increasing its international presence and lowering its operating costs 
these initiatives may result in significant expenditures and ultimately may not be successful 
many of hospira s products are not protected by patents or other proprietary rights and are therefore not entitled to market exclusivity 
in the absence of patent protection  the introduction of competing products is limited primarily by market considerations and the need to obtain necessary regulatory approvals  which may not keep competitors from providing competitive products 
hospira s failure to compete effectively could cause it to lose market share to its competitors and or have a material adverse effect on its sales and profitability 
if hospira does not introduce new products in a timely manner  its products may become obsolete over time  customers may not buy its products  and its sales and profitability may decline 
demand for hospira s products may change in ways hospira may not anticipate because of evolving customer needs  the introduction by others of new products and technologies  and evolving industry standards 
a key component to hospira s strategy is effective execution of its research and development activities  in part to increase the breadth of hospira s specialty injectable product portfolio and to develop new and improved medication delivery systems products 
without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements  hospira s products may become obsolete over time  in which case its sales and operating results would suffer 
if hospira does not continue to develop generic injectable pharmaceuticals in a timely manner  its competitors may develop generic injectable pharmaceutical product portfolios that are more competitive than hospira s  and hospira could find it more difficult to renew or expand gpo pricing agreements or to obtain new agreements 
the ability to launch a generic pharmaceutical product at or before generic market formation is important to that product s profitability 
prices for generic products typically decline  sometimes dramatically  following market formation  as additional companies receive approvals to market that product and competition intensifies 
if a company can be first to market  such that the branded drug is the only other competition for a period of time  higher levels of sales and profitability can be achieved 
with increasing competition in the generic product market  the timeliness with which hospira can market new generic products will increase in importance 
if hospira is unable to bring its generic products to market on a timely basis  and secure first to market positions  its sales and profitability could be harmed 
hospira faces similar risks if it does not introduce new versions or upgrades to its medication management systems 
innovations generally require a substantial investment in product development before hospira can determine their commercial viability  and hospira may not have the financial resources necessary to fund these innovations 
even if hospira succeeds in creating new product candidates from these innovations  such innovations may still fail to result in commercially successful products 
it may take more time and effort for hospira to sell and implement newer technology medication management systems to its customers 
the success of hospira s new product offerings and enhancements will depend on several factors  including hospira s ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs  including increasing demand for lower cost products that help improve safety and productivity  innovate  develop  manufacture and implement new products and technologies in an economical and timely manner  differentiate its offerings from competitors offerings  achieve positive clinical outcomes for new products  meet safety and efficacy requirements and other regulatory requirements of government agencies  avoid infringing the proprietary rights of third parties  and obtain favorable pricing on such products 
even if hospira is able to successfully develop new products or enhancements or new generations of its existing products  these new products or enhancements or new generations of its existing products may not produce sales in excess of the costs of development  and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by competitors of products embodying new technologies or features 
finally  innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of  among other things  entrenched patterns of clinical practice  the need for regulatory clearance and uncertainty over third party reimbursement 
failure to effectively manage efforts under product collaboration agreements may harm hospira s business and profitability 
in many cases  hospira collaborates with other companies for the development  regulatory approval  manufacturing and marketing of new products 
for example  during  hospira entered into collaboration agreements relating to the long term development and commercialization of biosimilar products  which hospira views as an important long term opportunity for its specialty injectable pharmaceutical product line 
hospira s ability to benefit from these arrangements will depend on its ability to successfully manage these arrangements and the performance of the other parties to these arrangements 
hospira and the other parties to these arrangements may not efficiently work together  leading to higher than anticipated costs and or delays in important activities under the arrangements 
the other parties to these arrangements may not devote the resources that hospira requires for the arrangement to be successful 
these arrangements are often governed by complex agreements that may be subject to differing interpretations by the parties  which may result in disputes 
these factors are often beyond the control of hospira  and could harm hospira s sales  product development efforts and profitability 
hospira is subject to the cost containment efforts of hospital buying groups  wholesalers  distributors  third party payors and government organizations 
many existing and potential customers for hospira s products have combined to form gpos  and integrated delivery networks idns in an effort to lower costs 
gpos and idns negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors  and these negotiated prices are made available to a gpo s or an idn s affiliated hospitals and other members 
failure to negotiate advantageous pricing and purchasing arrangements could cause hospira to lose market share to its competitors and or have a material adverse effect on its sales and profitability 
hospira also relies significantly on drug wholesalers to assist in the distribution of its generic injectable pharmaceutical products 
in general  drug wholesalers have been attempting to implement  and unilaterally enforce  a fee for service model for the distribution of such products 
one drug wholesaler continues to unilaterally invoice hospira for higher fees that it alleges are due for the distribution of hospira s generic injectable pharmaceutical products  which hospira denies are payable 
while hospira has contracts in place with its major drug wholesalers  if hospira is required to pay fees not contemplated by its existing agreements  hospira will incur additional costs to distribute its products  which may harm hospira s profitability 
hospira s products and services are sold to hospitals and alternate site providers  such as clinics  home healthcare providers and long term care facilities  all of which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from third party payors  such as government programs  private insurance plans and managed care programs 
these third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services 
levels of reimbursement  if any  may be decreased in the future  and future legislation  regulation or reimbursement policies of third party payors may otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of hospira s products  which could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profitability 
in markets outside the united states  hospira s business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing as a result of the concentrated buying power of governments as principal customers and the use of bid and tender sales methods whereby hospira is required to submit a bid for the sale of its products 
hospira s failure to offer acceptable prices to these customers could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profitability in these markets 
if hospira is unable to maintain its gpo pricing agreements  sales of its products could decline 
a small number of gpos influence a majority of sales to hospira s hospital customers 
gpos negotiate pricing agreements with providers of medical products  and these negotiated prices are made available to members of gpos 
if hospira does not have a pricing agreement with a gpo  it may be more difficult for hospira to sell its products to the gpo s members 
hospira has pricing agreements covering certain products with the major gpos in the united states  including amerinet  inc  broadlane healthcare corporation  consorta  inc  healthtrust purchasing group  medassets inc  novation  llc  pact  llc  and premier purchasing partners  lp 
it will be important for hospira to continue to maintain pricing arrangements with major gpos 
in order to maintain these relationships  hospira must offer a reliable supply of high quality  regulatory compliant products 
hospira also needs to maintain a broad product line and be price competitive 
several gpo contracts are up for renewal or extension each year 
if hospira is unable to renew or extend one or more of those contracts  and cannot replace lost business  hospira s sales and profitability will decline 
there has been consolidation among major gpos  and further consolidation may occur 
the effect of consolidation is uncertain  and consolidation may impair hospira s ability to contract with gpos in the future 
the gpos also have a variety of business relationships with hospira s competitors and may decide to enter into pricing agreements for  or otherwise prefer  products other than hospira s 
while gpos negotiate incentives for members to purchase specified products from a given manufacturer or distributor  gpo pricing agreements allow customers to choose between the products covered by the arrangement and another manufacturer s products  whether or not purchased under a negotiated pricing agreement 
as a result  hospira may face competition for its products even within the context of its gpo pricing agreements 
although some of hospira s gpo pricing agreements may not be terminated without breach until the end of their contracted term  others may be terminated on or days notice 
if hospira is unable to establish or maintain arrangements with key gpos and customers  or if gpo members alter their preference for hospira s products in favor of those of hospira s competitors  hospira s sales and profitability could decline 
hospira and its suppliers and customers are subject to various governmental regulations  and it could be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 
hospira s products are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda  and numerous other national  supranational  federal and state governmental authorities 
the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug or medical device  particularly from the fda and certain governmental authorities outside the united states  can be costly and time consuming  and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis  if at all 
the fda recently has been experiencing a backlog of generic drug applications  which may delay approvals of new generic drug products 
fda officials are considering plans to propose user fees in connection with applications by generic drug producers like hospira for approval of new generic drug products 
if enacted  user fees would increase hospira s product development costs 
existing regulations may also delay or prevent generic drug producers such as hospira from offering certain products  such as biosimilar products  in key territories  which could harm hospira s ability to grow its business 
if a clear regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilar products is not fully developed in the united states and other jurisdictions  hospira may not be able to generate future sales of such products in those jurisdictions and may not realize the anticipated benefits of its investments in the development  manufacture and sale of such products 
delays in receipt of  or failure to obtain  approvals for product candidates could result in delayed realization of product revenues and in substantial additional costs 
hospira may not be able to remain in compliance with applicable fda and other material regulatory requirements once it has obtained clearance or approval for a product 
these requirements include  among other things  regulations regarding manufacturing practices  product labeling  advertising and postmarketing reporting  including adverse event reports and field alerts  some of which are related to manufacturing quality concerns 
hospira may be required by regulatory authorities  or determine on its own  to temporarily cease production and sale of certain products to resolve manufacturing and product quality concerns  which would harm hospira s sales  margins and profitability in the affected period s and may have a material adverse effect on hospira s business 
many of hospira s facilities and procedures and those of its suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation  including periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
for example  manufacturers of pharmaceutical products must comply with detailed regulations governing current good manufacturing practices  including requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance 
hospira must incur expense and spend time and effort in the areas of production  safety  quality control and quality assurance to ensure compliance with these complex regulations 
in the past  hospira s business has received notices alleging violations of these regulations  and hospira has modified its practices in response to these notices 
hospira s manufacturing facilities and those of its suppliers could be subject to significant adverse regulatory actions in the future 
these possible regulatory actions could include warning letters  fines  damages  injunctions  civil penalties  recalls  seizures of its products and criminal prosecution 
these actions could result in  among other things  substantial modifications to hospira s business practices and operations  refunds  recalls or seizures of its products  a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of its facilities while hospira remedies the alleged violation  the inability to obtain future pre market clearances or approvals  and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market 
any adverse regulatory action  or action taken by hospira to maintain appropriate regulatory compliance  could disrupt hospira s business and have a material adverse effect on its sales  profitability and financial condition 
furthermore  adverse regulatory action with respect to any hospira product  operating procedure or manufacturing facility could materially harm hospira s reputation in the marketplace 
the manufacture of hospira s products is highly exacting and complex  and if hospira or its suppliers encounter problems manufacturing  storing or distributing products  hospira s business could suffer 
the manufacture of hospira s products is highly exacting and complex  due in part to strict regulatory requirements governing the manufacture of drugs and medical devices 
problems may arise during manufacturing  storage or distribution of hospira s products for a variety of reasons  including equipment malfunction  failure to follow specific protocols and procedures  problems with raw materials and environmental factors 
if problems arise during the production  storage or distribution of a batch of product  that batch of product may have to be discarded 
this could  among other things  lead to increased costs  lost sales  damage to customer relations  time and expense spent investigating the cause and  depending on the cause  similar losses with respect to other batches or products 
if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market  recall and product liability costs may also be incurred 
problems with respect to the manufacture  storage or distribution of its products could materially disrupt hospira s business and harm its sales and profitability 
hospira is experiencing higher costs to produce its products as a result of rising oil and gas prices 
hospira uses resins and other petroleum based materials as raw materials in many of its products 
prices of oil and gas also affect significantly hospira s costs for freight and utilities 
oil and gas prices are volatile and fluctuated significantly in and  and resulted in higher costs to hospira to produce and distribute its products during certain periods 
if costs increase and hospira is unable to fully recover these costs through price increases or offset these increases through other cost reductions  hospira could experience lower margins and profitability 
hospira depends on third parties to supply raw materials and other components and may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials  which could limit hospira s ability to manufacture products on a timely basis and could harm its profitability 
the manufacture of hospira s products requires raw materials and other components that must meet stringent fda and other regulatory requirements 
some of these raw materials and other components are currently available from a limited number of suppliers 
for example  the lifeshield clave and microclave connector products  which are components of administration sets that represented approximately of hospira s sales  rely on proprietary components that are available exclusively from icu medical 
clave and microclave are registered trademarks of icu medical 
in addition  hospira purchases from single sources certain compounding material  polyvinyl chloride resin and laminate film components for hospira s production of certain flexible bags that it uses with its intravenous and pre mixed solutions  as well as rubber components that it uses with some of its injectable pharmaceuticals 
hospira also obtains from single sources certain active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished products 
identifying alternative suppliers and obtaining approval to change or substitute a raw material or component  or the supplier of a finished product  raw material or component  can be time consuming and expensive  as testing  validation and regulatory approval are necessary 
in the past  hospira s business has experienced shortages in some of the raw materials and components of its products 
continuous supply of petroleum based products is especially risky due to the limited number of capable suppliers  limited production capacity and the effect of natural disasters 
if suppliers are unable to deliver sufficient quantities of these materials on a timely basis or if supply is otherwise disrupted  including by suppliers exiting the market  the manufacture and sale of hospira s products may be disrupted  and its sales and profitability could be materially adversely affected 
hospira s cost reduction activities have resulted in significant charges and cash expenditures 
these activities may disrupt hospira s business and may not result in the intended cost savings 
hospira s strategy  in part  relies on the establishment of a low cost operating infrastructure 
in order to realize potential savings on future manufacturing and other operating costs  since  hospira has taken various actions to dispose of  or close  certain manufacturing facilities 
these actions included the sale of its salt lake city manufacturing facility to icu medical and an agreement to purchase critical care products produced there from icu medical  the closure of its donegal  ireland facility  the planned closures of its ashland  ohio and montreal  canada manufacturing facilities  and the planned accelerated production phase out at its north chicago  illinois manufacturing facility  which is leased from abbott 
these actions have resulted in  and are expected to continue to result in  significant charges to hospira s income and cash expenditures 
future cost reduction activities  if taken  may result in additional charges and cash expenditures  which may be material 
hospira expects to relocate some of the production at the affected facilities to other hospira facilities 
relocation of production to other facilities is a complex process requiring  among other things  re registration of products and modification of the other facilities to accommodate the production 
if hospira does not successfully manage such relocation  its manufacturing operations and business could be disrupted and it may incur more costs than anticipated in connection with these activities 
manufacturing at other hospira facilities  or outsourcing manufacturing to third parties  may not result in the cost savings that hospira expects 
if hospira does not realize expected savings from its cost reduction efforts  its profitability may be harmed 
hospira s manufacturing capacity could limit its ability to expand its business without significant capital investment 
although hospira believes that it has adequate manufacturing capacity for its primary products  it may need to invest substantial capital resources to expand its manufacturing capacity if demand for its products increases significantly or if it is successful in obtaining significant additional customers for its injectable pharmaceuticals contract manufacturing services business 
hospira may not be able to complete any such expansion projects in a timely manner or on a cost effective basis  and may not realize the desired benefits of any such expansion 
as a result of cost reduction efforts  hospira has announced the planned closing of  or has sold  certain of its facilities 
while hospira believes it will have available manufacturing capacity to absorb  or the ability to outsource  the production at these facilities  there may be less available capacity at hospira s facilities 
if hospira experiences an interruption in manufacturing at any of its primary manufacturing facilities  it may not be able to produce sufficient products for its customers 
as a result  hospira s sales  margins and profitability may be materially harmed 
hospira relies on the performance of its information technology systems  the failure of which could have an adverse effect on hospira s business and performance 
hospira operates in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure 
these systems are vulnerable to interruption by fire  power loss  system malfunction and other such events  which are beyond hospira s control 
systems interruptions could reduce hospira s ability to manufacture its products  and could have a material adverse effect on hospira s operations and financial performance 
integration of hospira s systems with mayne pharma s systems may increase the chance of systems interruptions 
the level of hospira s protection and disaster recovery capability varies from site to site  and there can be no guarantee that any such plans  to the extent they are in place  will be totally effective 
hospira may continue to acquire other businesses  license rights to technologies or products from third parties  or form alliances  which may not be successful 
as part of hospira s business strategy  it may continue to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses and technology licensing arrangements 
hospira also may pursue strategic alliances to expand its product offerings and geographic presence 
hospira may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner  on a cost effective basis or at all  and may not realize the expected benefits of any acquisition  license arrangement or strategic alliance 
other companies  including those with substantially greater financial and sales and marketing resources  may compete with hospira for these strategic opportunities 
further  if hospira is successful in securing such opportunities  the products and technologies that hospira acquires may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated 
in addition  hospira may enter markets in which it has no or limited prior experience 
hospira conducts sales activity outside of the united states and is subject to additional business risks that may cause its sales and profitability to decline 
because hospira s products are sold outside the united states  its business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
in  hospira s business derived million  or of its net sales  from sales of products outside of the united states 
with the acquisition of mayne pharma  which derives a substantial majority of its revenues outside the united states  a significantly higher percentage of sales will be generated outside the united states in and beyond 
hospira may continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales of products outside the united states  which could expose hospira to greater risks 
the risks associated with hospira s operations outside the united states include changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs  multiple regulatory requirements that are subject to change  which may delay or deter hospira s international product commercialization efforts  differing local product preferences and product requirements  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  difficulty in establishing  staffing and managing international operations  differing labor regulations  complying with us regulations that apply to international operations  including trade laws  the foreign corrupt practices act and anti boycott laws  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws  political and economic instability  and diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the united states 
hospira operates through distributors in many countries outside the united states 
its success will depend on the efforts and performance of such distributors  which is beyond hospira s control 
the acquisition of mayne pharma will increase the dependence of the international business on the performance of distributors 
these risks could have a material adverse effect on hospira s ability to distribute and sell its products in markets outside the united states and on hospira s profitability 
hospira is subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulations that could result in significant liability and require hospira to change its business practices and restrict its operations in the future 
hospira s industry is subject to various national  supranational  federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse  including anti kickback and false claims laws 
violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and or civil sanctions  including  in some instances  substantial fines  imprisonment and exclusion from participation in national  federal and state healthcare programs  including medicare  medicaid  and veterans administration health programs and health programs outside the united states 
these laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretations  which could require hospira to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices 
in addition  violations of these laws  or allegations of such violations  could disrupt hospira s business and result in a material adverse effect on hospira s sales  profitability and financial condition 
state and federal investigations and existing and future lawsuits relating to the alleged reporting of false or misleading pricing information in connection with medicare and medicaid programs could have a material adverse effect on hospira s business  profitability and financial condition 
various state and federal agencies  including the us department of justice and various state attorneys general  are investigating a number of pharmaceutical companies  including abbott  for allegedly engaging in improper marketing and pricing practices with respect to certain medicare and medicaid reimbursable products  including practices relating to average wholesale price awp 
these are civil investigations that are seeking to identify the practices and determine whether those practices violated any laws  including federal and state false claims acts  or constituted fraud in connection with the medicare and or medicaid reimbursement paid to third parties 
in addition  abbott is a defendant in a number of purported class actions on behalf of individuals or entities  including healthcare insurers and other third party payors  that allege generally that abbott and numerous other pharmaceutical companies reported false or misleading pricing information in connection with federal  state and private reimbursement for certain drugs 
since the spin off  hospira has been named as a defendant in some of these suits  as further described in item legal proceedings marketing and pricing cases 
hospira s products are involved in these investigations and lawsuits 
there may be additional investigations or lawsuits  or additional claims in existing investigations or lawsuits  initiated with respect to these matters in the future 
hospira may be named as a subject or defendant in more of these investigations or lawsuits 
abbott will indemnify hospira for liabilities associated with pending or future awp investigations and lawsuits only to the extent that they are of the same nature as the lawsuits and investigations that existed against abbott as of the spin off date and relate to the sale of hospira products prior to the spin off 
hospira will assume any other losses that may result from these investigations and lawsuits related to hospira s products 
hospira has not established any reserves related to these matters  and hospira does not currently believe insurance coverage will be available for any resulting losses 
these investigations and lawsuits could result in changes to hospira s business practices or pricing policies  civil or criminal monetary damages  penalties or fines  imprisonment and or exclusion of hospira s products from participation in federal and state healthcare programs  including medicare  medicaid and veterans administration health programs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on hospira s business  profitability and financial condition 
income taxes can have an unpredictable effect on hospira s results of operations and result in greater than anticipated liabilities 
hospira is subject to income taxes in a variety of jurisdictions  and its tax structure is subject to review by both domestic and foreign taxation authorities 
because hospira s income tax expense for any period depends heavily on the mix of income derived from the various taxing jurisdictions during that period  which is inherently uncertain  its income tax expense and reported net income may fluctuate significantly  and may be materially different than forecasted 
hospira is the beneficiary of tax exemptions in certain jurisdictions outside the united states  where a portion of its income is sourced 
these tax exemptions have a significant impact on reducing hospira s overall effective tax rate 
if hospira is unable to maintain these tax exemptions  hospira s future profitability may be reduced 
changes in laws or governmental policies can affect the availability of these exemptions 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and in evaluating tax positions that are subject to audits and adjustments 
reserves are established when  despite hospira s belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  positions taken by hospira are likely to be challenged based on the applicable tax authority s determination of the positions 
although hospira believes its tax provisions and reserves are reasonable  the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in its financial statements and may materially affect its financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 
hospira may incur product liability losses and insurance coverage could be inadequate or unavailable to cover these losses 
hospira s business is subject to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design  development  manufacture and marketing of drugs and medical devices and products 
in the ordinary course of business  hospira is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to patients 
product liability claims and lawsuits  safety alerts or product recalls  regardless of their ultimate outcome  could have a material adverse effect on hospira s business and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers 
hospira is responsible for all liabilities  including liabilities for claims and lawsuits  related to its business  whether they arose before or after the spin off  other than certain liabilities relating to allegations that it engaged in improper marketing and pricing practices in connection with federal  state or private reimbursement for its products 
as part of hospira s risk management policy  hospira carries third party product liability insurance coverage  which includes a substantial retention or deductible that provides that hospira will not receive insurance proceeds until the losses incurred exceed the amount of that retention or deductible 
to the extent that any losses are within these retentions or deductibles  hospira will be responsible for the administration and payment of these losses 
product liability claims in excess of applicable insurance could have a material adverse effect on hospira s profitability and financial condition 
if hospira is unable to protect its intellectual property rights  its business and prospects could be harmed 
hospira relies on trade secrets  confidentiality agreements  continuing technological innovation and  in some cases  patent  trademark and service mark protection to preserve its competitive position 
a failure to protect hospira s intellectual property could harm its business and prospects  and its efforts to protect its proprietary rights may not be adequate 
most of hospira s products are not protected by patents or other proprietary rights  and have limited or no market exclusivity 
patent filings by third parties could render hospira s intellectual property less valuable 
in addition  intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in certain countries outside the united states  which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position 
competitors may also harm sales of hospira s products by designing products that mirror the capabilities of those products or technology without infringing hospira s intellectual property rights 
if hospira does not obtain sufficient international protection for its intellectual property  hospira s competitiveness in international markets could be impaired  which could limit its growth and future sales 
if hospira infringes the intellectual property rights of third parties  hospira may face legal action  increased costs and delays in marketing new products 
hospira seeks to launch generic pharmaceutical products either where patent protection of equivalent branded products has expired  where patents have been declared invalid or where products do not infringe the patents of others 
to achieve a first to market position for generic pharmaceutical products  hospira may take action  such as litigation  to seek to assert that its products do not infringe patents of existing products or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable 
these actions may result in increased litigation  which could be costly and time consuming  and which may not be successful 
hospira and mayne pharma have made abbreviated new drug applications and certifications known as paragraph iv certifications that the relevant patents for existing products would not be infringed by a hospira or mayne pharma product  or were invalid or enforceable  in the united states and equivalent filings in canada 
claims filed by innovators challenging these paragraph iv certifications may delay or prevent the launch of the relevant products and result in additional costs 
third parties may claim that hospira s products are infringing their intellectual property rights 
claims of intellectual property infringement could be costly and time consuming and might require hospira to enter into costly royalty or license agreements  if hospira is able to obtain royalty or license agreements on acceptable terms or at all 
hospira also may be subject to significant damages or an injunction preventing it from manufacturing  selling or using some of its products in the event of a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement 
any of these adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on hospira s profitability and financial condition 
hospira has outstanding stock options  which may dilute the ownership of its existing shareholders 
as of december   hospira had approximately million outstanding stock options and the ability to award approximately million additional share based awards under its equity compensation plan 
as of december   hospira s outstanding option awards had a weighted average exercise price of  which was below the market price of hospira s stock at that time 
exercises of stock options at a price below the market price of hospira s stock will dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders

item legal proceedings in addition to the litigation described below  additional legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in estimated reserves recorded by hospira 
it is not possible to predict the outcome of legal proceedings with certainty and their ultimate disposition may have a material adverse effect on hospira s financial position  cash flows  or results of operations 
marketing and pricing cases various state and federal agencies  including the us department of justice and various state attorneys general  are investigating a number of pharmaceutical companies  including abbott  for allegedly engaging in improper marketing and pricing practices with respect to certain medicare and medicaid reimbursable products  including practices relating to average wholesale price awp

transition from abbott hospira became a separate public company on april   when it was spun off from abbott 
references to the historical assets  liabilities  products  businesses or activities of hospira prior to the spin off are generally intended to refer to the historical assets  liabilities  products  businesses or activities of hospira s business as it was conducted as part of abbott prior to the spin off 
hospira s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  reflect hospira s operations as a separate  stand alone entity subsequent to the spin off  combined with the historical operations of hospira when it operated as part of abbott prior to the spin off 
the financial information in the financial statements included in this annual report does not include all the expenses that would have been incurred  nor does it reflect hospira s results of operations  financial position and cash flows  had hospira been a stand alone company for all of the two year period after the spin off was a transition period during which hospira built its own corporate and international infrastructure and completed its separation from abbott 
from to  hospira incurred increased expenses year over year as a result of establishing and operating independent corporate functions  operating  maintaining and supporting information technology systems  and operating internationally on a stand alone basis 
from to  hospira also incurred expenses on a non recurring  transitional basis as a result of the spin off  including expenses relating to the establishment of new facilities  the build out of independent information technology systems  and product registration and re labeling 
hospira incurred million of these costs in  million in and million in hospira does not expect to incur these non recurring  transitional expenses in future periods 
under the terms of the spin off  the legal title to certain assets and operations relating to hospira s business outside the united states were transferred from abbott over the two year period after the spin off 
these transfers were completed during hospira paid million in and million in to acquire these assets 
these transfers were completed during  and hospira has no further related obligations to abbott going forward 
hospira and abbott entered into various manufacture and supply agreements prior to the spin off under which hospira supplied certain products to abbott that it manufactured prior to the spin off 
these agreements had an initial two year term originally scheduled to expire in april  subject to being extended by abbott for an additional two year term under substantially similar contractual provisions 
some of these agreements terminated in  resulting in lower sales to abbott during sales to abbott are expected to continue to decline in cost reduction activities as part of its strategy to improve margins and cash flows  beginning in  hospira has taken a number of actions to reduce operating costs and optimize its manufacturing capabilities and capacity 
expenditures relating to these activities are not included in the transition activities discussed above 
in may  to reduce its costs to produce critical care products  hospira completed a strategic manufacturing  commercialization and development agreement with icu medical and sold its salt lake city manufacturing facility and related equipment and inventory to icu medical 
in connection with these transactions  during  hospira recorded an impairment charge of million and a loss of million  which was hospira s best estimate of the cost of certain obligations that hospira was required to reimburse to icu medical over the month period after closing 
both the impairment and the loss related to obligations assumed were recorded in cost of products sold 
during  hospira reduced its liability by million due to a change in icu medical s strategy for the manufacturing facility that reduced hospira s related obligation 
for further details regarding the financial impact of these transactions  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item in august  hospira announced plans to close its medical device manufacturing plant in donegal  ireland 
hospira closed the facility late in products produced at the donegal plant have been moved to hospira facilities primarily in costa rica and the dominican republic 
at the time of the announcement  hospira expected to incur million to million of pre tax charges relating to the plant closure 
during and  hospira incurred million and million of these charges  respectively  which are reported in cost of products sold 
the costs consist primarily of severance and other employee benefit costs  additional depreciation resulting from the decreased useful lives of the building and certain equipment  and other exit costs 
hospira expects to generate cost savings relating to this activity beginning in for further details regarding the financial impact of this plant closure  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item in february  hospira announced plans to close its plants in ashland  ohio and montreal  canada over the subsequent to months  respectively  and also provided a timeline for phasing out production at a facility in abbott laboratories north chicago  illinois campus  where it has leased space from its former parent company since the spin off in april hospira intends to transition out of this facility in advance of the lease s expiration in  with a majority of the product transfers occurring over the four years following the announcement 
hospira will transfer production of the primary products from these facilities to other hospira facilities and will outsource certain product components to third party suppliers 
the aggregate charges that hospira will incur related to the plant closings are expected to be in the range of approximately million to million on a pre tax basis  of which approximately million to million are expected to be reported as restructuring charges 
the restructuring costs consist primarily of costs related to severance and other employee benefit costs  additional depreciation resulting from the decreased useful lives of the buildings and certain equipment  and other exit costs 
the remaining charges relate to the relocation of production 
during  hospira incurred million of restructuring charges  which are recorded in cost of products sold 
for further details regarding the financial impact of this plant closure  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item these cost reduction activities involve risks and uncertainties as relocating or outsourcing production is a complex process 
hospira may incur more charges than estimated and may not realize the expected cost savings on its planned time frame or at all 
see item a 
risk factors risks relating to hospira s business and industry hospira s cost reduction activities have resulted in significant charges 
these activities may disrupt hospira s business and may not result in the intended cost savings 
acquisition of mayne pharma limited on february   hospira acquired mayne pharma limited mayne pharma  an australia based specialty injectable pharmaceutical company listed on the australian stock exchange  for approximately billion in cash 
as mayne pharma has strong market positions in europe and australia and a significant commercial infrastructure outside the united states  the acquisition is expected to substantially increase hospira s international presence 
the acquisition is also expected to broaden hospira s specialty injectable pharmaceuticals product line 
the results of operations of mayne pharma will be included in hospira s results for periods on and after february  in connection with the closing of the acquisition  in  hospira will incur non cash charges relating to purchase accounting  including a write off of in process research and development and a write up of inventory 
hospira will also record intangible assets which will be amortized over their useful lives 
for the two year period following the closing  hospira expects to incur approximately million to million of costs relating to the integration of mayne pharma  the substantial majority of which will be in cash 
hospira borrowed approximately billion under a one year bridge loan facility and a three year term loan facility  and used approximately million of cash on hand  to finance the acquisition  and as of the closing  had approximately billion of total debt 
hospira expects to refinance the borrowings under the bridge loan through the sale of long term debt securities during on an ongoing basis  hospira will incur significantly greater interest expense than it incurred in prior periods  and will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow to servicing its debt 
please refer to liquidity and capital resources debt and capital later in this item for further details 
the acquisition of mayne pharma is subject to various risks and uncertainties  including risks relating to the integration of mayne pharma and risks relating to our incurring substantial indebtedness in connection with the acquisition and the need to refinance the indebtedness 
please see item a 
risk factors risks relating to the mayne pharma acquisition and related transactions 
other factors manufacturing and quality 
hospira s ability to manufacture and sell high quality  low cost products in compliance with regulatory requirements is an important factor to the success of its business 
hospira must comply with regulations governing the design  manufacture  marketing and sale of its products  including requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance  and must incur expense  time and effort to ensure compliance with the complex regulations 
hospira must also maintain continuity of supply of raw materials that comply with applicable regulatory requirements 
its business is subject to risks of manufacturing and supply interruptions  and product quality issues  which can lead to product recalls or field actions 
hospira did not experience significant manufacturing or raw material supply interruptions during the periods presented in this report 
hospira has recalled  and or conducted field alerts relating to  certain of its products from time to time 
while these activities can lead to costs to repair or replace affected products and temporary interruptions in product sales  and can impact reported results of operations in the applicable period  hospira does not believe that these activities had a material adverse effect on its business or results of operations during the periods presented in this report 
product development 
hospira views investment in research and development as an important driver of sales growth over the longer term 
to successfully execute its product development strategy  hospira must continue to develop cost competitive products and enhancements that satisfy customer needs  introduce products on a timely basis and successfully market those products 
as a part of this strategy  hospira will also need to identify  and successfully manage  strategic alliances and collaborative arrangements 
hospira believes that the ability to grow sales in the specialty injectable pharmaceutical product line will be driven primarily by its ability to launch new generic drug products on a timely basis 
generally  the price and sales volume of a generic drug tend to decline as more competitors enter the market for that particular drug 
however  new product launches can offset declines from other portfolio products and generate growth 
if a company can be first to market  such that the branded drug is the only other competition for a period of time  higher levels of sales and profitability can be achieved 
timely  efficient research and development capabilities and expertise in legal and regulatory matters will be required to be successful in executing a first to market strategy 
over the longer term  hospira views biosimilar products as an important opportunity 
in  hospira invested in biosimilar product development through its collaboration with stada  under which it made a million upfront payment  and its million acquisition of bresagen limited 
a key component to the product development strategy for medication management systems has been the development and offering of newer technology drug delivery pumps and related products and services 
hospira expects to achieve sales growth in part due to increased sales of these newer technology products 
hospira believes that the features and functionality offered by these products position it to achieve such growth over the long term 
as a result  hospira is aggressively competing to upgrade its current customer base as well as to capture competitive business 
because of changes in technology  it may take more time and effort to sell and implement newer technology products to its customers 
hospira also expects intense competition for existing and potential customers from other competitors 
the timing and amount of purchases made by customers cannot be predicted with certainty 
hospira s ability to execute on its product development efforts is subject to various risks and uncertainties described in item a 
risk factors  including the ability to timely launch new products and enhancements  the ability to successfully manage collaborative arrangements  actions of competitors and acceptance by customers 
contract manufacturing 
hospira s contract manufacturing product line has received lower forecasted volumes from existing customers 
in addition  certain drugs being manufactured by hospira under contract have lost patent protection  which results in lower demand for hospira s contract manufacturing services 
these factors are expected to negatively impact hospira s contract manufacturing product line sales by approximately million 
hospira expects to offset a small portion of this loss through new contracts or volume under other contracts  and expects substantially lower contract manufacturing sales during gpo contracts 
the ability to maintain gpo contracts is an important factor for hospira to generate sales 
approximately of hospira s net sales are made through these contracts 
typically  these contracts cover a portion of hospira s product lines  specify the prices for hospira s products  and are effective for three to five years 
generally  the contracts are extended or competitively bid prior to contract expiration 
in any year  a portion of the various contracts hospira has with gpo s expire 
while hospira expects to maintain its business with the gpo s and has been able to maintain its base business under its gpo contracts during the periods covered by this report  if hospira is unable to renew or renegotiate any significant gpo contracts in the future  its ability to sell products and its profitability may be harmed 
share repurchase 
in february  hospira s board of directors approved a million share repurchase program 
as of december   hospira purchased  shares for million 
because hospira must dedicate a substantial portion of its cash to servicing debt and integrating mayne pharma into its operations  hospira does not expect to continue repurchasing shares for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
critical accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
hospira believes its most critical accounting policies are those described below 
for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition hospira recognizes revenues from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for other than certain drug delivery pumps and injectable pharmaceutical contract manufacturing  product revenue is recognized when products are delivered to customers and title passes 
in certain circumstances  hospira enters into arrangements in which it provides multiple elements to its customers 
in these cases  total revenue is divided among the separate units of accounting deliverables based on their relative fair value and is recognized for each deliverable in accordance with the applicable revenue recognition criteria 
the recognition of revenue is delayed if there are significant post delivery obligations  such as installation or customer acceptance 
for drug delivery pumps  revenue is typically derived under one of three types of arrangements outright sales of the drug delivery pump  placements under lease arrangements  and placements under contracts that include associated disposable set purchases 
for lease agreements under which hospira s warranty obligation extends through the entire term are accounted for as operating leases 
for these  hospira recognizes revenue over the lease term  which averages five years 
for leases under which hospira s warranty obligation is limited to approximately one year  hospira accounts for these as sales type leases  under which the discounted sales value of the drug delivery pump is recorded as revenue upon placement with the customer 
hospira has contractual arrangements with certain customers whereby it places drug delivery pumps at customer sites  and the customers agree to purchase minimum levels of disposable products sets that are used with the pumps 
these arrangements do not include any upfront fees or payments 
the contractual arrangements generally set forth fixed prices for the purchases of the disposable products  where the prices for the disposables do not change over the term of the arrangement  other than  in some cases  for changes in consumer price index provisions 
title for the pumps is retained by hospira throughout these arrangements  and the related asset is depreciated over its estimated useful life on a straight line basis 
in these placement arrangements  revenue is recognized as the disposable products are delivered  in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  and sab no 
 revenue recognition 
hospira markets a server based suite of software applications designed to connect data from a hospital s drug information library to drug delivery pumps throughout the hospital 
the arrangements related to such applications typically include a perpetual software license  software maintenance and implementation services 
hospira recognizes revenue related to these arrangements in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
software license revenue and implementation service revenue are generally recognized upon completion of related obligations or customer acceptance and software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period 
injectable pharmaceutical contract manufacturing involves filling customers active pharmaceutical ingredients api into delivery systems 
under these arrangements  customers api is often consigned to hospira and revenue is recorded for the materials and labor provided by hospira  plus a profit  upon shipment to the customer 
upon recognizing revenue from a sale  hospira records an estimate for certain items that reduce gross sales in arriving at its reported net sales for each period 
these items include chargebacks  rebates and other items such as cash discounts and returns 
provisions for chargebacks and rebates represent the most significant and complex of these estimates 
chargebacks hospira sells a significant portion of its specialty injectable pharmaceutical products through wholesalers  which maintain inventories of hospira products and later sell those products to end customers 
in connection with its sales and marketing efforts  hospira negotiates prices with end customers for certain products under pricing agreements including  for example  group purchasing organization contracts 
consistent with industry practice  the negotiated end customer prices are typically lower than the prices charged to the wholesalers 
when an end customer purchases a hospira product that is covered by a pricing agreement from a wholesaler  the end customer pays the wholesaler the price determined under the pricing agreement 
the wholesaler is then entitled to charge hospira back for the difference between the price the wholesaler paid hospira and the contract price paid by the end customer a chargeback 
this process is necessary to enable hospira to track actual sales to the end customer  which is essential information to run the business effectively 
settlement of chargebacks generally occurs between and days after the sale to wholesalers 
to account for the chargeback  hospira records the initial sale to a wholesaler at the price invoiced to the wholesaler and at the same time  records a provision equal to the estimated amount the wholesaler will later charge back to hospira  reducing gross sales and trade receivables 
this provision must be estimated because the actual end customer and applicable pricing terms may vary at the time of the sale to the wholesaler 
accordingly  the most significant estimates inherent in the initial chargeback provision relate to the volume of sales to the wholesalers that will be subject to chargeback and the ultimate end customer contract price 
these estimates are based primarily on an analysis of hospira s product sales and most recent historical average chargeback credits by product  estimated wholesaler inventory levels  current contract pricing  anticipated future contract pricing changes and claims processing lag time 
hospira estimates the levels of inventory at the wholesalers through analysis of wholesaler purchases and inventory data obtained directly from certain of the wholesalers 
a one percent decrease in end customer contract prices for sales pending chargeback at december  would decrease net sales and income before income taxes by million 
a one percent increase in wholesale units sold subject to chargebacks at december  would decrease net sales and income before income taxes by million 
hospira regularly monitors the provision for chargebacks and makes adjustments when it believes the actual chargebacks may differ from estimates 
at december  and  chargebacks of million and million  respectively  were recorded as a reduction in trade receivables 
the methodology used to estimate and provide for chargebacks was consistent across all periods presented 
rebates hospira primarily offers rebates to direct customers  customers who purchase from certain wholesalers at end customer contract prices and government agencies  which administer various programs such as medicaid 
direct rebates are generally rebates paid to direct purchasing customers based on a contracted discount applied to the direct customer s purchases 
indirect rebates are rebates paid to indirect customers that have purchased hospira products from a wholesaler under a pricing agreement with hospira 
governmental agency rebates are amounts owed based on legal requirements with public sector benefit providers such as medicaid  after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant 
rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases 
hospira estimates the amount of the rebate due at the time of sale  and records the liability and a reduction of gross sales at the same time the product sale is recorded 
settlement of the rebate generally occurs from three to months after sale 
in determining provisions for rebates to direct customers  hospira considers the volume of eligible purchases by these customers and the rebate terms 
in determining rebates on sales through wholesalers  hospira considers the volume of eligible contract purchases  the rebate terms and the estimated level of inventory at the wholesalers that would be subject to a rebate  which is estimated as described above under chargebacks 
upon receipt of a chargeback  due to the availability of product and customer specific information  hospira can then establish a specific provision for fees or rebates based on the specific terms of each agreement 
rebates under governmental programs are based on the estimated volume of products sold subject to these programs 
each period the estimates are reviewed and revised  if necessary  in conjunction with a review of contract volumes within the period 
adjustments related to prior period sales have not been material in any period 
hospira regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to recorded reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs 
at december  and  accrued rebates of million and million  respectively  are included in other accrued liabilities 
the methodology used to estimate and provide for rebates was consistent across all periods presented 
the following table is an analysis of chargebacks and rebates for and in each year  the provisions for chargebacks and rebates relating to prior period sales were not material 
wholesaler dollars in thousands chargebacks rebates balance at january  provisions payments balance at december  provisions payments balance at december  stock based compensation on january   hospira adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires  among other changes  that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized as compensation cost over the vesting period based on the fair value of the instrument on the date of grant 
under sfas no 
r  hospira uses the black scholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the fair value model includes various assumptions  including the expected volatility and expected life of the awards 
these assumptions reflect hospira s best estimates  but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of hospira s control 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  stock based compensation expense  as calculated and recorded under sfas no 
r  could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if hospira uses different assumptions in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item for additional information regarding stock based compensation 
pension and post retirement benefits hospira provides pension and post retirement medical and dental benefits to certain of its employees based both in and outside of the united states 
prior to the spin off date  hospira employees participated in abbott benefit plans that provided pension and post retirement benefits 
for financial reporting purposes  hospira develops long term assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  and healthcare cost trend rate 
for these assumptions  management consults with actuaries  monitors plan provisions and demographics  and reviews public market data and general economic information 
the discount rate estimate for the current year is based on a proprietary yield curve developed by third party actuaries  while prior year estimates used moody s aa corporate bond index  with consideration of differences in duration between the bonds in the index and hospira s benefit liabilities 
the change in assumption did not have a significant impact on hospira s consolidated financial statements 
the expected rate of return for the pension plan represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits are expected to be paid 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is developed from the expected future return of each asset class  weighted by the expected allocation of pension assets to that asset class 
hospira considers historical performance for the types of assets in which the plans invest  independent market forecasts  and economic and capital market conditions 
the healthcare cost trend rate for was for pre and for post years of age employees  with both rates declining to by and  respectively 
a one percentage point increase decrease in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate  with other assumptions held constant  would increase decrease the service and interest component of net post retirement medical and dental cost for the year ended december  by approximately million  and would increase decrease the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation by approximately million 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas no 

one provision of sfas no 
requires full recognition of the funded status of hospira s defined benefit and post retirement plans 
the incremental effect of the application of this provision is provided in note of the consolidated financial statements 
another provision of sfas no 
requires the measurement of hospira s defined benefit plan s assets and its obligations to determine the funded status be made as of the end of the fiscal year 
hospira s current measurement date is november this provision of sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after december  hospira is currently evaluating the potential impact of this provision of sfas no 
on its financial statements 
loss contingencies hospira accounts for contingent losses in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

under sfas no 
 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management s best estimate of a loss  or when a best estimate cannot be made  a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded 
these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are refined each accounting period  as additional information is known 
accordingly  if hospira is initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss  the minimum amount  which could be zero  is recorded 
income taxes hospira s provision for income taxes is based on taxable income  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which hospira operates 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and in evaluating tax positions that are subject to audits and adjustments 
reserves are established when  despite hospira s belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  certain positions are likely to be challenged based on the applicable tax authority s determination of the positions 
such reserves are based on management s judgment  utilizing internal and external tax advisors  and represent the best estimate as to the ultimate outcome of tax audits 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of changes to reserves 
each quarter  hospira reviews the anticipated mix of income derived from the various taxing jurisdictions and its reserves in accordance with sfas no 
deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements at the enacted statutory rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid 
provision for income taxes and foreign withholding taxes are not provided for on undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries when hospira intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely to fund foreign acquisitions or to meet working capital and plant and equipment acquisition needs 
see further discussion regarding the impact on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as a result of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act in note to the consolidated financial statements 
prior to the spin off date  the provision for income taxes was calculated on a separate return basis 
under the tax sharing agreement executed in conjunction with the spin off  abbott will indemnify hospira for tax liabilities arising for periods prior to the spin off date 
therefore  no tax liabilities for the periods prior to the spin off are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
prospectively  hospira has been providing for income taxes based on its post separation independent activities 
these estimates might change in future periods as hospira develops its own tax filing history and considers the results of tax authority examinations

excluding berlex  sales within this product line increased  driven by the impact of sales of ceftriaxone  launched in the third quarter of  increased sales of certain anti infective products which hospira believes was partially driven by a competitor s inability to supply product earlier in the year coupled with government orders  increased sales of syringe products  and favorable price 
these factors were partially offset by lower sales of add vantage diluents due to competitive drug supply issues 
the sales increase in medication delivery systems was driven primarily by growth in medication management systems 
the growth in medication management systems was due primarily to increased placements of hospira s newer technology plum a pumps with hospira mednet coupled with the impact of placements of hospira s lifecare pca infusion system  which was launched in the first quarter of sales in injectable pharmaceutical contract manufacturing were up slightly  driven by growth in demand for several existing and new products  partially offset by the impact of the termination of certain lower margin contracts 
the decrease in us sales to abbott was primarily due to decreased demand by abbott for several of its products  partially offset by increased price 
the other product line includes sales of hospira s products to alternate site providers such as clinics  home healthcare providers and long term care facilities  as well as sales of critical care devices and brain function monitoring systems 
the increase in other us sales was primarily due to increased sales to alternate site healthcare customers including higher sales of anesthesia products  including recently introduced propofol  increased sales of pumps and sets  and other adjustments  partially offset by decreased sales of deferoxamine due to a competitive product launch and lower critical care sales 
international sales to third parties were up  primarily reflecting increased sales on a third party manufacturing contract  growth in canada  and favorable exchange  partially offset by reduced volumes due to transition related supply chain disruptions and lower pricing to distributors compared to the prior abbott direct sales model 
international sales to abbott increased primarily due to increased price and increased demand by abbott for several of its products 
compared to sales in specialty injectable pharmaceuticals declined  reflecting the termination of the berlex imaging agents distribution agreement and the impact of increased generic competition on hospira s corlopam product 
sales of the remainder of the specialty injectable pharmaceuticals product line were strong  driven by the impact of sales of products launched in and ceftriaxone  deferoxamine and fluconazole  increased volumes of syringe products  certain anti infectives which hospira believes was partially driven by a competitor s inability to supply product in the third and fourth quarters of  and favorable price 
the sales increase in medication delivery systems was driven by growth in medication management systems  partially offset by a decline in infusion therapy products 
the growth in medication management systems was due to placements of hospira s newer technology plum a pumps with hospira mednet coupled with a higher mix of sales type leases and outright sales versus operating leases 
the decline in infusion therapy product sales was driven by the expiration of a contract under which hospira sold product to a competitor  as well as lower pricing on sets  partially offset by other favorable volume mix 
sales in injectable pharmaceutical contract manufacturing were flat  primarily due to favorable price and growth in demand for several existing supply agreements  offset by the impact of the termination of certain contracts 
the decrease in us sales to abbott was due to the exclusion of the cost of the bulk drug subsequent to the spin off for certain products manufactured for abbott  while through april included the cost of these bulk drugs 
this reflects the post spin off manufacturing arrangement between hospira and abbott  under which abbott transfers the bulk drug to hospira for processing and hospira s sales include only the value added portion plus a markup for these products 
this reduction was partially offset by increased demand by abbott for several of its products and by the markup on products sold to abbott after the spin off 
the increase in other us sales was primarily due to increased sales of products launched in and ceftriaxone and deferoxamine and certain anti infectives which hospira believes was partially driven by a competitor s inability to supply product in the third and fourth quarters of to alternate site healthcare customers  partially offset by a decline in sales of critical care products 
international sales to third parties increased primarily due to favorable foreign exchange rates 
international sales to abbott increased primarily due to volume related to an additional product manufactured for abbott subsequent to the spin off  coupled with the impact of the markup on products sold to abbott after the spin off  partially offset by reduced demand on other products

in connection with the spin off  hospira and abbott agreed that the legal transfer of certain operations and assets net of liabilities outside the united states would occur  and be completed  within two years after the spin off 
during the transition period  these operations and assets were used in the conduct of hospira s international business and hospira was subject to the risks and entitled to the benefits generated by such operations and assets 
hospira was obligated to pay abbott for these operations and assets  and assume the corresponding liabilities  over a two year period after the spin off date as hospira established its business infrastructure outside the united states and obtained regulatory approval for the transfer of the marketing authorizations for hospira products to local hospira affiliates or third party distributors

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk financial instrument and risk management hospira operates globally  and earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
upon consideration of management objectives  costs and opportunities  hospira uses derivative instruments  including foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps to manage these risks 
hospira enters into derivative instrument contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions to limit the amount of credit exposure to nonperformance by any one institution 
hospira does not utilize derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency sensitive financial instruments hospira s operations are exposed to currency exchange rate risk  which is mitigated by hospira s use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward contracts 
the objective in managing exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is to reduce volatility on earnings and cash flows associated with these changes 
currency exposures include third party trade payables and receivables  and intercompany loans where the asset or liability is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity 
forward contract gains and losses on these exposures substantially offset the remeasurement of the related asset or liability and both are included in other income expense  net 
in addition  currency exposures exist for certain subsidiaries for anticipated intercompany purchases  firm commitments  and third party forecasted transactions expected to be denominated in a foreign currency due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
forward contract gains and losses related to such exposures are also included in other income expense  net during the term of the forward contract  as they are not formally designated as hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
net forward contract expense and the carrying value and fair value of forward contracts were not significant in and interest rate sensitive financial instruments hospira s primary interest rate exposures relate to cash and cash equivalents  and fixed and variable rate debt 
the objective in managing exposure to changes in interest rates is to reduce volatility on earnings and cash flows associated with these changes 
hospira s investment portfolio of million at december  consists of cash and cash equivalents  equity investments in affiliated companies  and cost investments  primarily consisting of marketable securities which are classified as available for sale 
for marketable securities  any gains or losses will not be recognized in hospira s statements of income until the investment is sold or if there is a reduction in fair value that is determined to be an other than temporary impairment 
the carrying value of the investment portfolio approximates fair market value at december  and the value at maturity  as the majority of investments consist of securities with maturities of less than three months 
because hospira s investments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents  a hypothetical one percentage point increase decrease in interest rates  based on average cash and cash equivalents during the year  would increase decrease interest income by approximately million 
in conjunction with the spin off from abbott  on june   hospira completed an underwritten offering of a consolidated million aggregate principal amount consisting of million five year senior unsecured notes and million year senior unsecured notes  both of which bear a fixed rate of interest 
in addition  the revolver allows hospira to borrow up to million for working capital and other requirements 
the revolver allows hospira to borrow funds at variable interest rates as short term cash needs dictate 
as of december   hospira had no amounts outstanding under the revolver 
hospira has entered into various loan agreements related to the legal transfer of certain international operations from abbott 
these borrowings are made by hospira s foreign affiliates in their local currency and are used to optimize the capital structure 
as of december  and  hospira had million and million of such loans outstanding  respectively  of which million and million was classified as short term  respectively 
in january  hospira entered into interest rate swap transactions whereby the million five year senior unsecured notes due in june were effectively converted from fixed to floating rate debt 
hospira records the interest rate swap contracts at fair value and offsets the carrying amount of the fixed rate debt by the same amount 
at december  and  these interest rate swaps had an aggregate fair market value of million and million  respectively 
if these derivative instruments had been terminated at december  and  this estimated fair value represents the amount that hospira would have to pay to counterparties 
as a result of converting from fixed to floating rate debt  a hypothetical one percentage point increase decrease in interest rates would increase decrease interest expense by million
