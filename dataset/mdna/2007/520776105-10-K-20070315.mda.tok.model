critical accounting policies the company has disclosed its major accounting policies in note b to the consolidated financial statements 
the following provides supplemental information to these accounting policies as well as information on the accounts requiring more significant estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts methodology the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filings  substantial down grading of credit ratings  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
for all other customers  the company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the company s historical experience of bad debt write offs as a percent of accounts receivable outstanding 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  the estimates of the recoverability of amounts due the company could be revised by a material amount 
inventories slow moving and obsolescence the company carries significant amounts of inventories  which is a part of the company s strategy as a competitive advantage in its ability to fulfill the vast majority of our customers orders the same day received 
however  this strategy also increases the chances that portions of the inventory have decreased in value below their carrying cost 
to reduce inventory to a lower of cost or market value  the company records a reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory 
the company defines obsolete as those inventory parts on hand which the company plans to discontinue offering to its customers 
slow moving inventory is monitored by examining reports of parts which have not been sold for extended periods 
the company records the reserve needed based on its historical experience of how much the selling prices must be reduced to move these obsolete and slow moving products 
if experience or market conditions change  estimates of the reserves needed could be revised by a material amount 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the company records a provision for income taxes based on domestic and international statutory income tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances  including the estimation of valuation allowances and the evaluation of tax positions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  through its foreign subsidiaries  distributes products in canada and mexico 
the functional currency of these subsidiaries is their respective local currencies which are translated into us dollars 
as a result  the company is from time to time exposed to market risk relating to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates
