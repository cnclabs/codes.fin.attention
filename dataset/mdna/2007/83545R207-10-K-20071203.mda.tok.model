overview sonic foundry  inc is a technology leader in the emerging web communications marketplace  providing enterprise solutions and services that link an information driven world 
the company s principal product line  mediasite is a web communication and content management system that automatically and cost effectively webcasts lectures and presentations 
trusted by fortune companies  top education institutions and federal  state and local government agencies for a variety of critical communication needs  mediasite is the leading one to many multimedia communication solution for capturing knowledge and sharing it online 
critical accounting policies we have identified the following as critical accounting policies to our company and have discussed the development  selection of estimates and the disclosure regarding them with the audit committee of the board of directors revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets  and accounting for stock based compensation 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts general revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery occurs or services are rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue is deferred when undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of delivered products  customer acceptance is uncertain  significant obligations remain  or the fair value of undelivered elements is unknown 
the company does 
table of contents sonic foundry  inc annual report on form k for the year ended september  not offer customers the right to return product  other than for exchange or repair pursuant to a warranty or stock rotation 
the company s policy is to reduce revenue if it incurs an obligation for price rebates or other such programs during the period the obligation is reasonably estimated to occur 
the following policies apply to the company s major categories of revenue transactions 
products products are considered delivered  and revenue is recognized  when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer 
under the terms and conditions of the sale  this occurs at the time of shipment to the customer 
product revenue currently represents sales of our mediasite recorders and mediasite related products such as server software revenue 
services we sell support contracts to our customers  typically one year in length  and record the related revenue ratably over the contractual period 
our support contracts cover phone and electronic technical support availability over and above the level provided by our distributors  software upgrades on a when and if available basis  and an extension of the standard hardware warranty from days to one year 
the manufacturer we contract with to build the units performs hardware warranty service 
we also sell installation  training  event webcasting  and customer content hosting services 
revenue for those services is recognized when performed in the case of installation  training and event webcasting services and is recognized ratably over the contract period for content hosting services 
service amounts invoiced to customers in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are met 
other other revenue consists of non mediasite software licensing  custom software development performed under time and materials or fixed fee arrangements and amounts charged for shipping and handling 
software licensing is recorded when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery occurs  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
shipping and handling is recorded at the time of shipment to the customer 
revenue arrangements that include multiple elements revenue for transactions that include multiple elements such as hardware  software  training  support or content hosting agreements is allocated to each element based on its relative fair value and recognized for each element when the revenue recognition criteria have been met for such element 
fair value is generally determined based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
in the absence of fair value of a delivered element  revenue is allocated first to the fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
the company recognizes revenue for delivered elements only when all of the following criteria are satisfied undelivered elements are not essential to the functionality of delivered elements  uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved  and the fair value for all undelivered elements is known 
reserves we record reserves for stock rotations  rebates  and sales incentives to reduce revenue and accounts receivable for these and other credits we may grant to customers 
such reserves are recorded at the time of sale and are calculated based on historical information such as rates of product stock rotations and the specific terms of sales programs  taking into account any other known information about likely customer behavior 
if actual customer behavior differs from our expectations  additional reserves may be required 
also  if we determine that we can no longer accurately estimate amounts for stock rotations and sales incentives  we would not be able to recognize revenue until the customers exercise their rights  or such rights lapse  whichever is later 

table of contents sonic foundry  inc annual report on form k for the year ended september  shipping and handling costs related to shipping and handling are included in cost of revenue for all periods presented 
credit evaluation and allowance for doubtful accounts we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral 
we maintain allowances for potential credit losses and such losses have been within our expectations 
impairment of long lived assets we assess the impairment of goodwill and capitalized software development costs on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of these assets is less than the carrying value 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following poor economic performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry  economic or company specific trends  changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the plans for our business  and loss of key personnel if we determine that the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value  based upon the annual test or the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would then measure impairment based on a comparison of the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
to the extent the carrying amount of goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of goodwill  we would record an impairment charge for the difference 
we evaluate all of our long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill  for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate all of our long lived assets and intangible assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill  for impairment 
long lived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset 
should events indicate that any of our long lived assets are impaired  the amount of such impairment will be measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset and recorded in earnings during the period of such impairment 
valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using currently enacted tax rates and laws 
deferred income taxes also arise from the future benefits of net operating loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance equal to of the net deferred tax assets has been recognized due to uncertainty regarding future realization 
accounting for stock based compensation the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized in the years ended september  and include the cost for all stock options granted prior to  but not yet vested as of october  this cost was based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas the cost for all share based awards granted subsequent to september   represents the grant date fair value that was estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
compensation cost for options will be recognized in earnings  net of estimated forfeitures  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
upon the adoption of sfas r  the company changed its option valuation model from the black scholes model to a lattice valuation model for all stock options granted subsequent to september  the lattice valuation model is a more flexible analysis to value employee options because of its ability to incorporate inputs that change over time  such as actual exercise behavior of option holders 
the company used historical data to estimate the 
table of contents sonic foundry  inc annual report on form k for the year ended september  option exercise and employee departure behavior used in the lattice valuation model 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company s stock 
the company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model 
the company considers all employees to have similar exercise behavior and therefore has not identified separate homogenous groups for valuation 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option pricing model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual term of the options is based on the us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant
