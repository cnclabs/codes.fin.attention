item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources credit facilities we sold in a public offering in june  and approximately billion is drawn under our credit facility defined 
table of contents in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources senior notes 
the credit facility provides for a senior secured term loan facility of billion  with the ability to increase it by up to billion as of june   under certain circumstances the term loan facility and a senior secured revolving credit facility of billion with the ability to increase it by up to million the revolving facility 
substantially all of our assets are pledged to secure our credit facility and our senior notes 
if we are fully drawn under our credit facility including the increase resulting from the accordion features of the revolving facility  the book value of our equity may be in a deficit position 
the interest rates under the credit facility fluctuate with changes in the market rates and with changes in our leverage ratio 
thus  our debt service cost will increase as market interest rates increase and as our leverage ratio increases 
it will be necessary to utilize cash flow from operating activities to fund debt service cost related to our indebtedness 
if we fail to have sufficient cash flow to satisfy the debt service cost of our indebtedness  then we could default on our indebtedness  resulting in foreclosure on the assets used to conduct our business 
in addition  reduction of our available cash flow may negatively impact our business  including our ability to make future acquisitions  ability to compete for customer contracts requiring upfront capital costs  and our ability to meet our other obligations 
further  the amount of our indebtedness and our reduction in available cash flow may limit our ability to obtain further debt or equity financing 
alleged defaults and purported acceleration of our senior notes  if upheld in litigation  could have a negative impact on our cash flow and divert resources that could otherwise be utilized in our business operations 
certain holders of our senior notes have alleged that we have defaulted under our senior notes and have accelerated payment of the principal and accrued interest on the senior notes 
we have taken the position that no default and no acceleration has occurred with respect to the senior notes or otherwise under the indenture dated june  the indenture between us and the bank of new york trust company  na  which has been subsequently replaced as trustee by wilmington trust company the trustee  and filed a lawsuit against the trustee in the united states district court  northern district of texas  dallas division  seeking a declaratory judgment affirming our position 
there can be no assurance of the outcome of that lawsuit 
if a final judgment is rendered that there has been a default and acceleration has occurred  then we may have to pay the principal and accrued interest under the senior notes 
while we do have availability under our credit facility to draw funds to repay the senior notes  there may be a decrease in our credit availability that could otherwise be used for other corporate purposes  such as acquisitions and share repurchases 
the complexity of regulatory environments in which we operate has increased and may continue to increase our costs 
our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance  public disclosure  accounting and tax requirements and environmental legislation that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 
because our class a common stock and senior notes are publicly traded  we are subject to certain rules and regulations for federal  state and financial market exchange entities including the public company accounting oversight board  the sec and the nyse 
we have implemented new policies and procedures and continue developing additional policies and procedures in response to recent corporate scandals and laws enacted by congress 
without limiting the generality of the foregoing  we have made a significant effort to comply with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of including  among other things the development of policies and procedures to satisfy the provisions thereof regarding internal control over financial reporting  disclosure controls and procedures and certification of financial statements appearing in periodic reports and the formation of a compliance department to develop policies and monitor compliance with laws including  among others  privacy laws  export control laws  rules and regulations of the office of foreign asset controls and the foreign corrupt practices act 
our effort to comply with these new regulations have resulted in  and are likely to continue resulting in  increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
we are subject to the oversight of the sec and other regulatory agencies and investigations by those agencies could divert management s focus and could have a material adverse impact on our reputation and financial condition 
as a result of this regulation and oversight  we may be subject to legal and administrative proceedings 
we are currently the subject of an ongoing sec and department of justice doj investigation related to our historical stock option grant practices 
as a result of these investigations  several derivative lawsuits have been filed in connection with our stock option grant practices generally alleging claims related to breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment by certain of our directors and senior executives 
as the result of these investigations and shareholder actions  we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal costs and a significant amount of time of our senior management has been focused on these matters that otherwise would have been directed toward the growth and development of our business 
we have concluded our internal investigation of our stock option grant practices as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the sec and doj investigations are continuing and until these investigations of our stock option grant practices are complete  we are unable to predict the effect  if any  that these investigations and lawsuits will have on our business and financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
we cannot assure that the sec and or doj will not seek to impose fines or take other actions against us that could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition 
in addition  publicity surrounding the 
table of contents sec s and doj s investigations  the derivative causes of actions  or any enforcement action  even if ultimately resolved favorably for us  could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows  financial condition  results of operations or business 
reductions of our credit rating may have an adverse impact on our business 
the ratings on our current outstanding obligations currently established by the ratings agencies are below investment grade 
there may be reductions in our ratings if we incur additional indebtedness  including amounts that may be drawn under our credit facility 
below investment grade ratings could negatively impact our ability to renew contracts with our existing customers  limit our ability to compete for new customers  result in increased premiums for surety bonds to support our customer contracts  and or result in a requirement that we provide collateral to secure our surety bonds 
further  certain of our commercial outsourcing contracts provide that in the event our credit ratings are downgraded to specified levels  the customer may elect to terminate its contract with us and either pay a reduced termination fee or  in some limited instances  no termination fee 
a credit rating downgrade could adversely affect these customer relationships 
a decline in revenues from or a loss of significant clients could reduce our profitability and cash flow 
our revenues  profitability  financial condition and cash flow could be materially adversely affected by the loss of significant clients and or the reduction of volumes and services provided to our significant clients as a result of  among other things  their merger or acquisition  divestiture of assets or businesses  contract expiration  non renewal or early termination including termination for convenience or business failure or deterioration 
in addition  we incur fixed costs related to our information technology services and business process outsourcing clients 
therefore the loss of any one of our significant clients could leave us with a significantly higher level of fixed costs than is necessary to serve our remaining clients  thereby reducing our profitability and cash flow 
our ability to recover capital investments in connection with our contracts is subject to risk 
in order to attract and retain large outsourcing contracts we sometimes make significant capital investments to perform the agreement  such as purchases of information technology equipment and costs incurred to develop and implement software 
the net book value of such assets recorded  including a portion of our intangible assets  could be impaired  and our earnings and cash flow could be materially adversely affected in the event of the early termination of all or a part of such a contract or the reduction in volumes and services thereunder for reasons such as  among other things  a client s merger or acquisition  divestiture of assets or businesses  business failure or deterioration  or a client s exercise of contract termination rights 
we have non recurring revenue  which subjects us to a risk that our revenues from year to year may fluctuate 
revenue generated from our non recurring services  including our consulting and unclaimed property escheatment services  may increase or decrease in relation to the revenue generated from our recurring services  such as business process outsourcing and information technology outsourcing 
our mix of non recurring and recurring revenues is impacted by acquisitions as well as growth in our non recurring lines of business 
there is less predictability and certainty in the timing and amount of revenue generated by our non recurring services and  accordingly  our revenues  results of operations and cash flow may be significantly impacted by the timing and amounts of revenues generated from our non recurring services 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively 
we expect to encounter additional competition as we address new markets and new competitors enter our existing markets 
if we are forced to lower our pricing or if demand for our services decreases  our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow may be materially and adversely affected 
some of our competitors have substantially greater resources  and they may be able to use their resources to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies  to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services  or to obtain client contracts where sizable asset purchases  investments or financing support are required 
in addition  we must frequently compete with a client s own internal business process and information technology capabilities  which may constitute a fixed cost for the client 
in the future  competition could continue to emerge from large computer hardware or software providers as they shift their business strategy to include services 
competition has also emerged from european and indian offshore service providers seeking to expand into our markets and from large consulting companies seeking operational outsourcing opportunities please see discussion in item  part business competition 
also  we believe that our ability to compete for new business may be impacted by the uncertainty surrounding our future ownership structure 
we may not be able to make acquisitions that will complement our growth 
historically  we have made a significant number of acquisitions that have expanded the products and services we offer  provided a presence in a complementary business or expanded our geographic presence 
we intend to continue our acquisition strategy 
please see discussion in item  part business business strategy 
we cannot  however  make any assurances that we will be able to identify any potential acquisition candidates or consummate any additional acquisitions or that any future 
table of contents acquisitions will be successfully integrated or will be advantageous to us 
without additional acquisitions  we are unlikely to maintain historical total growth rates 
a failure to properly manage our operations and our growth could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have rapidly expanded our operations in recent years 
we intend to continue expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities 
some market opportunities require that we develop software to perform the services we become contractually obligated to perform  such as our medicaid activities 
this rapid growth places a significant demand on our management and operational resources 
in order to manage growth effectively  we must design  develop  implement and improve our operational systems  which includes the design  development and implementation of software  if necessary  and timely development and implementation of procedures and controls 
if we fail to design  develop and implement these systems and to make improvements to these systems  we may not be able to service our clients needs  hire and retain new employees  pursue new business opportunities  complete future acquisitions or operate our businesses effectively 
we could also trigger contractual credits to clients or a contractual default 
failure to properly transition new clients to our systems  properly budget transition costs or accurately estimate new contract operational costs could result in delays in our contract performance  trigger service level penalties  impairments of fixed or intangible assets or result in contracts whose profit margins did not meet our expectations or our historical profit margins 
failure to properly integrate acquired operations could result in increased cost 
as a result of any of these problems associated with expansion  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected 
our government contracts are subject to termination rights  audits and investigations  which  if exercised  could negatively impact our reputation and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts 
approximately of our fiscal year revenues were derived from contracts with state and local governments and from federal government agencies  including our contract with the department of education 
governments and their agencies may terminate most of these contracts at any time  without cause 
also  our department of education contract is subject to the approval of appropriations being made by the united states congress to fund the expenditures to be made by the federal government under this contract 
additionally  government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations by government agencies 
if the government finds that we improperly charged any costs to a contract  the costs are not reimbursable or  if already reimbursed  the cost must be refunded to the government 
if the government discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations  the contractor may be subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  which may include termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government 
any resulting penalties or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
further  the negative publicity that arises from findings in such audits  investigations or the penalties or sanctions therefore could have an adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts and may also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
we may incur delays in signing and commencing new business as the result of protests of government contracts that we are awarded 
after an award of a government contract  a competing bidder may protest the award 
if we are awarded the contract and it is protested  it will be necessary to incur costs to defend the award of the contract 
costs to defend an award may be significant and could include hiring experts to defend the basis for the contract award 
some contract protests may take years to resolve 
in some instances where we are awarded a contract  the contracting government entity may request that we sign a contract and commence services  even though the contract award has been protested 
if the protest is upheld  then our contract would be terminated and the amounts due to us for services that have been performed to date would be subject to payment pursuant to the terms of the terminated contract 
such terms may not provide for full recovery of our incurred costs 
in addition  if the government agency requests that we make changes to our contractual agreement during a protest period  but the government agency is unable or unwilling to modify the contract at the end of the protest period whether or not we are successful in defending the protest  we may be unable to recover the full costs incurred in making such changes 
in addition  we may suffer negative publicity as the result of any contract protest being upheld and our contract being terminated 
further  if there is a re bid of the contract  we would incur additional costs associated with the re bid process and be subject to a potential protest if we are awarded a subsequent contract 
the exercise of contract termination provisions and service level penalties may have an adverse impact on our business 
most of our contracts with our clients permit termination in the event our performance is not consistent with service levels specified in those contracts  or require us to provide credits to our clients for failure to meet service levels 
in addition  if clients are not satisfied with our level of performance  our clients may seek damages as permitted under the contract and or our reputation in the industry may suffer  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow 

table of contents some of our contracts contain pricing provisions that could adversely affect our operating results and cash flow 
some of our contracts contain pricing provisions requiring that our services be priced based on a fixed price or a fixed price per transaction 
in addition  some contract provisions permit a customer to request that their pricing be established by reference to a pre established standard or benchmark and some of our contracts contain re pricing provisions which can result in reductions of our fees for performing our services 
in such situations  we are exposed to the risk that we may be unable to price our services to levels that will permit recovery of our costs  and may adversely affect our operating results and cash flow 
claims associated with our actuarial consulting and benefit plan management services could negatively impact our business 
in may  we acquired the human resources consulting business of mellon financial corporation  which includes actuarial consulting services related to commercial  governmental and taft hartley pension plans 
providers of these types of consulting services have experienced frequent claims  some of which have resulted in litigation and significant settlements or judgments  particularly when investment markets have performed poorly and pension funding levels have been adversely impacted 
in addition  our total benefits outsourcing business unit manages and administers benefit plans on behalf of its clients and is responsible for processing numerous plan transactions for current and former employees of those clients 
we are subject to claims from the client and its current and former employees if transactions are not properly processed 
if any claim is made against us in the future related to our actuarial consulting services or benefit plan management services  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected as a result of the time and cost required to defend such a claim  the cost of settling such a claim or paying any judgments resulting therefrom  or the damage to our reputation in the industry that could result from the negative publicity surrounding such a claim 
the loss of or change in our significant software vendor relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our ability to service our clients depends to a large extent on our use of various software programs that we license from a small number of primary software vendors 
if our significant software vendors were to terminate  refuse to renew our contracts with them or offer to renew our contracts with them on less advantageous terms than previously contracted  we might not be able to replace the related software programs and would be unable to serve our clients or we would recognize reduced margins from the contracts with our clients  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  revenues  financial position  profitability and cash flow 
we may be subject to claims of infringement of third party intellectual property rights which could adversely affect our business 
we rely heavily on the use of intellectual property 
we do not own the majority of the software that we use to run our business  instead we license this software from a small number of primary vendors 
if these vendors assert claims that we or our clients are infringing on their software or related intellectual property  we could incur substantial costs to defend these claims  which could have a material effect on our profitability and cash flow 
in addition  if any of our vendors infringement claims are ultimately successful  our vendors could require us to cease selling or using products or services that incorporate the challenged software or technology  to obtain a license or additional licenses from our vendors  or to redesign our products and services which rely on the challenged software or technology 
if we are unsuccessful in the defense of an infringement claim and our vendors require us to initiate any of the above actions  then such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
we are subject to united states and foreign jurisdiction laws relating to individually identifiable information  and failure to comply with those laws  whether or not inadvertent  could subject us to legal actions and negatively impact our operations 
we process  transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals  both in our role as a service provider and as an employer 
as a result  we are subject to numerous united states both federal and state and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect individually identifiable information  including social security numbers  financial and health information 
for example  in  congress passed the health insurance portability and accountability act and as required therein  the department of health and human services established regulations governing  among other things  the privacy  security and electronic transmission of individually identifiable health information 
we have taken measures to comply with each of those regulations on or before the required dates 
another example is the european union directive on data protection  entitled directive ec of the european parliament and of the council of october on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data 
we have also taken steps to address the requirements of that directive 
other united states both federal and state and foreign jurisdiction laws apply to the processing of individually identifiable information as well  and additional legislation may be enacted at any time 
failure to comply with these types of laws may subject us to  among other things  liability for monetary damages  fines and or criminal prosecution  unfavorable publicity  restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations  any of which may have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow 

table of contents we are subject to breaches of our security system 
security systems have been implemented with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and to protecting confidential information and information related to identifiable individuals against unauthorized access through our information systems 
despite such efforts  we are subject to breach of security systems which may result in unauthorized access to our facilities and or the information we are trying to protect 
in addition  we transmit such information electronically or often rely on third party vendors to transport physical media such as tapes and disks containing such information to and from our facilities or those of our customers and suppliers 
if unauthorized parties gain physical access to a company facility or electronic access to our information systems or such information is misdirected  lost or stolen during transmission or transport  any theft or misuse of such information could result in  among other things  unfavorable publicity  governmental inquiry and oversight  difficulty in marketing our services  allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations  litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information  any of which may have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow 
budget deficits and or fluctuations in the number of requests for proposals issued by state and local governments and their agencies may adversely impact our business 
approximately of our fiscal year revenues were derived from contracts with federal  state and local governments and their agencies 
from time to time  state and local governments with which we have contracts may face budget deficits 
also  the number of requests for proposals issued by state and local government agencies are subject to fluctuation 
a significant number of government contracts have provisions permitting termination by the contracting government agency for convenience 
if state and local budgets were to be reduced  then services we provided could become non essential and our contracts could be terminated and future contracting opportunities for government contracts would be limited 
such an event would reduce our revenue and profitability 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks 
recently we have expanded our international operations and also continually contemplate the acquisition of companies formed and operating in foreign countries 
we have approximately  employees in mexico  india  jamaica  ghana  the philippines  guatemala  canada  spain  malaysia  united kingdom  dominican republic and france  as well as a number of other countries  that primarily support our commercial business process and information technology services 
our international operations and acquisitions are subject to a number of risks 
these risks include the possible impact on our operations of the laws of foreign countries where we may do business including  among others  data privacy  laws regarding licensing and labor council requirements 
in addition  we may experience difficulty integrating the management and operations of businesses we acquire internationally  and we may have difficulty attracting  retaining and motivating highly skilled and qualified personnel to staff key managerial positions in our ongoing international operations 
further  our international operations are subject to a number of risks related to general economic and political conditions in foreign countries where we operate  including  among others  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  cultural differences  political instability  employee work stoppages or strikes and additional expenses and risks inherent in conducting operations in geographically distant locations 
our international operations may also be impacted by trade restrictions  such as tariffs and duties or other trade controls imposed by the united states or other jurisdictions  as well as other factors that may adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
because of these foreign operations we are subject to regulations  such as those administered by the department of treasury s office of foreign assets controls ofac and export control regulations administered by the department of commerce 
violation of these regulations could result in fines  criminal sanctions against our officers  and prohibitions against exporting  as well as damage to our reputation  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
armed hostilities and terrorist attacks may negatively impact the countries in which we operate 
our operations and customers are located throughout the globe  including some politically unstable jurisdictions 
terrorist attacks and further acts of violence or war may cause major instability in the us and other financial markets in which we operate 
in addition  armed hostilities and acts of terrorism may directly impact our physical facilities and operations  which are located in north america  central america  south america  europe  africa  australia  asia and the middle east  or those of our clients 
these developments subject our worldwide operations to increased risks and  depending on their magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a failure to attract and retain necessary technical personnel  skilled management and qualified subcontractors may have an adverse impact on our business 
because we operate in intensely competitive markets  our success depends to a significant extent upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel and to subcontract with qualified  competent subcontractors 
if we fail to attract  train  and retain sufficient numbers of qualified engineers  technical staff and sales and marketing representatives or are unable to contract with qualified  competent subcontractors  our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
table of contents will be materially and adversely affected 
experienced and capable personnel in the technology industry remain in high demand  and there is continual competition for their talents 
additionally  we may be required to increase our hiring in geographic areas outside of the united states  which could subject us to increased geopolitical and exchange rate risk 
our success also depends on the skills  experience  and performance of key members of our management team 
the loss of any key employee or the loss of a key subcontractor relationship could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flow  results of operations and prospects 
risks associated with loans that we service may reduce our profitability and cash flow 
we service for various lenders and under various service agreements a portfolio of approximately million loans with an outstanding principal balance of approximately billion as of june  made under the federal family education loan program  which loans are guaranteed by a federal government agency 
if a loan is in default  then a claim is made upon the guarantor 
if the guarantor denies the claim because of a servicing error  then under certain of the servicing agreements we may be required to purchase the loan from the lender 
upon purchase of the loan  we attempt to cure the servicing errors and either sell the loan back to the guarantor which must occur within a specified period of time or sell the loan on the open market to a third party 
we are subject to the risk that we may be unable to cure the servicing errors or sell the loan on the open market 
our reserves  which are based on historical information  may be inadequate if our servicing performance results in the requirement that we repurchase a substantial number of loans  which repurchase could have a material adverse impact on our cash flow and profitability 
a disruption in utility or network services may have a negative impact on our business 
our services are dependent on other companies providing electricity and other utilities to our operating facilities  as well as network companies providing connectivity to our facilities and clients 
since key portions of our business include information technology services and systems integration  we rely on network connectivity at all times 
many of our facilities are located in jurisdictions outside of the united states where the provision of utility services  including electricity and water  may not be consistently reliable 
while there are backup systems in many of our operating facilities  an extended outage of utility or network services may have a material adverse effect on our operations  revenues  cash flow and profitability 
our indemnification obligations may have a material adverse effect on our business 
many of our contracts  including our agreements with respect to divestitures  include various indemnification obligations 
if we are required to satisfy an indemnification obligation  we may have to spend time and cost to defend and settle claims for our indemnities  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  profitability and cash flow 
other risks we have attempted to identify material risk factors currently affecting our business and company 
however  additional risks that we do not yet know of  or that we currently think are immaterial  may occur or become material 
these risks could impair our business operations or adversely affect revenues  cash flow or profitability

overview we derive our revenues from delivering comprehensive business process outsourcing and information technology services solutions to commercial and government clients 
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from recurring monthly charges to our clients under service contracts with initial terms that vary from one to ten years 
we define recurring revenues as revenues derived from services that our clients use each year in connection with their ongoing businesses  and accordingly  exclude software license fees  short term contract programming and consulting engagements  product installation fees  and hardware and software sales 
however  as we add  through acquisitions or new service offerings  consulting or other services to enhance the value delivered and offered to our clients  which are primarily short term in nature  we may experience variations in our mix of recurring versus non recurring revenues 
since inception  our acquisition program has resulted in growth and diversification of our client base  expansion of services and products offered  increased economies of scale and geographic expansion 
management focuses on various metrics in analyzing our business and its performance and outlook 
one such metric is our sales pipeline  which was approximately billion of annual recurring revenues as of june  our sales pipeline is a qualified pipeline of deals with signings anticipated within the next six months and excludes deals with annual recurring revenue over million 
both the commercial and government pipelines have significant  quality opportunities across multiple lines of business and in multiple vertical markets  including opportunities in business process outsourcing  human resources outsourcing  commercial and government healthcare and transportation services  including international opportunities  commercial and government information technology services and federal government services 
we analyze the cash flow generation qualities of each deal in our pipeline and make decisions based on its cash return characteristics 
while the magnitude of our sales pipeline is an important indicator of potential new business signings and potential future internal revenue growth  actual new business signings and internal revenue growth depend on a number of factors including the effectiveness of our sales pursuit teams  competition for a deal  deal pricing and other risks described further in item a 
risk factors 
we use internal revenue growth as a measure of the organic growth of our business 
internal revenue growth is measured as total revenue growth less acquired revenue from acquisitions and revenues from divested operations 
at the date of acquisition  we identify the trailing twelve months of revenue of the acquired company as the pre acquisition revenue of acquired companies 
pre acquisition revenue of the acquired companies is considered acquired revenues in our calculation  and revenues from the acquired company  either above or below that amount are components of internal growth in our calculation 
we use the calculation of internal revenue growth to measure revenue growth excluding the impact of acquired revenues and the revenue associated with divested operations and we believe these adjustments to historical reported results are necessary to accurately reflect our internal revenue growth 
revenues from divested operations are excluded from the internal revenue growth calculation in the periods following the effective date of the divestiture 
prior period internal revenue growth calculations are not restated for current period divestitures 
our measure of internal revenue growth may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
management analyzes new business signings on a trailing twelve month basis as it is generally a better indicator of future growth than quarterly new business signings which can vary due to timing of contract execution 
we define new business signings as annual recurring revenue from new contracts  including the incremental portion of renewals  signed during the period and represent the estimated first twelve months of revenue to be recorded under that contract after full implementation 
we use new business signings as additional measures of estimating total revenue represented by contractual commitments  both to forecast prospective revenues and to estimate capital commitments 
revenues for new business signings are measured under gaap 
there are no third party standards or requirements governing the calculation of new business signings and our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
during fiscal year we signed approximately 
table of contents million of annual recurring revenue and estimated total contract value of billion 
we define total contract value as the estimated total revenues from contracts signed during the period and represents estimated total revenue over the term of the contract 
we use total contract value as an additional measure of estimating total revenue represented by contractual commitments  both to forecast prospective revenues and to estimate capital commitments 
revenues for annual recurring revenue and total contract value are measured under gaap 
renewal rates are a key indicator of client satisfaction 
we calculate our renewal rate based on the total annual recurring revenue of renewals won as a percentage of total annual recurring revenue of all renewals sought 
during fiscal year  we renewed approximately of total renewals sought totaling approximately million of annual recurring revenue with a total contract value of approximately billion 
average contract life for renewals typically varies between our government and commercial segments  with the average contract life of renewals in the government segment often shorter than those in the commercial segment 
while we track renewal rates on a quarterly basis  we believe it is appropriate to analyze our renewal rates on an annual basis due to the timing of renewal opportunities 
we compete for new business in the competitive information technology services and business process outsourcing markets 
the overall health of these markets and the competitive environment can be determined by analyzing several key metrics 
one such metric is the overall expected operating margin of our new business signings which is a good indicator of our expected future operating margin given the long term nature of our customer contracts 
we are seeing that the overall expected operating margin of new business signings is consistent with our historical operating margin 
we focus on the expected operating margins of the new business we are signing to ensure the operating margins we expect to generate are commensurate with the capital intensity of the new business opportunity  the risk profile of the services we are providing and the overall return on capital 
we monitor the capital intensity  defined as capital expenditures and additions to intangible assets  of new business signings 
understanding the capital intensity of new business signings is helpful in determining the future free cash flow generating levels of our business 
historically  the capital intensity in our business has ranged between to 
during fiscal year  the overall capital intensity of our business was approximately 
during fiscal year  the overall capital intensity of our business was due to approximately million in investments that we made in certain areas of our business 
these investments included investments related to integrating the acquired hr business defined below and expanding our human resources outsourcing technology platform  investments made in our government healthcare technology platforms  the expansion of our data center capacity with the addition of a new data center and investments to increase global production both in existing locations and new geographies 
the expected capital intensity of new business signings during fiscal year was consistent with our historical range 
we believe the expected capital intensity range of our new business signings reflects a healthy competitive environment and the related risks we are taking with respect to our new business process outsourcing business and information technology services business 
retaining and training our employees is a key ingredient to our historical success and will continue to be a major factor in our future success 
we consistently review our employee retention rates on a regional and global basis to ensure that we are competitive in hiring  retaining and motivating our employees 
we perform benchmarking studies against some markets in which we compete to ensure our competitiveness in compensation and benefits and utilize employee surveys to gauge our employees level of satisfaction 
we provide our employees ongoing technological  management  financial and leadership training and will continue to do so to develop our employees and remain competitive 
we utilize activity based compensation as a means to motivate certain of our employees in both segments of our business and anticipate increasing our use of activity based compensation in fiscal year we believe our use of activity based compensation is a competitive advantage for acs 
outlook as a premier provider of business process outsourcing and information technology services  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from commercial and governmental entities demand to outsource non core  mission critical back office functions 
demand for commercial business process and information technology services is expected to remain healthy during fiscal year however  we believe that our ability to compete for new business may be impacted by the uncertainty surrounding our future ownership structure 
areas of strong demand in the commercial segment include transactional business process outsourcing  multi scope human resources outsourcing  finance and accounting outsourcing  customer care outsourcing and traditional information technology services 
we also anticipate healthy demand for our government services 
in addition to the areas that we have marketed historically  such as government healthcare  municipal services  electronic payment services and transportation services and solutions  we continue to believe that government entities could benefit from our commercial best practices around such areas as eligibility administration  human resources outsourcing  customer care and finance and accounting outsourcing 
from a 
table of contents geographic perspective  we believe that there will continue to be strong demand in the united states and expect to see more business process outsourcing opportunities in europe and abroad 
in order to capitalize on opportunities in these markets  we will continue to make certain investments and reorganizations in our business in fiscal year during fiscal  we completed strategic acquisitions in specific segments of our business including the learning outsourcing component of human resources outsourcing  the cost recovery and credit balance auditing segments of commercial healthcare markets  information systems consulting and integration market  and the integrated eligibility market 
these acquisitions should allow us to capitalize on strong demand in these vertical markets 
during fiscal year  we performed a critical review of our operations and restructured certain operations and shed non core businesses 
we continued our restructuring activities in fiscal year  and recorded certain restructuring charges and asset impairments arising from our discretionary decisions in that period 
we believe that these restructuring activities will help us better compete in the diverse markets that we serve 
in the commercial segment  our primary goal for fiscal is to increase internal revenue growth 
we believe we will be able to accomplish this goal with our existing and future changes to our organizational structure  deepening our relationships with our clients and utilizing our operational and process re engineering skills 
we intend to pursue strategic acquisitions to build upon our existing service capabilities  expand our service offerings and increase our service innovation 
we expect to strengthen our organization by promoting leaders from within the company as well as recruiting top industry talent 
we also plan to increase our penetration of low cost delivery locations outside the united states 
in the government segment  we expect to expand our innovative solutions and platforms  including our software solutions for the state medicaid market 
we expect to leverage our existing broad international presence and subject matter expertise in the transportation services market to markets beyond transportation 
we believe we can expand our existing solutions in the property  public safety and judicial markets for solutions that we can utilize globally 
in both segments  we plan to deepen our use of incentive based compensation 
significant developments review of stock option grant practices on march   we received notice from the securities and exchange commission that it was conducting an investigation into certain stock option grants made by us from october through march on june  and on june   we received requests from the sec for information on all of our stock option grants since we have been providing supplemental information to the sec on a voluntary basis following the initial sec requests 
subsequent to may   the date of our last quarterly filing with the commission  the company has learned that the sec obtained a formal order of investigation in this matter in august we are continuing to cooperate with the sec s investigation 
restructuring activities during fiscal year  we began a comprehensive assessment of our operations  including our overall cost structure  competitive position  technology assets and operating platform and foreign operations 
as a result  we began certain restructuring initiatives and activities that are expected to enhance our competitive position in certain markets  and recorded certain restructuring charges and asset impairments arising from our discretionary decisions 
as of june   approximately  employees have been involuntarily terminated as a result of these initiatives  consisting primarily of offshore processors and related management  however  we anticipate that a majority of these positions would be migrated to lower cost markets 
we anticipate the costs savings related to these involuntary terminations will be approximately million million related to terminations in fiscal year of wages and benefits per year  however  some of the cost savings from these involuntary terminations will be reinvested in subject matter experts  project management talent and sales personnel as we look to further promote those lines of businesses that reflect the greatest potential for growth 
our assessment activities are ongoing and may result in further restructuring and related charges  the amount and timing of which cannot be determined at this time 
in our commercial segment  we began an assessment of the cost structure of our global production model  particularly our offshore processing activities

stock based compensation on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and recognize compensation cost in its financial statements

fiscal year ended june  cash paid for interest on outstanding debt  which was higher in fiscal year primarily due to our share repurchase program cash paid for final settlement of the mellon financial corporate mellon transition services agreement a cash paid for incentive compensation to employees of the acquired hr business a cash received for interest income cash paid for legal fees and other costs related to the investigations into our stock option grant practices  derivative lawsuits related to our stock option grant practices and the potential sale of the company as discussed above cash paid on tax  interest and penalties related to our stock option grant practices as discussed above a during fiscal year  we paid approximately million related to the final settlement of the mellon transition services agreement 
under the transition services agreement  mellon provided certain accounting  treasury and payroll services for an interim period while we integrated the acquired hr business 
as part of these services  mellon was also paying certain operational costs on our behalf  such as employee related expenses and accounts payable 
this agreement and the related timing of payments to mellon had a favorable impact on our net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow defined below in fiscal year of million and a negative impact on our net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in fiscal year of million when the acquired hr business was fully integrated 
during fiscal year  we also paid approximately million to employees of the acquired hr business related to incentive compensation that was earned prior to the date that we acquired the business 
our fiscal year cash flows provided by operating activities were also impacted by collections of accounts receivable  offset by timing of collections of unearned revenue  as well as payments for hardware and software maintenance during the fiscal year fiscal year cash flows provided by operating activities were also impacted by an increase in accounts receivables related to signed new business and timing of collections related to other accounts receivable and payments of approximately million related to the departure of jeffrey a 
rich  our former chief executive officer 
these decreases were offset by lower annual incentive compensation payments and timing of payments to vendors 
accounts receivable fluctuations may have a significant impact on our cash flows provided by operating activities 
the payments received from clients on our billed accounts receivables and the increase in such accounts receivable are reflected as a single component of our cash flows provided by operating activities  and the timing of collections of these receivables may have either a positive or negative impact on our liquidity 
for fiscal years and  excess tax benefits from stock based compensation awards of million and million  respectively  were reflected as an outflow in cash flows from operating activities and an inflow in cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows  resulting in a net impact of zero on cash 
during fiscal year  income tax benefits from the exercise of stock options of million were reflected as an inflow in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
however  had sfas r been in effect for fiscal year  the portion of those income tax benefits that would have been characterized as excess tax benefits in the consolidated statements 
table of contents of cash flows would have been million and would have decreased cash flows from operating activities and increased cash flows from financing activities accordingly 
during fiscal year  we generated approximately million in cash flows provided by operating activities 
as discussed above  fiscal year cash flows provided by operating activities includes a temporary benefit of million related to the transition services agreement with mellon 
fiscal year cash flows provided by operating activities were negatively impacted by the payment of approximately million related to the settlement of the interest rate hedges associated with the issuance of the senior notes please see derivative instruments and hedging activities below  the payment of a legal settlement of million and the payment of the settlement on a client contract of million  both of which were accrued during fiscal year  as well as the timing of payments related to software used in our information technology services business  transfer agent fees related to our unclaimed property business and other contract related costs  offset by increased net income and increased collections on our accounts receivable balances 
free cash flow is measured as cash flow provided by operating activities as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flow  less capital expenditures purchases of property  equipment and software  net of sales  as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flow less additions to other intangible assets as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we believe this free cash flow metric provides an additional measure of available cash flow after we have satisfied the capital expenditure requirements of our operations  and should not be taken in isolation to be a measure of cash flow available for us to satisfy all of our obligations and execute our business strategies 
we also rely on cash flows from investing and financing activities which  together with free cash flow  are expected to be sufficient for us to execute our business strategies 
our measure of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
the following table sets forth the calculations of free cash flow in thousands fiscal year ended june  net cash provided by operating activities purchases of property  equipment and software  net additions to other intangible assets free cash flow our capital expenditures  defined as purchases of property  equipment and software  net  and additions to other intangible assets  were approximately million  or of total revenues  million  or of total revenues  and million  or of total revenues  for fiscal years  and  respectively

the senior notes contain customary covenants including  but not limited to  restrictions on our ability  and the ability of our subsidiaries  to create or incur secured indebtedness  merge or consolidate with another person  or enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions 
upon the occurrence of certain events of default  the principal of  and all accrued and unpaid interest on  the senior notes may be declared due and payable by the trustee  the bank of new york trust company  na the trustee  or the holders of at least in principal amount of the outstanding senior notes 
such events of default include  but are not limited to  payment default  covenant defaults  material payment defaults other than under the senior notes and voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceedings 
as of june   we were in compliance with the covenants of our senior notes 
on september   we received a letter from cede co 
cede sent on behalf of certain holders of our senior notes due the senior notes issued by us under that certain indenture dated june  the indenture between us and trustee advising us that we were in default of our covenants 
the letter alleged that our failure to timely file our annual report on form k for the period ending june  by september   was a default under the terms of the indenture 
on september   we received a letter from cede sent on behalf of the same persons declaring an acceleration with respect to the senior notes  as a result of our failure to remedy the purported default set forth in the september  letter related to our failure to timely file our annual report on form k for the period ended june  the september  letter declared that the principal amount and premium  if any  and accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on the senior notes were due and payable immediately  and demanded payment of all amounts owed in respect of the senior notes 
on september  we received a letter from the trustee with respect to the senior notes 
the letter alleged that we were in default of our covenants under the indenture with respect to the senior notes  as the result of our failure to timely file our annual report on form k for the period ending june  on or before september  on october   we received a letter from the trustee declaring an acceleration with respect to the senior notes as a result of our failure to timely file our annual report on form k for the period ending june  on or before september  the october  letter declared the principal amount and premium  if any  and accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on the senior notes to be due and payable immediately  and demanded payment of all amounts owed in respect of the senior notes 
in addition  our senior notes due the senior notes were also issued under the indenture and have identical default and acceleration provisions as the senior notes 
on october   we received letters from certain holders of the senior notes issued by us under the indenture  advising us that we were in default of our covenants under the indenture 
the letters alleged that our failure to timely file our annual report on form k for the period ending june  by september   was a default under the terms of the indenture 
on november  and   we received letters from cede sent on behalf of certain holders of our senior notes  declaring an acceleration of the senior notes as the result of our failure to timely file our annual report on form k for the period ending june  the november  and  letters declared the principal amount and premium  if any  and accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on the senior notes to be due and payable immediately  and demanded payment of all amounts owed under the senior notes 

table of contents it is our position that no default has occurred under the indenture and that no acceleration has occurred with respect to the senior notes or the senior notes or otherwise under the indenture 
further we have filed a lawsuit against the trustee in the united states district court  northern district of texas  dallas division  seeking a declaratory judgment affirming our position 
on january   the court entered an order substituting wilmington trust company for the trustee 
on january   wilmington trust company filed an answer and counterclaim 
the counterclaim seeks immediate payment of all principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the senior notes 
alternatively  the counterclaim seeks damages measured by the difference between the fair market value of the senior notes on or about september  and par value of the senior notes 
unless and until there is a final judgment rendered in the lawsuit described above including any appellate proceedings  no legally enforceable determination can be made as to whether the failure to timely file our annual report on form k for the period ending june  is a default under the indenture as alleged by the letters referenced above 
if there is a final legally enforceable determination that the failure to timely file our annual report on form k for the period ending june  is a default under the indenture  and that acceleration with respect to the senior notes was proper  the principal and premium  if any  and all accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on the senior notes would be immediately due and payable 
in the event the claim of default against us made by certain holders of the senior notes is upheld in a court of law and we are required to pay off the senior notes  it is most likely that we would utilize the credit facility to fund such payoff 
under the terms of the credit facility  we can utilize borrowings under the revolving credit facility  subject to certain liquidity requirements  or may seek additional commitments for funding under the term loan facility of the credit facility 
we estimate we have sufficient liquidity to meet both the needs of our operations and any potential payoff of the senior notes 
while we do have availability under our credit facility to draw funds to repay the senior notes  there may be a decrease in our credit availability that could otherwise be used for other corporate purposes  such as acquisitions and share repurchases 
on december   we entered into an instrument of resignation  appointment and acceptance with the bank of new york trust company  na and wilmington trust company  whereby the bank of new york trust company  na resigned as trustee  as well as other offices or agencies  with respect to the senior notes  and was replaced by wilmington trust company 
if our senior notes are refinanced or the determination is made that the outstanding balance is due to the noteholders  the remaining unrealized loss on forward interest rate agreements reported in other comprehensive income of million million  net of income tax  unamortized deferred financing costs of million million  net of income tax and unamortized discount of million million  net of income tax associated with our senior notes as of june  may be adjusted and reported as interest expense in our consolidated statements of income in the period of refinancing or demand 
other credit arrangements certain contracts  primarily in our government segment  require us to provide a surety bond or a letter of credit as a guarantee of performance 
as of june   outstanding surety bonds of million and million of our outstanding letters of credit secure our performance of contractual obligations with our clients 
approximately million of letters of credit and million of surety bonds secure our casualty insurance and vendor programs and other corporate obligations 
in general  we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in our performance of our obligations under each contract  the probability of which we believe is remote 
we believe that we have sufficient capacity in the surety markets and liquidity from our cash flow and our credit facility to respond to future requests for proposals 
credit ratings following our tender offer completed in march  our credit ratings were downgraded by moody s and standard poor s  both to below investment grade 
standard poor s further downgraded us to bb upon our announcement in june of the approval by our board of directors of a new billion share repurchase plan 
fitch initiated its coverage of us in august at a rating of bb  except for our senior notes which were rated bb 
standard poor s downgraded our credit rating further  to b  following our announcement on september  that we would not be able to file our annual report on form k for the period ending june  by the september  extended deadline 
on march   standard poor s raised our credit rating to bb  reflecting the filing of our annual report on form k for the year ended june  and our quarterly report for the quarter ended september  on march   following the announcement that acs founder darwin deason and private equity fund cerberus have proposed to buy the company  all three agencies have placed acs on review for potential downgrade 
there may be additional reductions in our ratings depending on the timing and amounts that may be drawn under our credit facility 
as a result  the terms of any financings we choose to enter into in the future may be adversely affected 
in addition  as a result of these downgrades  the sureties which provide performance bonds 
table of contents backing our contractual obligations could reduce the availability of these bonds  increase the price of the bonds to us or require us to provide collateral such as a letter of credit 
however  we believe that we will continue to have sufficient capacity in the surety markets and liquidity from our cash flow and credit facility to respond to future requests for proposals 
in addition  certain of our commercial outsourcing contracts provide that  in the event our credit ratings are downgraded to certain specified levels  the customer may elect to terminate its contract with us and either pay a reduced termination fee or in some instances  no termination fee 
while we do not anticipate that the downgrading of our credit ratings will result in a material loss of commercial outsourcing revenue due to the customer s exercise of these termination rights  there can be no assurance that such a credit ratings downgrade will not adversely affect these customer relationships

share repurchase programs prior to the tender offer  our board of directors authorized three share repurchase programs totaling billion of our class a common stock 
on september   we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to million of our class a common stock  on april   we announced that our board of directors authorized a new  incremental share repurchase program of up to million of our class a common stock  and on october   we announced that our board of directors authorized an incremental share repurchase program of up to million of our class a common stock 
these share repurchase plans were terminated on january  by our board of directors in contemplation of our tender offer  which was announced january  and expired march  the programs  which 
table of contents were open ended  allowed us to repurchase our shares on the open market from time to time in accordance with sec rules and regulations  including shares that could be purchased pursuant to sec rule b the number of shares purchased and the timing of purchases was based on the level of cash and debt balances  general business conditions and other factors  including alternative investment opportunities  and purchases under these plans were funded from various sources  including  but not limited to  cash on hand  cash flow from operations  and borrowings under our credit facilities

a total of million shares with an average cost of approximately per share approximately million were purchased and retired in the first quarter of fiscal year no repurchases have been made under the august authorization as of the date of this filing 
if any additional repurchases are made  such repurchases would be funded from borrowings under our credit facility 
stock option repricing as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  as a result of our internal investigation into our stock option grant practices  we restated certain of our previously filed consolidated financial statements and recorded cumulative adjustments for non cash stock based compensation expense totaling million 
while these expenses are non cash  the amendment of the affected stock options and income tax related impacts have required and may continue to require the use of cash 
through june   we recorded approximately million of additional income taxes  estimated penalties and interest  net of the reversal discussed below  related to disallowed section m executive compensation deductions resulting from revised measurement dates 
at this time  we cannot predict when these section m issues will be resolved  however  during the third quarter of fiscal year  we paid approximately million of estimated income taxes  penalties and interest related to section m issues in order to reduce future interest that would accrue on the amounts of estimated taxes  penalties and interest 
this payment is reflected in cash flows from operating activities at june  during fiscal year  we reversed approximately million of accrued income taxes  penalties and interest associated with section m issues attributable to factors unrelated to revised measurement dates as we believe an accrual for these amounts is no longer required 
in december  we amended the exercise price of outstanding stock options of certain current executive officers  other executive officers and former executive officers in order to re price all or a portion of the respective option grant to the correct accounting measurement date to avoid adverse tax consequences to individual option holders under section a of the internal revenue code 
we will pay cash payments in the aggregate amount of million in accordance with the terms of the amendment  which will be paid in the third quarter of fiscal year from cash flows from operating activities 
of the million cash payment  approximately million was expensed in fiscal year  and the balance was charged to additional paid in capital 
if options are exercised  such exercise prices to be paid by option holders is expected to offset the related amounts of the cash payments related to those exercised options  however  the timing of any such exercises cannot be determined 
on june   we initiated a tender offer to amend certain options the eligible options to purchase an aggregate of  shares as amended of our class a common stock in order to re price all or a portion of the respective option grant to the correct accounting measurement date to avoid adverse tax consequences to individual option holders under section a of the internal revenue code

table of contents participants could elect to i amend eligible options to increase the exercise price per share to the fair market value of the company s class a common stock on the respective option s measurement date and ii receive a cash payment equal to the difference between the new exercise price per share of each amended option and the original exercise price per share of such amended option  multiplied by the number of unexercised shares of the company s class a common stock subject to such amended option 
this payment will be made on or before the eligible option holder s first regular payroll date in january the tender offer expired on july  pursuant to the offer  we accepted for amendment options to purchase  shares of our class a common stock  which represented of the shares of our class a common stock subject to all eligible options 
we will pay cash payments in the aggregate amount of million in accordance with the terms of the tender offer  which will be paid in the third quarter of fiscal year from cash flows from operating activities 
of the million cash payment  we anticipate that approximately million will be expensed  and the balance will be charged to additional paid in capital in the first quarter of fiscal year if options are exercised  such exercise prices to be paid by option holders is expected to offset the related amounts of the cash payments related to those exercised options  however  the timing of any such exercises cannot be determined 
in july  we notified former employees with vested  unexercised and outstanding options which had exercise prices per share that were less  or may have been less  than the fair market value per share of acs on the revised measurement dates for such options  as determined by us for accounting and tax purposes  that we will pay them the additional income tax imposed by section a based on the excess  if any  of the fair market value of our class a common stock up to per share on the date a triggering event occurs or condition exists that under section a results in the excess being recognized and reported as income on the former employee s w and the exercise price of the affected option reduced by any gain that had become subject to tax in a prior year because of an earlier triggering event 
we anticipate that these income tax reimbursements will be up to approximately million based on the current fair market value of our class a common stock on the exercise date and will be paid from cash flows from operating activities as the triggering event occurs for each option holder  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year in the first quarter of fiscal year  we will accrue the estimated charge related to these income tax reimbursements based on the current fair market value of our class a common stock and adjust the accrual each quarter until the options are exercised 
other at june   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at june  our working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities increased million to million at june  from million at june  our current ratio defined as total current assets divided by total current liabilities was at both june  and our debt to capitalization ratio defined as the sum of short term and long term debt divided by the sum of short term and long term debt and equity was and at june  and  respectively 
we believe that available cash and cash equivalents  together with cash generated from operations and available borrowings under our credit facility  will provide adequate funds for our anticipated internal growth and operating needs  including capital expenditures  and will meet the cash requirements of our contractual obligations 
however  due to the additional borrowings made in relation to our share repurchase programs and if we utilize the unused portion of our credit facility to repay the senior notes or for other corporate purposes  our indebtedness and interest expense would increase  possibly significantly  and our indebtedness could be substantial in relation to our stockholders equity 
should interest rates continue to rise  our interest expense could increase  possibly significantly  and impact our results of operations and cash flows 
we believe that our expected cash flow provided by operating activities  and anticipated access to the unused portion of our credit facility and capital markets will be adequate for our expected liquidity needs  including capital expenditures  and to meet the cash requirements of our contractual obligations 
in addition  we intend to continue our growth through acquisitions  which could require significant commitments of capital 
in order to pursue such opportunities we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future 
no assurance can be given as to our future acquisitions and expansion opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed 
related party transactions please see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations potential sale of the company above for a discussion of the proposal received from our chairman  darwin deason  and cerberus to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the company 
prior to we had guaranteed million of certain loan obligations owed to citicorp usa  inc by ddh aviation  inc  a corporate airplane brokerage company organized in as may have been reorganized subsequent to july  herein referred to as ddh 
our chairman owned a majority interest in ddh 
in consideration for that guaranty  we had access to 
table of contents corporate aircraft at favorable rates 
in july  our chairman assumed in full our guaranty obligations to citicorp and citicorp released in full our guaranty obligations 
as partial consideration for the release of our corporate guaranty  we agreed to provide certain administrative services to ddh at no charge until such time as ddh meets certain specified financial criteria 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  we purchased million in prepaid charter flights at favorable rates from ddh 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  we were notified by ddh of their intent to wind down operations  therefore  we recorded a charge of million related to the unused prepaid charter flights 
we made no payments to ddh during fiscal years  and previously  we reported that we anticipated that the administrative services we are providing to ddh would cease prior to june  as a result of the wind down of the ddh operations 
because of continuing activities related to the wind down of operations  the administrative services we are providing to ddh will continue until the wind down is complete 
during fiscal years  and  we purchased approximately million  million and million  respectively  of office products and printing services from prestige business solutions  inc  a supplier owned by the daughter in law of our chairman  darwin deason 
these products and services were purchased on a competitive bid basis in substantially all cases 
we believe this relationship has allowed us to obtain these products and services at quality levels and costs more favorable than would have been available through alternative market sources

table of contents we expect to contribute approximately million to our pension plans in fiscal year minimum pension funding requirements are not included in the table above as such amounts are zero for our pension plans as of june  please see critical accounting policies and note to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of our pension plans 
as discussed above  certain contracts  primarily in our government segment  require us to provide a surety bond or a letter of credit as a guarantee of performance 
as of june   outstanding surety bonds of million and million of our outstanding letters of credit secure our performance of contractual obligations with our clients 
approximately million of letters of credit and million of surety bonds secure our casualty insurance and vendor programs and other corporate obligations 
in general  we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in our performance of our obligations under each contract  the probability of which we believe is remote 
we believe that we have sufficient capacity in the surety markets and liquidity from our cash flow and our credit facility to respond to future requests for proposals 
we are obligated to make certain contingent payments to former shareholders of acquired entities upon satisfaction of certain contractual criteria in conjunction with certain acquisitions 
during fiscal years  and  we made contingent consideration payments of million  million and million  respectively  related to acquisitions completed in prior years 
as of june   the maximum aggregate amount of the outstanding contingent obligations to former shareholders of acquired entities is approximately million  of which million has been earned as of june  the million was accrued as of june  and is expected to be paid during the first half of fiscal year any such payments primarily result in a corresponding increase in goodwill 
we indemnified lockheed martin corporation against certain specified claims from certain pre sale litigation  investigations  government audits and other issues related to the majority of the federal business sold in november our contractual maximum exposure under these indemnifications is million  however  we believe the actual exposure to be significantly less 
as of june   other accrued liabilities include a reserve for these claims in an amount we believe to be adequate at this time 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we agreed to indemnify mantech international corporation with respect to the doj investigation related to purchasing activities at hanscom during the period our education services business  which is included in our commercial segment  performs third party student loan servicing in the federal family education loan program ffel on behalf of various financial institutions 
we service these loans for investors under outsourcing arrangements and do not acquire any servicing rights that are transferable by us to a third party 
at june   we serviced a ffel portfolio of approximately million loans with an outstanding principal balance of approximately billion 
some servicing agreements contain provisions that  under certain circumstances  require us to purchase the loans from the investor if the loan guaranty has been permanently terminated as a result of a loan default caused by our servicing error 
if defaults caused by us are cured during an initial period  any obligation we may have to purchase these loans expires 
loans that we purchase may be subsequently cured  the guaranty reinstated and then we repackage the loans for sale to third parties 
we evaluate our exposure under our purchase obligations on defaulted loans and establish a reserve for potential losses  or default liability reserve  through a charge to the provision for loss on defaulted loans purchased 
the reserve is evaluated periodically and adjusted based upon management s analysis of the historical performance of the defaulted loans 
as of june  and  other accrued liabilities include reserves which we believe to be adequate 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions or conditions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements involve significant judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition a significant portion of our revenue is recognized based on objective criteria that do not require significant estimates or uncertainties 
for example  transaction volumes and time and material and cost reimbursable arrangements are based on specific  objective criteria under the contracts 
accordingly  revenues recognized under these methods do not require the use of significant 
table of contents estimates that are susceptible to change 
revenue recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method does require the use of estimates and judgment as discussed below 
our policy follows the guidance from sec staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition sab  unless the transaction is within the scope of other specific authoritative guidance 
sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements and updates staff accounting bulletin topic to be consistent with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the services have been provided to the client  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
during fiscal year  approximately of our revenue was recognized based on transaction volumes  approximately was fixed fee based  wherein our revenue is earned as we fulfill our performance obligations under the arrangement  approximately was related to cost reimbursable contracts  approximately of our revenue was recognized using percentage of completion accounting and the remainder is related to time and material contracts 
our revenue mix is subject to change due to the impact of acquisitions  divestitures and new business 
revenues on cost reimbursable contracts are recognized by applying an estimated factor to costs as incurred  such factor being determined by the contract provisions and prior experience 
revenues on unit price contracts are recognized at the contractual selling prices of work completed and accepted by the client 
revenues on time and material contracts are recognized at the contractual rates as the labor hours and direct expenses are incurred 
revenues for business process outsourcing services are recognized as services are rendered  generally on the basis of the number of accounts or transactions processed 
information technology processing revenues are recognized as services are provided to the client  generally at the contractual selling prices of resources consumed or capacity utilized by our clients 
revenues from annual maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
revenues from hardware sales are recognized upon delivery to the client and when uncertainties regarding customer acceptance have expired 
revenues on certain fixed price contracts where we provide information technology system development and implementation services are recognized over the contract term based on the percentage of development and implementation services that are provided during the period compared with the total estimated development and implementation services to be provided over the entire contract using statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
sop requires the use of percentage of completion accounting for long term contracts that are binding agreements between us and our customers in which we agree  for compensation  to perform a service to the customer s specifications 
these services require that we perform significant  extensive and complex design  development  modification and implementation activities for our customers systems 
performance will often extend over long periods  and our right to receive future payment depends on our future performance in accordance with the agreement 
the percentage of completion methodology involves recognizing probable and reasonably estimable revenue using the percentage of services completed  on a current cumulative cost to estimated total cost basis  using a reasonably consistent profit margin over the period 
due to the longer term nature of these projects  developing the estimates of costs often requires significant judgment 
factors that must be considered in estimating the progress of work completed and ultimate cost of the projects include  but are not limited to  the availability of labor and labor productivity  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  and the impact of delayed performance 
if changes occur in delivery  productivity or other factors used in developing the estimates of costs or revenues  we revise our cost and revenue estimates  which may result in increases or decreases in revenues and costs  and such revisions are reflected in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision become known 
eitf addresses the accounting treatment for an arrangement to provide the delivery or performance of multiple products and or services where the delivery of a product or system or performance of services may occur at different points in time or over different periods of time 
eitf does not impact the use of sop for contract elements that fall within the scope of sop  such as the implementation or development of an information technology system to client specifications under a long term contract 
where an implementation or development project is contracted with a client  and we will also provide services or operate the system over a period of time  eitf provides the methodology for separating the contract elements and allocating total arrangement consideration to the contract elements but does not stipulate the revenue recognition methodology that should be applied to these separate elements 
in certain instances where revenue cannot be allocated to a contract element delivered earlier than other elements  costs of delivery are deferred and recognized as the subsequent elements are delivered 
costs deferred cannot exceed the relative fair value of the related element 
we adopted the provisions of eitf on a prospective basis for transactions entered into or modified after july  
table of contents revenues earned in excess of related billings are accrued  whereas billings in excess of revenues earned are deferred until the related services are provided 
we recognize revenues for non refundable  upfront implementation fees on a straight line basis over the period between the initiation of the ongoing services through the end of the contract term 
cost of revenues we present cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of income based on the nature of the costs incurred 
substantially all these costs are incurred in the provision of services to our customers 
the selling  general and administrative costs included in cost of revenues are not material and are not separately presented in the consolidated statements of income 
contingencies we account for claims and contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas 
sfas requires that we record an estimated loss from a claim or loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for claims and contingencies requires us to use our judgment 
we consult with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation and seek input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
our contracts with clients typically span several years 
we continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability 
if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur  a loss accrual is recorded in the consolidated financial statements in the period it is first identified 
circumstances that could potentially result in contract losses over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions  variances from expected costs to deliver our services  and other factors affecting revenues and costs 
valuation of goodwill and intangibles due to the fact that we are primarily a services company  our business acquisitions typically result in significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible expense we could incur as a result of an impairment 
in addition  in connection with our revenue arrangements  we incur costs to originate long term contracts and to perform the transition and setup activities necessary to enable us to perform under the terms of the arrangement 
we capitalize certain incremental direct costs which are related to the contract origination or transition  implementation and setup activities and amortize them over the term of the arrangement 
from time to time  we also provide certain inducements to customers in the form of various arrangements  including contractual credits  which are capitalized and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the term of the contract 
the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangibles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future business trends and growth 
in addition to our annual impairment testing  we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the balance of goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its underlying book value 
in evaluating intangible assets for impairment  we compare the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its underlying book value 
such evaluation is significantly impacted by estimates and assumptions of future revenues  costs and expenses and other factors 
if an event occurs which would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill or other intangible assets  such revision could result in a non cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results 
valuation of property  equipment and software we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the balance of our property  equipment and software may not be recoverable 
such evaluation is significantly impacted by estimates and assumptions of future revenues  costs and expenses and other factors 
if an event occurs which would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our property  equipment and software  such revision could result in a non cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results 
stock based compensation we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r as of july  sfas r requires us to recognize compensation expense for all stock based payment arrangements based on the fair value of the stock based payment on the date of grant 
we elected the modified prospective application method for adoption  which requires compensation expense to be recorded for all stock based awards granted after july  and for all unvested stock options outstanding as of july   beginning in the first quarter of adoption 
for all unvested options outstanding as of july   the remaining previously measured but unrecognized compensation expense  based on the fair value using revised grant dates as determined in connection with our internal investigation into our stock option grant practices please see note to our consolidated financial statements will be recognized as wages and benefits in the consolidated statements of income on a straight line basis over the remaining vesting period 
for stock based payment arrangements granted subsequent to july  
table of contents  compensation expense  based on the fair value on the date of grant  will be recognized in the consolidated statements of income in wages and benefits on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
in determining the fair value of stock options  we use the black scholes option pricing model that employs the following assumptions expected volatility of our stock price based on historical monthly volatility over the expected term based on daily closing stock prices 
expected term of the option based on historical employee stock option exercise behavior and the vesting and contractual terms of the respective option 
risk free interest rate for periods within the expected term of the option 
expected dividend yield 
our stock price volatility and expected option lives are based on management s best estimates at the time of grant  both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the black scholes methodology and  ultimately  the expense that will be recognized over the vesting term of the option 
sfas r requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of stock based payment arrangements that are expected to vest 
therefore  we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are based on historical employee termination behavior 
we periodically adjust the estimated forfeiture rates so that only the compensation expense related to stock based payment arrangements that vest are included in wages and benefits 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
pension and post employment benefits sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas  establishes standards for reporting and accounting for pension benefits provided to employees 
on june   we adopted sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas 
this statement requires recognition of the funded status of a defined benefit plan in the statement of financial position as an asset or liability if the plan is overfunded or underfunded  respectively 
changes in the funded status of a plan are required to be recognized in the year in which the changes occur  and reported in comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity 
further  certain gains and losses that were not previously recognized in the financial statements are required to be reported in comprehensive income  and certain disclosure requirements were changed 
sfas no 
also requires the measurement date of the plan s funded status to be the same as the company s fiscal year end 
there was no change to our june measurement date as a result of the adoption of sfas adoption of sfas resulted in an increase to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of approximately million  net of million deferred income tax

expected returns for the following asset classes used in the plans are based on a combination of long term historical returns and current and expected market conditions 
the uk pension scheme s target asset allocation is equity securities  debt securities and in real estate 
external investment managers actively manage all of the asset classes 
the target asset allocation has been set by the plan s trustee board with a view to meeting the long term return assumed for setting the employer s contributions while also reducing volatility relative to the plan s liabilities 
the managers engaged by the trustees manage their assets with a view to seeking moderate out performance of appropriate benchmarks for each asset class 
at this time  the trustees do not engage in any alternative investment strategies  apart from uk commercial property 
the canadian funded plan s target asset allocation is canadian provincial and corporate bonds  larger capitalization canadian stocks  developed and larger capitalization global ex canada stocks mainly us and international stocks and cash and cash equivalents 
a single investment manager actively manages all of the asset classes 
this manager uses an equal blend of large cap value and large cap growth for stocks in order to participate in the returns generated by stocks in the long term  while reducing year over year volatility 
the bonds are managed using a core approach where multiple strategies are engaged such as interest rate anticipation  credit selection and yield curve positioning to mitigate overall risk 
at this time  the manager does not engage in any alternative investment strategies 
the us pension plan s target asset allocation is large capitalization us equities  small capitalization us equities  developed market non us equities  long duration non us treasury bonds and in alternative investments

 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas requires the disclosure of assumed healthcare cost trend rates for next year used to measure the expected cost of benefits covered 
for measurement purposes  a composite annual rate of increase in the per capita costs of covered healthcare benefits was assumed for fiscal year  this rate was assumed to decrease gradually to by and remain at that level thereafter

we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends  and changes in our customer payment terms and collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
any change in the assumptions used in analyzing a specific account receivable may result in additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs 
income taxes the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates  and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions may be challenged and that we may not succeed 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances 
our provision for income taxes includes the impact of these reserve changes 
in the event that there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our operating results  the taxes attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or one time item 
deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which such differences are expected to reverse 
we routinely evaluate all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates  changes in market value of financial instruments caused by changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and fair market value of our investments 
sensitivity analysis is one technique available to measure the impact that changes in these rates could have on our results of operations or financial position 
the following analysis provides an indication of our sensitivity to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as of june  interest rates during fiscal year  we entered into a new credit agreement please see note to our consolidated financial statements for more discussion 
these new facilities are variable rate instruments and are subject to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in short term market interest rates 
if interest rates had increased by at june   and our june  credit facility debt had been outstanding for the entire fiscal year  net of million under our five year amortizing interest rate swap agreement discussed below  our results of operations would have decreased approximately million million  net of income tax 

table of contents in march  we entered into a five year amortizing interest rate swap agreement 
at june   the notional amount of the agreement was million 
the agreement is designated as a cash flow hedge of forecasted interest payments on up to million of outstanding floating rate debt under our credit facility 
the interest rate swap is structured such that we pay a fixed interest rate of  and receive a floating interest rate based on one month libor 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in short term market interest rates 
as of june   the fair value of the agreement is approximately million and reflects the termination cash value 
if interest rates were lower at june   the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement would be a liability of approximately million 
changes in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement would not affect our results of operations or cash flows unless terminated prior to maturity 
we entered into fixed rate senior notes during fiscal year the senior notes are subject to market risk from changes in interest rates 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in market interest rates 
the fair value of the senior notes as of june  and was million and million  respectively  based on quoted market prices 
if these rates were higher or lower at june   the fair value of the senior notes would be approximately million and million  respectively

foreign currency we conduct business in the u 
s 
and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non u 
s

risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in foreign currency rates against the us dollar 
if these rates were higher or lower at june   there would have been no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
we hedge the variability of a portion of our anticipated future mexican peso cash flows through foreign exchange forward agreements 
we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair value of our foreign exchange forward agreements 
the foreign exchange risk is computed based on the market value of the forward agreements as affected by changes in the corresponding foreign exchange rates 
the sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in the value of the foreign exchange forward agreements and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure 
fluctuations in the fair value of the foreign exchange forward agreements are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net
