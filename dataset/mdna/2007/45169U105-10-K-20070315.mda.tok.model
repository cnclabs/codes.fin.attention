critical accounting policies the following explains our most critical accounting policies 
see note to our consolidated financial statements set forth on pages to of this form k for a complete description of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on time and materials contracts as the services are performed 
time and materials contracts typically bill at an agreed upon hourly rate 
revenue is earned when our consultants are working on projects 
revenue recognition is negatively impacted by holidays and consultant vacation and sick days 
we also have fixed price arrangements with certain customers 
a price for an entire project is agreed upon for a predetermined fee before the project starts 
we recognize revenues on fixed price contracts using the proportional performance method 
we prepare a budget for each fixed price project  and based upon the budget that we prepare  we estimate what our costs should be 
we determine performance by comparing the actual cost of work performed to date to the estimated total cost for each contract 
we recognize revenue based upon costs incurred by our consultants during the period 
the company follows this revenue recognition method for fixed price contracts because there is a direct and consistent relationship between the service patterns and services provided to the customer and the direct costs incurred to provide such services 
if our cost estimates indicate a loss on a particular fixed price contract  we record a provision for the estimated loss without regard to the stage of completion 
changes in job performance  conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which the changes are identified 
certain contracts with no stated deliverables  with a designated workforce assigned  recognize revenues on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
revenue on these contracts is ratable and predetermined based upon the negotiated contract 
accounts receivable and allowance for uncollectible accounts we extend credit to clients based upon management s assessment of their creditworthiness 
the majority of our revenues and the resulting accounts receivable are from large companies and major systems integrators 
unbilled receivables represent amounts recognized as revenues for the periods presented based on services performed in accordance with the terms of client contracts that will be invoiced in subsequent periods 

table of contents we review accounts receivable periodically to determine the probability of loss 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts is determined using the combination of the specific identification method for balances deemed uncollectible  as well as judgments made by us based upon historical and expected charge off experience 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be necessary  which may impact earnings 
investments the company accounts for its investments in marketable equity securities in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
the company has determined that certain of its investments in marketable equity securities are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value  utilizing the investments closing price at each reporting period 
these investments are recorded on the balance sheet at market value  with the unrealized gains or losses  net of tax  reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of shareholders equity and comprehensive income loss 
the unrealized gain or loss is the difference between the company s original cost for an investment and the investment s fair value at each reporting period 
realized gains or losses on securities sold are calculated using the specific identification method 
if management determines that an investment in available for sale securities has sustained an other than temporary decline in its value  the investment is written down to its fair value  by a charge to earnings 
such evaluation is dependent on the specific facts and circumstances 
factors that are considered by the company in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value has occurred include the market value of the security in relation to its cost basis  the financial condition of the investee  and the intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the investment 
in evaluating these factors above  management presumes a decline in value to be other than temporary if the market price of the security is or more below the investment s cost basis for a period of six months or more the criteria 
however  the presumption of an other than temporary decline in these instances may be overcome if there is persuasive evidence indicating that the decline is temporary in nature eg  strong operating performance of investee  historical volatility of investee  etc additionally  there may be instances where impairment losses are recognized even if the criteria is not satisfied eg  plan to sell the security in the near term and the fair value is below the company s cost basis 
for investments accounted for using the cost or equity method of accounting  management evaluates information eg  budgets  business plans  financial statements  etc 
in addition to quoted market price  if any  in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value exists 
factors indicative of an other than temporary decline include recurring operating losses  credit defaults and subsequent rounds of financings at an amount below the cost basis of an investment 
this list is not all inclusive and management weighs all quantitative factors in determining if an other than temporary decline in value of an investment has occurred 
in  the company recorded an impairment of million on its investment in concours  inc there were no impairments recorded in or in goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually or as triggering events occur 
in making this assessment  we rely on a combination of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated cash flows and our current market value 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analyses of goodwill impairment 
under sfas  goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
estimated fair values of reporting units underlying the segments were estimated using either a discounted cash flow methodology  recent comparable 
table of contents transactions or a combination thereof 
for further discussions  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all stock based awards  using a fair value approach as prescribed in sfas no 
r share based payments 
the impact of the adoption is more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we record an estimated liability for income and other taxes based on what we determine will likely be paid in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts 
however  the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters  including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions  and may differ from the amounts recorded 
an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the amount recorded 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
when assessing the need for valuation allowances  we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years  we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs  along with a corresponding increase or charge to income 
use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
all of the estimates that we make in preparing our financial statements are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ from our estimates  which could impact our earnings

market risk factors we are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  especially the indian rupee rupee 
we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign exchange rate sensitivity igs s cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation between the rupee and usd 
this foreign currency risk exists based upon the nature of the igs s operations 
the majority of igs s customers and revenue are us based  which provides an inherent foreign currency risk between usd and rupee exchange rates 

table of contents we attempt to limit our exposure to changing rupee rates mainly through financial market transactions 
these transactions may include entering into forward or option contracts to hedge existing exposures 
the instruments are used to reduce risk by essentially creating offsetting currency exposures

substantially all of the company s foreign affiliates financial instruments are denominated in their respective functional currencies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate sensitivity the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its investing activities used to maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
the nature and amount of the company s long term and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
effect of hypothetical fluctuation in market prices our primary net foreign currency exposure is the rupee inr 
the fair value of foreign exchange contracts is subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of december   the potential gain or loss in the fair value of the company s outstanding foreign currency contracts assuming hypothetical  and fluctuations in currency rates would be approximately valuation given x decrease in rupee usd rate fair value as of december  valuation give x increase in rupee usd rate rupee to usd rate derivative instruments however  it should be noted that any change in the fair value of the contracts  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items 
in relation to currency contracts  this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the usd 
inflation we do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented 
on an ongoing basis  we attempt to minimize any effects of inflation on our operating results by controlling operating costs and whenever possible  seeking to insure that billing rates reflect increases in costs due to inflation

economic trends and outlook recent reporting data that focused on worldwide it spending indicates that the it industry is expected to grow year over year to total approximately billion through we are committed to the bpo market so evidenced by our construction of our whitefield campus  and our acquisitions that focused on serving the bpo market 
we believe we have the necessary infrastructure in place to take advantage of our opportunities in the bpo market 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as amended fin  an interpretation of sfas fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with this interpretation is a two step process 
the first step is recognition the enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  the enterprise should presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the effect of the provision of this statement on its consolidated financial statements 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb statement no 
fair value measurements fasb 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  but does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some entities  the application of this statement will change current practice 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
earlier application is encouraged  provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year  including financial statements for an interim period within that fiscal year 
the company is currently evaluating the effect of the provision of this statement on its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk short term investments are invested in highly liquid securities such as money market funds and certain corporate bonds with maturities of one year or less  and marketable equity securities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
we have also invested in one privately held company airweb  which can still be considered in the development stage 
this type of investment has an inherent risk as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
we could lose our entire remaining investment in this company 
the company s cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation 
foreign currency risk exists by nature of the company s global operations 
the company sells its services in a number of locations around the world  and hence foreign currency risk is diversified 
when appropriate  the company may attempt to limit its exposure to changing foreign exchange rates through both operational and financial market actions 
these actions may include entering into forward contracts to hedge existing exposures 
the instrument is used to reduce risk by essentially creating offsetting currency exposure 
substantially all of the company s foreign affiliates financial instruments are denominated in their respective functional currencies 
accordingly  exposure to exchange risk on foreign currency financial instruments is not material
