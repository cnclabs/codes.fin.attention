overview isramco  inc  a delaware corporation  is active in the exploration of oil and gas in israel and the united states 
isramco acts as an operator of certain leases and licenses and also holds participation interests in certain other interests 
isramco also holds certain non oil and gas properties discussed below 
critical accounting policies estimation of oil and gas reserves is important to the effective management of isramco 
they are integral to making investment decisions about oil and gas properties such as whether development should proceed or enhanced recovery methods should be undertaken 
oil and gas reserve quantities are also used as the basis of calculating the unit of production rates for depletion and evaluating for impairment 
oil and gas reserves are divided between proved and unproved reserves 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie  prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
unproved reserves are those with less than reasonable certainty of recoverability and are classified as either probable or possible 
the estimation of proved reserves is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations and extrapolations of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines 
although isramco is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced  the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects  reservoir performance  regulatory approvals and significant changes in long term oil and gas price levels 
the calculation of unit of production depletion is a critical accounting estimate that measures the depletion of upstream assets 
it is the ratio of actual volumes produced to total proved developed reserves those proved reserves recoverable through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods applied to the asset cost 
the volumes produced and asset costs are known and  while proved developed reserves have a high probability of recoverability  they are based on estimates that are subject to some variability 
isramco records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than is temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
isramco records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while isramco has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that isramco were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
isramco does not participate in  nor has it created  any off balance sheet special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing 
in addition  isramco does not enter into any derivative financial instruments other than the swap agreements 
isramco records a liability for asset retirement obligations at fair value in the period in which they are incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived assets 
liquidity and capital resources isramco finances its operations primarily from cash generated by operations 
isramco s operating activities provided used net cash of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the availability of cash generated by operations could be affected by other business risks discussed in the risk factors section of this annual report 
working capital current assets minus current liabilities was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the increase in working capital is primarily attributable to the purchase of oil and gas assets and participation in drilling of wells in the united states 
net cash provided by used in investing activities in fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal the increase in net cash used in investing activities in is primarily attributable to isramco s investments in the drilling of oil and gas wells in the united states offset by the increase in the value of marketable securities

as a result of the payments received under the settlement agreements  the company recorded a net gain of approximately  after payment of legal fees and other expenses during income taxes isramco recorded income tax expense of  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the primary difference from the statutory tax expense and the actual tax expense for results from intangible drilling costs incurred during that are fully deductible for tax purposes and are depleted for book purposes 
this is partially offset by the foreign income tax expense incurred for the foreign operations

recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for its measurement and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
we use fair value measurements to measure  among other items  purchased assets and investments  leases  derivative contracts and financial guarantees 
we also use them to assess impairment of properties  plants and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
the statement does not apply to share based payment transactions and inventory pricing 
this statement is effective january  we are currently evaluating the impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation provides guidance on recognition  classification  and disclosure concerning uncertain tax liabilities 
the evaluation of a tax position will require recognition of a tax benefit if it is more likely than not that it will be sustained upon examination 
this interpretation is effective beginning january  we are currently evaluating the impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk isramco is exposed to market risk  including adverse changes in commodity prices 
isramco produces and sells natural gas and crude oil 
as a result  isramco s financial results can be significantly affected if these commodity prices fluctuate widely in response to changing market forces 
isramco uses swap contracts to manage the risk on commodity prices 
isramco s positions are monitored and managed on a daily basis to ensure compliance with isramco s risk management policy 
the swap contracts are entered into principally with a major financial institution 
all derivatives are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income 
fair values are derived principally from market quotes and other independent third party quotes 
as of december   isramco had swap contracts to sell  barrels of crude oil during months commencing january for a total consideration of million  and swap contracts to sell  mmbtu of natural gas during months commencing january for a total consideration of million 
subsequent to balance sheet date  in january  isramco executed reverse contracts for most of the abovementioned contracts and remained with open swap contracts for  barrels of crude oil for a total consideration of million and  mmbtu of natural gas for a total consideration of million 
the above mentioned reverse of swap contracts generated to isramco a profit of million 
as at balance sheet date  each hypothetical increase in the price of natural gas would increase the liability of the natural gas derivative contracts by approximately million and  each hypothetical increase in the price of crude oil would increase the liability of the crude oil derivative contracts by approximately million 
hypothetical decrease in the prices of these commodities would result in the same opposite effects on the values of the contracts 
the hypothetical effect on these contracts was estimated by calculating the cash value of the contracts as the difference between the hypothetical and contract delivery prices multiplied by the contracts amounts
