item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information  including our financial statements and the notes thereto  which appears elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are the leading  and only international  company providing a make your own stuffed animal interactive entertainment experience under the build a bear workshop brand  in which our guests stuff  fluff  dress  accessorize and name their own teddy bears and other stuffed animals 
our concept  which we developed for mall based retailing  capitalizes on what we believe is the relatively untapped demand for experience based shopping as well as the widespread appeal of stuffed animals 
the build a bear workshop experience appeals to a broad range of age groups and demographics  including children  teens  their parents and grandparents 
as of december   we operated stores in the united states and canada  stores in the united kingdom and ireland  and had franchised stores operating in international locations under the build a bear workshop brand 
in addition to our stores  we market our products and build our brand through our website  which simulates our interactive shopping experience  as well as our non traditional store locations in major league baseball ballparks  a location in a zoo  and our presence at event based locations through our mobile store 
on april   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of the bear factory limited  a stuffed animal retailer in the united kingdom  and amsbra limited  our former uk franchisee 
the results of this acquisition s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since that date 
in conjunction with those transactions  we obtained retail locations in the united kingdom and ireland 
four of those locations closed during of those four locations  two closed due to overlapping store locations in the amsbra and bear factory portfolios  and the other two locations are concessions within department stores  which is a format that we have chosen not to continue at this point in the united kingdom 
we converted and rebranded bear factory stores to build a bear workshop stores in time for the holiday season  resulting in a unified company brand throughout the uk and ireland 
during the store conversion and rebranding process  stores were temporarily closed on average for days while many of the costs to operate the stores continue 
therefore  the acquisition was dilutive to earnings during fiscal the company hopes to improve sales performance and adopt best practices in the areas of merchandising  marketing  purchasing and store operations  across the acquired store base  and to realize earnings accretion from the acquisition in fiscal we operate in three segments that share the same infrastructure  including management  systems  merchandising and marketing  and generate revenues as follows company owned retail stores located in the united states  canada  the united kingdom and ireland  a webstore and seasonal  event based locations  international stores operated under franchise agreements  and license arrangements with third parties which manufacture and sell to other retailers merchandise carrying the build a bear workshop brand 
selected financial data attributable to each segment for fiscal   and are set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
for a discussion of the key trends and uncertainties that have affected our revenues  income and liquidity  see the revenues  costs and expenses and expansion and growth potential subsections of this overview 
we believe that we have developed an appealing retail store concept that  for stores open for the entire year  averaged million in fiscal and million in both fiscal and fiscal in net retail sales per store 
for a discussion of the changes in comparable store sales in fiscal years  and  see revenues 
store contribution  which consists of income before income tax expense  interest  store depreciation and amortization  store preopening expense and general and administrative expense  excluding franchise fees  income from licensing activities and contribution from our webstore and seasonal event based locations  as a percentage of net retail sales  excluding revenue from our webstore and seasonal and event based locations  was for and for fiscal  and total company net income as a percentage of total revenues was for fiscal  and for fiscal see non gaap financial measures for a reconciliation of store contribution to net income 
the store contribution of our 
table of contents average store  coupled with the fact that we have opened stores in the united states and canada since the beginning of fiscal have been the primary reasons for our net income increasing during each of the last five fiscal years 
additionally  as we have added stores and grown our sales volume  the quantities of merchandise and supplies we purchase have increased which has created economies of scale for our vendors allowing us to obtain reduced costs for these items and increase our profitability 
the increase in total store contribution has been partially offset by the increase in our central office general and administrative expenses required to support an expanding store base and international franchise operations 
these expenses have grown at a slower rate  in percentage terms  than our number of stores and net retail sales 
we expect to grow our business primarily through the continued opening of new stores 
further  we expect to increase our net retail sales  including comparable store sales  as a result of the continuation of national television and online advertising which we added to our marketing mix in fiscal we also plan to increase our revenues through increasing the number of international franchised stores  as well as the addition of new licensees and sales of licensed products for which we receive license revenue 
we expect to realize leverage on our national advertising programs as we expand and open stores in new markets 
we have been running national advertising since and believe that our brand awareness is higher and our entry into new markets is stronger as a result of the advertising and we expect to leverage these programs on an ongoing basis 
we expect to improve our store productivity as a result of comparable store sales improvement and thereby improve our store contribution as a percentage of net retail sales by better leveraging our store level operating expenses  primarily those which are fixed such as occupancy  over increased net retail sales per store 
as we grow our total revenues  we also expect to decrease our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues by leveraging these expenses  primarily those which are largely fixed such as management payroll and occupancy  over an increased revenue amount 
this decrease will be partially offset by some increases in general and administrative expenses  including marketing such as direct mail to support more stores and our growing international franchise business 
following is a description and discussion of the major components of our statement of operations revenues net retail sales net retail sales are revenues from retail sales including our webstore and seasonal and event based locations  are net of discounts  exclude sales tax  include shipping and handling costs billed to customers  and are recognized at the time of sale 
revenues from gift cards are recognized at the time of redemption 
our guests use cash  checks and third party credit cards to make purchases 
we classify stores as new or comparable stores and do not include our webstore or seasonal  event based locations in our store count or in our comparable store calculations 
stores enter the comparable store calculation in their thirteenth full month of operation 
we opened four additional friends b made locations in to bring the total number of friends b made locations to nine as of december  all but one of these locations are within or adjacent to a build a bear workshop store and share common store management  employees and infrastructure 
other than our stand alone store in ontario  california  these locations are considered expansions of the existing build a bear workshop store and are not considered an addition to our total store count 
the net retail sales of these expanded build a bear workshop stores are excluded from comparable store sales calculations until the thirteenth full month of operation after the date of the expansion 
we have an automated frequent shopper program in the united states  the stuff fur stuff club  whereby guests enroll in the program and receive one point for every dollar or partial dollar spent and after reaching points receive a discount on a future purchase 
this program was automated in july and replaced our former buy stuff program  which was a manual punch card system with limited tracking capability 
the reward earned under the new program did not change 
an estimate of the obligation related to the program  based on historical redemption rates  is recorded as deferred revenue and a reduction of net retail sales at the time of purchase 
the deferred revenue obligation is reduced  and a corresponding amount is recognized in net retail sales  in the amount of and at the time of redemption of the discount 
we account for changes in the deferred revenue account at the total company level only 
this is due to the fact that the frequent buyer discount can be earned or redeemed at any of our store locations 
therefore  when we refer to net retail sales by location  such as comparable stores or new stores  these amounts do not include any changes in the deferred revenue amount 
see critical accounting policies for additional details on the accounting for the deferred revenue program 

table of contents we use net retail sales per gross square foot and comparable store sales as performance measures for our business 
the following table details net retail sales per gross square foot by age of store for the periods presented fiscal fiscal fiscal net retail sales per gross square foot store age years stores in  stores in  stores in store age years stores in  stores in  stores in store age years stores in  stores in  stores in all comparable stores net retail sales per gross square foot represents net retail sales from stores open throughout the entire period divided by the total gross square footage of such stores 
as such  stores in the uk are excluded from the calculation 
calculated on an annual basis only 
excludes our webstore and seasonal and event based locations 
the percentage increase or decrease in comparable store sales for the periods presented below is as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal comparable store sales change store age years stores in  stores in  stores in store age years stores in  stores in  stores in store age years stores in  stores in  stores in total comparable store sales change comparable store sales percentage changes are based on net retail sales and stores are considered comparable beginning in their thirteenth full month of operation 
excludes our webstore and seasonal and event based locations 
our net retail sales per gross square foot are among the highest for specialty retailers 
historically  as a group our younger stores have performed at the highest sales per square foot level  above the chain wide average  despite experiencing comparable store sales pressures 
often our stores open with strong sales performance in their first year of operation and show comparable store sales declines in years two and three 
our older stores consistently perform the best on a comparable store sales basis and younger stores consistently generate the highest sales per square foot 
new stores typically pay for themselves in their first year of operation 
comparable store sales decreased by in fiscal following a decrease of in fiscal we believe these changes can be attributed primarily to the following factors changing customer preferences in contributed to the decline in comparable store sales 
our repeat customers  many of whom have built a sizable collection of build a bear workshop stuffed animals  have become more product discriminating 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  inventory shortfalls on products  specifically our special holiday animal mumble  impacted store performance 
demand was greater than we had anticipated and coupled with our customer s changing preferences contributed to a fourth quarter negative comparable store sales decrease of 
in  we saw improvement in our average transaction value per guest 
however  there was a decline in customer traffic during fiscal compared to due to the discretionary nature of our products  we believe that during much of comparable store sales were impacted by the more difficult macro economic conditions generally impacting customers 
comparable store sales decreased by in fiscal following an increase of in fiscal we believe these changes can be attributed primarily to the following factors our ongoing programs in advertising 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we tested in a limited number of markets the use of television and online advertising and determined that it was successful in attracting a higher number of new and repeat guests 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we implemented this marketing strategy on a national basis and quickly began achieving 
table of contents comparable store sales increases 
we continued this marketing approach throughout fiscal this approach was successful in maintaining our comparable store sales levels  but did not produce the increases that were achieved in fiscal when the change in the marketing program was an incremental addition to the prior year 
following an improved economy in  with higher levels of consumer confidence and a better retail climate  the economy showed mixed results in with varying levels of consumer confidence  record levels of crude oil prices and significant weather activity  particularly during the hurricane season 
franchise fees we receive an initial  one time franchise fee for each master franchise agreement which is amortized to revenue over the life of the respective franchise agreement  which extend for periods up to years 
master franchise rights are typically granted to a franchisee for an entire country or countries 
continuing franchise fees are based on a percentage of sales made by the franchisees stores and are recognized as revenue at the time of those sales 
as of december   we had stores  including opened in fiscal  operating under franchise arrangements in the following countries japan australia denmark taiwan other on april   we acquired all of the outstanding shares amsbra limited  our former uk franchisee 
amsbra operated all of the franchised build a bear workshop stores located in the united kingdom 
upon completion of the acquisition  all of the franchised locations in the united kingdom became company owned stores 
licensing revenue licensing revenue is based on a percentage of sales made by licensees to third parties and is recognized at the time the product is shipped by the licensee or at the point of sale 
we have entered into a number of licensing arrangements whereby third parties manufacture and sell to other retailers merchandise carrying the build a bear workshop trademark 
costs and expenses cost of merchandise sold and gross margin cost of merchandise sold includes the cost of the merchandise  royalties paid to licensors of third party branded merchandise  store occupancy cost  including store depreciation  freight costs from the manufacturer to the store  cost of warehousing and distribution  packaging  damages and shortages  and shipping and handling costs incurred in shipment to customers 
gross margin is defined as net retail sales less the cost of merchandise sold 
we have been able to reduce the unit costs of our merchandise and packaging through economies of scale realized as our sales volume has grown 
the increase in sales volume has also allowed us to reduce our freight  cost of warehousing and distribution costs as a percentage of net retail sales as a result of the cost efficiencies of shipping higher volumes of merchandise 
we expect to maintain these efficiencies in the future 
selling  general and administrative expense these expenses include store payroll and benefits  advertising  credit card fees  and store supplies  as well as central office general and administrative expenses  including management payroll  benefits  stock based compensation  travel  information systems  accounting  insurance  legal and public relations 
these expenses also include depreciation and amortization of central office leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment as well as the amortization of intellectual property costs 
central office general and administrative expenses have grown over time in order to support the increased number of stores in operation and we believe will continue to grow as we add stores  but we expect this increase to be at a lower rate than the percentage increase in total revenues 
advertising increased significantly with the introduction in fiscal of our national television and online advertising campaign 
we maintained the level of advertising expense as a percentage of net retail sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal and fiscal  and anticipate continuing this level of advertising expenditures in the future 
other store expenses such as credit card fees and supplies historically have increased or decreased proportionately with net retail sales 
we granted options during fiscal at an exercise price of per share  which had been determined to be the fair value of our common stock at the time based on an independent appraisal 
subsequent to such grants  we determined that the fair value of the underlying common stock should have been deemed to be approximately per share 
as a result of this determination  this option issuance generated stock based compensation of million to be recognized over the vesting period of the  underlying options issued 
these options became fully vested upon the completion of our initial public offering on october  accordingly  all unrecognized compensation expense related to this grant was recognized at that time and is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal as a component of selling  general and administrative expense 

table of contents on january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
the provisions of sfas r require that all share based payments to employees be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of the instruments issued 
sfas r requires the recognition of compensation expense related to instruments issued following adoption as well as to the non vested portion of instruments issued prior to adoption of the standard 
after the adoption of sfas r  we anticipate that our share based employee compensation will primarily consist of the granting of non vested stock which vests over a pre determined period of time assuming continued employment 
in the past  our share based employee compensation consisted primarily of stock option awards which vested over a pre determined period of time assuming continued employment 
in we recorded stock based compensation of approximately million million net of taxes in fiscal following the adoption of sfas r 
of this amount  million after tax is attributable to the company s adoption of sfas r 
this incremental expense from the adoption of sfas r did not reduce basic or diluted earnings per share based upon the insignificance of the expense 
the additional stock based compensation expense not related to the adoption of sfas r was related to the vesting of restricted stock awards 
in  we recorded stock based compensation of approximately million million net of tax 
store preopening preopening costs are expensed as incurred and include store set up  certain labor and hiring costs  and rental charges incurred prior to a store s opening 
expansion and growth potential company owned stores the number of build a bear workshop stores in the united states  canada  united kingdom  and ireland for the last three fiscal years can be summarized as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal beginning of period uk acquisition opened closed end of period on april  the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of the bear factory limited bear factory  a stuffed animal retailer in the united kingdom  and amsbra limited amsbra  the company s former uk franchisee collectively  the uk acquisition 
in conjunction with those transactions  we obtained retail locations in the united kingdom and ireland 
four of those locations closed during of those four locations  two closed due to overlapping store locations in the amsbra and bear factory portfolios  and the other two locations are concessions within department stores  which is a format that we have chosen not to continue at this point in the united kingdom 
we opened two new store locations in the united kingdom in fiscal in fiscal  we anticipate opening build a bear workshop stores in the united states and canada and to stores in the united kingdom and ireland 
we believe there is a market potential for at least build a bear workshop stores in the united states and canada and to stores in the united kingdom and ireland 
in fiscal  we began testing in certain markets our initial brand expansion initiative  our proprietary friends b made line of make your own dolls and related products

in fiscal  we opened three additional locations in or adjacent to new or existing build a bear workshop stores and one stand alone friends b made store in ontario  california 
other than the one stand alone store  the friends b made stores are not included in the number of store openings in fiscal  or as noted above but rather are considered expansions of build a bear workshop stores 
the friends b made merchandise is also offered from a separate display fixture in select build a bear workshop stores 
non store locations in we began offering merchandise in seasonal  event based locations such as major league baseball ballparks  as well as at temporary locations such as at the nba all star jam session 
we expect to expand our future presence at select seasonal  event based locations contingent on their availability 
as of the end of december  we had a total of five ballpark locations 
we also opened up our first store in a zoo during fiscal 
table of contents international franchise revenue our first franchisee location was opened in november the number of international  franchised stores opened and closed for the periods presented below can be summarized as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal beginning of period uk acquisition opened closed end of period as of december   we had master franchise agreements  which typically grant franchise rights for a particular country or countries  covering countries 
we anticipate signing additional master franchise agreements in the future 
we expect our current and future franchisees to open to stores in fiscal we believe there is a market potential for approximately franchised stores outside of the united states  canada  the united kingdom  and ireland 
in april  we acquired amsbra limited  our former franchisee in the united kingdom 
amsbra owned all franchised build a bear workshop stores in the united kingdom 
upon completion of the transaction  all of the franchised locations in the united kingdom became company owned stores 
licensing revenue in fiscal  we began entering into license agreements pursuant to which we receive royalties on build a bear workshop brand products

store contribution consists of income before income tax expense  interest  store depreciation and amortization  store preopening expense and general and administrative expense  excluding franchise fees  income from licensing activities and contribution from our webstore and seasonal and event based locations 
this term  as we define it  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and is not a measure of performance presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we use store contribution as a measure of our stores operating performance 
store contribution should not be considered a substitute for net income  net income per store  cash flows provided by operating activities  cash flows provided by operating activities per store  or other income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with gaap 
we believe store contribution is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because it  along with the number of stores in operation  directly impacts our profitability 
historically  central office general and administrative expenses and preopening expenses have increased at a rate less than our total net retail sales increases 
therefore  as we have opened additional new stores and leveraged our central office general and administrative and preopening expenses over this larger store base and sales volume  we have been able to increase our net income each year

table of contents our operating results for one period may not be indicative of results for other periods  and may fluctuate significantly because of a variety of factors  including those discussed under risk factors fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations could cause the price of our common stock to substantially decline 
the timing of new store openings may result in fluctuations in quarterly results as a result of the revenues and expenses associated with each new store location 
we typically incur most preopening costs for a new store in the three months immediately preceding the store s opening 
we expect our growth  operating results and profitability to depend in some degree on our ability to increase our number of stores 
for accounting purposes  the quarters of each fiscal year consist of weeks  although we will have a week quarter approximately once every six years 
quarterly fluctuations and seasonality may cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause our stock price to fall 
liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements are primarily for the opening of new stores  information systems and working capital 
historically  we have met these requirements through capital generated from the sale and issuance of our securities to private investors and through our initial public offering  cash flow provided by operations and our revolving line of credit 
from our inception to december  we raised at various times a total of million in capital from several private investors 
in  we raised million from the initial public offering of our common stock 
from fiscal to fiscal  cash flows provided by operating activities have exceeded cash flows used in investing activities 
operating activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash flow from operating activities decreased in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to increased cash outflows for inventories offset by the timing of cash payments on accounts payable and accrued expenses 
additionally  the adoption of sfas r led to the reclassification of the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options from operating activities to financing activities 
this caused the impact of this line item on cash flows to decrease by million 
cash flow from operating activities increased in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to increases in net income adjusted for the impact of depreciation and amortization 
investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash used in investing activities during fiscal relates primarily to the uk acquisition for million  the construction of our company owned distribution center for approximately million  and new stores

in fiscal  we completed our initial public offering which resulted in cash inflows  net of offering costs  of million 
the financing cash inflows from the initial public offering were partially offset by the payment of a special cash dividend in august of million 
capital resources 
as of december   we had a cash balance of million 
we also have a line of credit  which we can use to finance capital expenditures and seasonal working capital needs throughout the year 
the credit agreement is with us bank  national association and was amended effective june  to include a seasonal overline from july to december each year during which the line availability increases from million to million 
borrowings under the credit agreement are not collateralized  but availability under the credit agreement can be limited by the vendor based on our level of accounts receivable  inventory  and property and equipment 
the credit agreement expires on september  and contains various restrictions on indebtedness  liens  guarantees  redemptions  mergers  acquisitions or sale of assets  loans  transactions with affiliates  and investments 
it also prohibits us from declaring dividends without the bank s prior consent  unless such payment of dividends would not violate any terms of the loan agreement 
borrowings bear interest at our option of prime minus or libor plus 
financial covenants include maintaining a minimum tangible net worth  maintaining a minimum fixed charge cover ratio as defined in the credit agreement and not exceeding a maximum funded debt to earnings before interest  depreciation and amortization ratio 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
there were no borrowings under our line of credit as of december  there was a standby letter of credit of approximately million outstanding under the credit agreement as of december  accordingly  there was approximately million available for borrowing under the line of credit as of december  
table of contents most of our retail stores are located within shopping malls and all are operated under leases classified as operating leases 
our leases in north america typically have a ten year term and contain provisions for base rent plus percentage rent based on defined sales levels 
many of the leases contain a provision whereby either we or the landlord may terminate the lease after a certain time  typically in the third to fourth year of the lease  if a certain minimum sales volume is not achieved 
in addition  some of these leases contain various restrictions relating to change of control of our company 
our leases also subject us to risks relating to compliance with changing mall rules and the exercise of discretion by our landlords on various matters  including rights of termination in some cases 
our leases in the uk typically have terms of years and generally contain a provision whereby every fifth year the rental rate can be adjusted to reflect the current market rates 
the leases typically provide the lessee with the first right for renewal at the end of the lease 
we may also be required to make deposits and rent guarantees to secure new leases as we expand 
real estate taxes also change according to government time schedules to reflect current market rental rates for the locations we lease 
in fiscal  we expect to spend a total of to million on capital expenditures 
capital spending in fiscal totaled million 
capital spending in fiscal was primarily for the construction of our new distribution center  the opening of new stores in north america and two in the united kingdom  the re branding of stores in the united kingdom  and the continued installation and upgrades of central office information technology systems 
in fiscal  the average investment per new store  which includes leasehold improvements  fixtures  equipment and inventory  was approximately million 
we anticipate the investment per store in fiscal will be approximately the same as fiscal on february   we announced a million share repurchase program of our outstanding common stock over the next twelve months 
the program was authorized by our board of directors 
purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  with the level and timing of activity depending on market conditions  other investment opportunities  and other factors 
purchases may be increased  decreased or discontinued at any time without notice 
as of march   approximately  shares at an average price of per share have been repurchased under this program 
future repurchases will be reported in our quarterly and annual reports under item on a monthly basis 
we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will be sufficient to fund our working capital and other cash flow requirements for at least the next months 
our credit agreement expires on september  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any arrangements classified as off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments our contractual obligations and commercial commitments include future minimum obligations under operating leases and purchase obligations 
our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise inventory  construction commitments related to our new distribution center and obligations associated with building out our stores 
the future minimum payments for these obligations as of december  for periods subsequent to this date are as follows payments due by fiscal period as of december  total beyond in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations total inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented 
we cannot assure you  however  that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies which are described below 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on an average cost basis 
historically  we have not conducted sales whereby we offer significant discounts or markdowns  nor have we experienced significant occurrences of obsolete or slow moving inventory 
however  future changes in circumstances  such as changes in guest merchandise preference  could cause reclassification of inventory as obsolete or slow moving inventory 
the effect of this reclassification would be the recording of a reduction in the value of inventory to realizable values 
throughout the year we record an estimated cost of shortage based on past historical results 
periodic physical inventories are taken and any difference between the actual physical count of merchandise and the recorded amount in our records are adjusted and recorded as shortage 
historically  the timing of the physical inventory has been near the end of the fiscal year so that no material amount of shortage was required to be estimated on activity between the date of the physical count and year end 
however  future physical counts of merchandise may not be at times at or near the end of a fiscal quarter or fiscal year end  and our estimate of shortage for the intervening period may be material based on the amount of time between the date of the physical inventory and the date of the fiscal quarter or year end 
long lived assets if facts and circumstances indicate that a long lived asset  including property and equipment  may be impaired  the carrying value is reviewed 
if this review indicates that the carrying value of the asset will not be recovered as determined based on projected undiscounted cash flows related to the asset over its remaining life  the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its estimated fair value 
no long lived assets were impaired in fiscal   or in fiscal  we determined that one store which had been designated for closure would remain open 
this determination resulted in the reversal of million in impairment charges taken in fiscal for costs to be incurred upon the closing of the store 
impairment losses in the future are dependent on a number of factors such as site selection and general economic trends  and thus could be significantly different than historical results 
to the extent our estimates for net sales  gross profit and store expenses are not realized  future assessments of recoverability could result in additional impairment charges 
goodwill and other intangibles the company has adopted sfas no 
under the provisions of this standard  intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives and goodwill are not subject to amortization 
all other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
this testing requires comparison of carrying values to fair values  and when appropriate  the carrying value of impaired assets is reduced to fair value 
we reviewed our goodwill and other intangible assets as of december  and determined that no impairment existed 
revenue recognition revenues from retail sales  net of discounts and excluding sales tax  are recognized at the time of sale 
guest returns have not been significant 
revenues from gift certificates are recognized at the time of redemption 
unredeemed gift cards are included in current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents we have an automated frequent shopper program in the united states  the stuff fur stuff club  whereby guests enroll in the program and receive one point for every dollar or partial dollar spent and after reaching points receive a discount on a future purchase 
this program was automated in july and replaced our former buy stuff program  which was a manual punch card system with limited tracking capability 
the reward earned under the new program did not change 
an estimate of the obligation related to the program  based on historical redemption rates  is recorded as deferred revenue and a reduction of net retail sales at the time of purchase 
the deferred revenue obligation is reduced  and a corresponding amount is recognized in net retail sales  in the amount of and at the time of redemption of the discount 
under the previous buy stuff program  the first card had no expiration date 
beginning in june  and continuing each summer up to july   a series of cards was issued that had an expiration date of december of the year following the year in which that series of cards was first issued 
beginning in july  the automated stuff fur stuff club was introduced which provides greater visibility to the rewards earned by our guests and the historical redemption rates 
we track redemptions of these various cards and use actual redemption rates by card series and historical results to estimate how much revenue to defer 
we review these redemption rates and assess the adequacy of the deferred revenue account at the end of each fiscal quarter 
due to the estimates involved in these assessments  adjustments to the deferral rate are generally made no more often than bi annually in order to allow time for more definite trends to emerge 
based upon an assessment at the end of fiscal  the deferred revenue account was adjusted downward by million with a corresponding increase to net retail sales  an increase in net income of million 
additionally  the amount of revenue being deferred beginning in fiscal was decreased by  and by another beginning with the third quarter of  to give effect to the change in redemption experience 
the changes made to the deferral rate in fiscal were prospective in nature with no impact on previously reported results of operations 
beginning with the second quarter of fiscal  the amount of revenue being deferred was reduced by on a prospective basis from its then current level due to further changes in the company s redemption experience 
based on the most recent assessment at the end of fiscal  the deferred revenue account was adjusted downward by million  effective at the beginning of fiscal  with a corresponding increase to net sales  and a million increase in net income 
additionally  the amount of revenue being deferred for future periods has been decreased by  to give effect to the change in redemption experience and the increased visibility of the redemptions with the automated system 
an additional adjustment of the ultimate redemption rate at the end of fiscal for the current cards expiring on december  and december  would have an approximate impact of million on the deferred revenue balance and net retail sales 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin establishes threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement measurement and recognition of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt fin on december  we do not expect the adoption of fin will have a significant impact on the financial results of the company and will not result in a significant cumulative effect adjustment to the december  balance of retained earnings 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and states that a fair value measurement should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
we are required to adopt sfas in the first quarter of we are currently assessing the financial impact of sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates  and we bear this risk in two specific ways 
first  our revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices and  therefore  our results of operations and our cash flows can be impacted by changes in interest rates 
outstanding balances under our credit facility bear interest at our option of prime minus or libor plus 
we had no borrowings outstanding during fiscal accordingly  a basis point change in interest rates would result in no material change to our annual interest expense 
the second component of interest rate risk involves the short term investment of excess cash in short term  investment grade interest bearing securities 
these investments are considered to be cash equivalents and are shown that way on our balance sheet 
if there are changes in interest rates  those changes would affect the investment income we earn on these investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations
