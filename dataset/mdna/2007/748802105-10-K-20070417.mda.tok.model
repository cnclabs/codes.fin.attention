item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview goodwill impairment  valuation allowance as described in more detail in notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in this report and under critical accounting estimates in this item  we have recorded a goodwill impairment charge of  and a valuation allowance of  against our deferred tax assets 
approximately  of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance relates to the goodwill impairment charge and did not further increase our net loss 
while the impairment charge and valuation allowance adversely affected our results of operations  they had no effect on our balances of cash or securities available for sale 
in addition  the impairment charge and the valuation allowance will not result in any future cash expenditures 
newspaper industry considerations our financial performance reflects  to a meaningful extent  conditions in the newspaper industry 
we believe that our customers spending for capital investment  and therefore  demand for our equipment  is affected by fluctuations in advertising revenue and newsprint cost 
specifically  we believe the growth in our business is somewhat reflective of the growth in newspaper advertising revenues  offset by any increases in newsprint costs 
similarly  we believe that a decline or a very weak growth pattern in advertising revenues generally will adversely affect capital equipment spending by newspapers and  as a result  will adversely affect our financial performance 
on a longer term basis  we believe that capital investment patterns have been  and will continue to be  affected by reduction in newspaper circulation and industry consolidation 
according to published reports  daily newspaper circulation in the united states has decreased by an average of approximately each year from to additionally  according to statistics from the audit bureau of circulation  daily newspaper circulation decreased approximately in compared to and declined for the six months ending september  compared to the same period in we expect the trend of decreasing circulation to continue as newspapers compete with other media including the internet  direct mail  television and radio 
while reduced circulation could negatively affect demand for our products  we believe the consolidation of newspaper ownership in recent years has had a positive impact on our business 
i n many cases  when large newspaper and media groups have acquired small newspapers and newspaper chains  the acquiring groups centralize the production and distribution of multiple newspapers located in a geographic area to one or a few sites 
the operation of centralized production and distribution facilities typically requires the purchase of additional automated equipment 
therefore  consolidation could enhance demand for our products 
based on published financial reports and discussions with our customers  we believe that major newspaper chains generally derive over of their revenues from advertising 
statistics obtained from the newspaper association of america naa indicate that newspaper advertising revenue decreased during the year ended december  compared to the same period in management believes that the pressure on newspaper advertising revenues will continue due to competition for advertising dollars by other media 
nevertheless  statistics available from naa indicate that  in which we believe are the most recent statistics available  us newspaper advertising revenue amounted to billion  continuing to rank newspapers second behind direct mail billion and ahead of broadcast television billion in the allocation of advertising dollars 
despite published reports of significant advertisin g revenue gains achieved by the internet  non newspaper internet advertising revenues remain well below traditional media  amounting to billion in based on public filings of newspaper chains  newsprint represents a significant operating expense for newspaper publishers 
newsprint prices increased steadily during but declined in late and early in an effort to reduce costs  many of our customers are reducing their newsprint consumption by changing to smaller web widths and lighter newsprint weight 
accordingly  management expects that newsprint prices will have only a moderate effect on capital spending demands of newspaper publishers in effect of contract terms on cash generation  revenue recognition most of our sales are made on a contract basis 
a typical sales contract requires a customer to pay for its purchase in installments as follows due at the time of the order  due days prior to shipment  due days prior to shipment  due upon installation and due upon acceptance 
contract payment terms vary for some orders and may be based on our achievement of agreed upon milestones 
while cash is collected throughout the order process  revenue is recognized only when all significant contract obligations are satisfied and collection of outstanding receivables are reasonably assured in accordance with our revenue recognition policy see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we normally receive larger orders several months in advance of delivery 
therefore  backlog can be an important  though by no means conclusive  indication of our short term revenue stream 
the timing of revenues can be affected by pending orders  the amount of custom engineering required  the timetable for delivery  the time required to complete installation and the receipt of new orders 
our backlog  as of december  and december  was  and  respectively 
we expect to ship all orders in our december  backlog within months 
results of operations vs 
net sales of the  in net sales  we generated  from our inserter product line acquired with the purchase of newstec in august of the  in net sales  we generated  from our newstec inserter product line 
the balance of  in net sales decreased  compared to the balance of net sales of  published reports indicate that us newspaper publishers and media groups have recently been experiencing lower profits in their newspaper divisions due to declining circulation  flat or reduced print advertising revenue and higher costs 
we believe these developments have resulted in lower capital spending on post press newspaper manufacturing equipment  which has adversely affected our incoming orders and net sales 
sales to foreign customers were  in compared to  in most of our foreign sales are made to customers located in countries where post press equipment specifications are similar to those in the u 
s  principally newspapers in canada  central america and south america 
because opportunities to sell our equipment overseas are not consistent  sales to foreign customers can fluctuate significantly from year to year 
gross profit gross profit for was  an increase of  as compared to  for the corresponding period in gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in in  our profit as a percentage of net sales was adversely affected by a nominal profit earned on revenue of approximately  for a complex system project 
additionally  our gross profit percentage was negatively affected by low manufacturing volumes at our newstec massachusetts production facility  from august  to december   resulting in unfavorable overhead absorption 
the profit margin percentage was also adversely affected by the purchase accounting write up of newstec inventory on the date of acquisition 
the inventory was written up to fair value on the date that we acquired newstec  resulting in increased cost of sales of approximately  in upon recognition of the related revenue 
goodwill impairment pursuant to sfas no  we tested goodwill in the fourth quarter of and determined that the fair value of quipp was less than the carrying value 
therefore  we calculated the implied fair value of the company s goodwill  which resulted in an impairment charge of selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses were  an increase of   compared to  for the same period in selling  general and administrative costs related to the inserter product line we acquired from newstec were approximately  including  of intangible amortization expense compared to  including  of intangible amortization expense from august  through december  additionally  we incurred higher marketing costs in for our annual nexpo show 
these higher costs were offset in part by lower costs for activities related to compliance requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations 
in we also settled a matter with the export import bank of the united states related to a dispute arising from the sale of equipment to a foreign customer in the amount of the settlement was less than the cost that was estimated and accrued  and  as a result  we recorded an adjustment of  as a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses in research and development research and development expenses for were  an increase of  as compared to  for the same period in during  we focused most of our research and development resources to hardware and software enhancements to our quipp newstec inserter product line 
in  we completed the testing of the quipp packman packaging system and our in line c inserting collating system with poly wrapping capabilities and we commenced development of software controls for both quipp and newstec products 
other income and expense net net other income and expense in was  as compared to  of income for the same period in royalty income relating to our patented automatic cart loading system technology used by another supplier of post press material handling equipment was  in compared to  during the same period in interest income increased to  in from  in our interest income was greater in principally due to higher interest rates offset  in part  by lower balances of cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale 
interest expense was greater in due to higher interest rates and due to amortization of loan costs related to our line of credit which was available for the full year in compared to seven months in income tax benefit expense our income tax expense reflects a deferred tax valuation allowance of  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in  we generated  tax benefit due to an adjustment in current and deferred state tax liabilities as a result of settlements of tax obligations with several states for amounts that were less than estimated and accrued 
results of operations vs 
net sales of the  in net sales  we generated  from our inserter product line acquired with the purchase of newstec in august the balance of the net sales totaling  decreased  compared to net sales of  the decrease was due mostly to lower sales volume of manufactured products including stackers  bottomwrappers and conveyor equipment  offset in part by an increase in oem and installation revenue 
the higher volume of oem and installation revenue was due in part to the recognition of approximately  in revenue relating to a complex system order that was manufactured and shipped to our customer in and sales to foreign customers were  in compared to  in most of our foreign sales are made to customers located in countries where equipment specifications are similar to those in the u 
s  principally newspapers in canada  central america and south america 
because opportunities to sell our equipment overseas are not consistent  sales to foreign customers fluctuate from year to year 
gross profit of the  gross profit in   was generated by our newly acquired inserter product line 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales amounted to on the newly acquired product line following the acquisition in august the gross profit percentage was adversely affected by low manufacturing volumes at our walpole  massachusetts facility  resulting in unfavorable overhead absorption 
due to the low volume of inserter orders scheduled to ship from august to december  we accelerated the relocation of our newly acquired inserter operations from massachusetts to our miami  florida facility and closed the walpole facility 
the relocation was completed by march  the profit margin percentage for our newly acquired inserter product line was also adversely affected by the purchase accounting write up of inventory on the date of acquisition 
in other words  the inventory was written up to fair value on the date that we acquired newstec 
the purchase accounting adjustment resulted in increased cost of sales by approximately  upon recognition of the related revenue 
the balance of our gross profit was  a decrease of  compared to gross profit of  for the corresponding period in gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to in from in  mostly due to an improved sales mix resulting from lower volume of complex system projects in compared to we generally expect margins on complex systems projects to be lower than margins on discrete product sales due to competitive pricing pressures  system complexity and additional customization requirements 
in addition  cost of sales in reflected the rework of a gripper conveyor system that was later returned by the customer 
the improved gross profit margin was partially offset by a nominal profit earned on revenue of approximately  for a complex system project recognized during the first quarter of the order for this system was negotiated in w hen our market was just beginning to show signs of recovery 
we expected lower margins on this order due not only to the factors described above  but also because it included a high content of equipment manufactured by others 
additionally  in  our manufacturing plant in miami was shut down for eleven days following hurricanes katrina and wilma  resulting in added facilities and property maintenance costs coupled with production start up inefficiencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses of the  in selling  general and administrative expenses for   was incurred by our acquired operations in walpole  massachusetts 
the balance of our selling  general and administrative expenses amounted to  a decrease of  as compared to  for during the third quarter  we settled a matter with the export import bank of the united states exim bank related to a dispute arising from the sale of equipment to a foreign customer in the settlement with the exim bank was less than the cost estimated and accrued  and  as a result  we recorded a  reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses 
additionally  due to lower sales volume  we incurred lower variable selling costs including commissions and warranty expense 
the reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses was offset in part by higher expenses related to compliance requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations 
research and development research and development expenses for were  a decrease of  as compared to  in in  we continued to develop and test our in line c inserting collating system with poly wrapping capabilities and commenced development of new controls for some of our equipment 
in  we focused much of our research and development efforts on our new in line c inserting collating system with poly wrapping capabilities 
additionally  we expended research and development resources to redesign our gripper conveyor to enhance the performance of the product in certain applications  and completed the software for the quipp packman packaging system 
in  we focused much of our engineering and technical efforts on the development of the quipp packman packaging system 
other income and expense net other income and expense net in was  as compared to  for the same period in royalty income relating to our patented automatic cart loading system technology used by another supplier of post press material handling equipment decreased to  in compared to  during the same period in interest income decreased to  in from  in our interest income was lower in due to lower balances of cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale after we expended approximately  for newstec  partially offset by increases in interest rates 
in addition  we recognized interest income in related to repayment of a note from an international customer who previously was delinquent in making payment 
interest expense was greater in primarily due to amortization of loan costs associated with our line of credit 
income tax benefit expense income taxes for were reduced by  in the third quarter 
the reduction was due to an adjustment in current and deferred state tax liabilities as a result of settlements of tax obligations with several states for amounts that were less than estimated and accrued 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale decreased by  at december  compared to the same date in the previous year 
during  capital expenditures were higher than in recent years as we purchased new computer hardware for approximately  additionally  we paid four dividends totaling per share each quarter or  in representing the first full year of dividend payments in company history 
the balance of the reduction in cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale relates to reduced level of installment payment collections resulting from the lower volume of incoming orders 
we currently have a line of credit agreement with merrill lynch business financial services  inc merrill lynch 
as of the date of this report  we have no balance on the line of credit 
under the terms of the agreement  we can borrow up to  subject to a limit based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
borrowings are secured by all accounts receivable  inventory  intangibles and contract rights as well as securities with value of no less than  interest is payable monthly at a rate equal to the one month libor rate plus 
at december   we did not meet the debt covenants required by the agreement and received a waiver from merrill lynch through the agreement expiration date  april  the line of credit is subject to renewal based on terms in the agreement 
while merrill lynch has expressed an interest in renewing the line of credit facility  there is no assurance we will be ab le to retain the line of credit or maintain the same terms as in the current agreement 
our long term debt consists primarily of obligations under variable rate industrial revenue bonds that were issued through the dade county industrial development authority in at december   the balance due on the bonds was  of which  is classified as a current liability on our balance sheet 
during  the bonds bore interest at an average rate of 
the following table provides information relating to certain of our material contractual obligations at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years more than years employment agreements building lease purchase commitments equipment lease auto loan industrial revenue bonds working capital at december  was  a decrease of  from  at december  the reduction in working capital is principally due to the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax asset  capital expenditures and the reclassification of  of manufactured equipment from inventory to property  plant and equipment when we entered into a month agreement to lease equipment to a customer 
under the equipment lease agreement  as amended  the customer is leasing the equipment for months and has an option to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term april  
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale together with future cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund operations at the current levels 
critical accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that  among other things  affect the reported amounts of assets  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are most significant where they involve levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or matters susceptible to change  and where they can have a material impact on our financial condition and operating performance 
we discuss below the more significant estimates and related assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
our senior management has discussed the application of these estimates with our audit committee 
revenue recognition revenue from contracts that include multiple element arrangements  such as a sale of standard equipment and basic installation services  is recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element 
revenue on standard equipment is recognized upon delivery in accordance with contractual terms  net of discounts 
the fair value of installation services is deferred until the installation is completed 
management reviews objective evidence such as prices charged when each element is sold separately and selling prices on similar elements sold by competitors in making judgment as to the fair value for each element of the contract 
revenue from long term system arrangements  such as a sale of complex equipment integrated with controls and software is recognized using the percentage of completion method measured based on units delivered 
on such contracts relating to long term system arrangements  management makes judgments regarding costs and profitability estimates measuring progress toward completion 
these judgments are subject to some degree of uncertainty  and unanticipated efforts necessary to complete a complex system could adversely affect operating results in future periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
nevertheless  there is a risk that credit losses in the future will exceed our expectations  in which case our operating results would be adversely affected 
warranty reserves we record a warranty reserve based on our actual historical return rates and repair costs at the time of sale 
while our warranty costs have generally been within our expectations and the provisions established  future returns or repair costs could be in excess of our warranty reserves 
additionally  we do not have extensive warranty claims experience with recently introduced products or products obtained in the newstec acquisition 
a significant increase in product return rates or a significant increase in the costs to repair our products would adversely affect our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns or additional costs occur 
valuation allowance for deferred income taxes sfas accounting for income taxes requires us to use our best judgment to determine the realizability of our deferred tax asset 
as part of this process  we are required to estimate future book taxable income and possible tax planning strategies 
these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results and feasibility of tax planning strategies 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statement  we determined that we require a deferred income tax valuation allowance amounting to  goodwill goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level 
in addition  goodwill should be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its related carrying value 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas requires us to make  subjective and complex judgments on a number of matters  including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting unit 
we tested goodwill in the fourth quarter of  and determined that the fair value of quipp was less than the carrying value 
therefore  we calculated the implied fair value of the company s goodwill  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 which resulted in an impairment charge of  to selling  general and administrative expenses  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of assets held for use sfas no 
requires us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an event of impairment has occurred 
a long lived asset is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  a long lived asset is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we determined our amortizable intangible assets were not impaired in however  if acquired products fail to achieve estimated volume and price levels  market conditions unfavorably change  or other significant estimates are not realized  we may be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 
market risk we are exposed to various types of market risk  including changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
because our cash and investments exceed short and long term debt  the exposure to interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
due to the short term maturities of our investments  we believe there is no significant risk arising from interest rate fluctuations 
to ensure safety and liquidity  we only invest in instruments with credit quality and which are traded in a secondary market 
the counterparties are major financial institutions and government agencies 
inflation the rate of inflation has not had a material impact on operations
