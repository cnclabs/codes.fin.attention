item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following section addresses aspects of noven s financial condition and results of operations 
the contents of this section include an executive summary of our results of operations  an overview of noven and our novogyne joint venture  a review of certain items that may affect the historical or future comparability of our results of operations  an analysis of our results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources  an outlook that includes our current financial guidance for  a discussion of how we apply our critical accounting estimates  and a discussion of recently issued accounting standards 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with noven and novogyne s financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this form k 
executive summary the following executive summary is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations appearing in this item as well as in our financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
for noven  the highlights of the year ended december  included the approval and launch of daytrana  the first transdermal therapy for adhd and our first product commercialized outside the ht category  as well as record financial results reported by our novogyne joint venture 
daytrana was approved by the fda in april  triggering a million approval milestone payment from shire 
our results for included the recognition of million in license revenues associated with daytrana milestones  as well as million in daytrana product sales to shire 
primarily due to daytrana product and license revenues  our net revenues increased to million  a increase over in  our net revenues benefited from the recognition of million in deferred license revenues in connection with our collaboration with endo  of which million the fentanyl revenues was associated with the fda s decision to cease review of our application for a generic fentanyl patch 
those same circumstances caused us to record in an aggregate million in charges associated with the write off and destruction of our fentanyl inventories the fentanyl charges 
our gross margin percentage for was  substantially lower than what our gross margin in would have been but for the fentanyl charges 
our gross margin was adversely affected by  among other things  startup costs and related inefficiencies associated with the scale up and expedited production of daytrana launch quantities in the second quarter  as well as increased overhead costs associated with facility expansion for new products and quality related improvements 
due in part to our continuing efforts to improve efficiencies and reduce costs  including a third quarter cost reduction program  we reported improvements in gross margin percentage in the second half of the year 
specifically  our overall gross margin percentage increased from in the second quarter to in each of the third and fourth quarters of 
table of contents research and development expenses for decreased million  or  to million  primarily due to reduced development expenses related to our developmental fentanyl patch and daytrana 
marketing  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million  primarily as a result of the recognition of million in stock based compensation expenses due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r in  a million increase in personnel costs and a million termination charge related to the third quarter cost reduction program 
we recognized million in earnings from novogyne in  an increase of compared to interest income for increased million  or  over  largely reflecting a higher average cash balance in resulting from the receipt of a million approval milestone payment from shire 
for  we reported net income of million diluted earnings per share  compared to net income of million diluted earnings per share reported in net income in reflected the impact of both the fentanyl revenues and the fentanyl charges 
our novogyne joint venture reported net revenues of million  a increase over  reflecting increased sales of vivelle dot the market leading product in the transdermal estrogen therapy category partially offset by increased sales and returns allowances 
novogyne s selling  general and administrative expenses for increased to million  primarily reflecting increased marketing  sample and promotional spending in support of vivelle dot 
novogyne s net income increased to million compared to at december   noven had an aggregate million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million at december  in february  shire notified us that its net sales of daytrana in were sufficient to trigger payment of the first of three potential million milestones to noven 
we received that payment in the first quarter of for accounting purposes  we expect to defer the revenue associated with the daytrana sales milestones and recognize them as license revenues on a straight line basis through the first quarter of prescription demand for our two lead products increased during total prescriptions for vivelle dot increased in compared to  and total prescriptions for novogyne s products  taken as a whole  increased for the same period 
total prescriptions for daytrana increased in the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter of  which was the first complete quarter following the product s launch 
the increase in daytrana prescriptions reflects initial uptake of a newly launched product and is not indicative of the product s ongoing growth rate 
overview of noven and our novogyne joint venture we develop and manufacture advanced transdermal patches  offering commercial products in both the adhd and ht categories 
we presently derive a significant portion of our revenues  and an even greater percentage of our profits  from sales of ht patches 
in the united states  our ht products are marketed and sold by novogyne pharmaceuticals  our joint venture with novartis 
our business  financial position and results of operations currently depend largely on novogyne and its marketing of our three principal ht products vivelle dot  vivelle and combipatch in the 
table of contents united states 
a discussion of novogyne s results and their impact on our results can be found under the caption results of operations equity in earnings of novogyne 
in all countries other than the united states  canada and japan  we have licensed the marketing rights to our ht products to novartis pharma  which is an affiliate of novartis 
in most of these markets  vivelle is marketed under the brand name menorest  vivelle dot is marketed under the brand name estradot and combipatch is marketed under the brand name estalis 
we hold a equity interest in novogyne  and novartis holds the remaining equity interest 
novartis is entitled to an annual million preferred return over our interest in novogyne  which has the effect of reducing our share of novogyne s income in the first quarter of each year 
after the annual preferred return to novartis  our share of novogyne s income increases as product sales increase  subject to a maximum of 
our share of novogyne s income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the income we recognize from novogyne is a non cash item 
any cash we receive from novogyne with respect to our equity in its earnings is in the form of cash distributions declared by novogyne s management committee 
accordingly  the amount of cash distributions that we receive from novogyne in any period may not be the same as the amount of income we recognize from novogyne for that period 
in  and  we received million  million and million  respectively  in cash distributions from novogyne  which accounted for a substantial portion of our net cash flows provided by operating activities for these periods 
the market for ht products  including transdermals  significantly declined in the years following the july publication of the whi study that found adverse health risks associated with ht  and in current periods the market continues to decline 
comparing the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of  total prescriptions dispensed in the ht market in the united states decreased 
comparing the same periods  aggregate prescriptions for our united states ht products increased 
total prescriptions in the estrogen segment of the ht market in the united states decreased comparing the same periods  while prescriptions for our vivelle line of products increased 
vivelle dot  which represented of our total united states ht prescriptions in the fourth quarter of  increased from the fourth quarter of we believe that vivelle dot patch prescriptions have benefited from patient conversions from the original vivelle product the predecessor product to vivelle dot  which represented of our total united states prescriptions in the fourth quarter of vivelle is in the process of being discontinued in several jurisdictions where our advanced vivelle dot et patch has gained acceptance 
we ceased manufacturing of vivelle for the united states market at the end of united states prescriptions for our combipatch product which represented approximately of our total united states ht prescriptions in the fourth quarter of decreased from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of  while prescriptions for the total united states market for fixed combination hormone therapy decreased 
the combination therapy arm of the whi studies involved an oral combination estrogen progestin product and  accordingly  the combination therapy segment of the ht market has experienced the most significant decline 
further decreases above expectations for our combipatch product whether as a result of the whi studies  competition in the category or otherwise could require novogyne which holds the combipatch marketing rights to record an impairment loss related to these marketing rights  which would adversely affect the results of operations of both noven and novogyne

table of contents certain items that may affect historical or future comparability daytrana the dea controls access to controlled substances  including methylphenidate  the active ingredient in daytrana 
manufacturers of products containing controlled substances must annually apply to the dea for procurement quota in order to obtain these substances for manufacturing 
in  we received an initial grant of methylphenidate quota from the dea 
we submitted supplemental applications for additional quota to fulfill product orders received from shire 
the dea granted additional quota in november  but less than we had requested  and later than required to fulfill product orders 
as a result  we ended the year with million in full year daytrana sales to shire and approximately million in daytrana product backorders that we fulfilled in the first quarter of the reduction in daytrana revenues negatively affected our gross margin in the fourth quarter of our ability to produce daytrana and improve the gross margins from the sale of this product is contingent on  among other things  receiving a sufficient supply of the active methylphenidate ingredient from shire as well as sufficient quota from the dea for this controlled substance 
at any given time  we expect to have applications pending with the dea for annual or additional procurement quota that may be critical to continued production 
any delay or stoppage in the supply of the active methylphenidate ingredient could cause us to lose revenues or incur additional costs including those related to expedited production  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have received reports concerning difficulty removing the release liner from a small percentage of daytrana patches 
although the product meets specifications  during the first quarter of  we implemented enhancements intended to make daytrana easier to use 
if daytrana sales are materially impacted because of this issue  then noven s results of operations and financial condition would likely be adversely affected 
stock based compensation expense currently  our outstanding stock based compensation consists of i stock options  ii stock settled appreciation rights ssars  and iii for our non employee directors  restricted stock awards 
prior to january   all awards granted to employees under the long term incentive plan the plan were stock options 
in  we began granting ssars to employees and restricted stock to non employee directors in lieu of stock options  and from time to time we may consider or grant other forms of stock based compensation 
prior to  stock based compensation expense was not required to be recognized in our statements of operations 
on january   we adopted the provisions of  and accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with  sfas r  which requires us to expense the fair value of stock based compensation awards in our statement of operations 
we elected the modified prospective method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
total pre tax stock based compensation expense recognized in our statements of operations for was million  of which million was recognized in marketing  general and administrative and million was recognized in each of research and development and cost of products sold  respectively 
there were no stock based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory or fixed assets for 
table of contents at december   the unamortized compensation expense that we expect to record in future periods related to currently outstanding unvested stock options  ssars and restricted stock  as determined in accordance with sfas r  is approximately million before the effect of income taxes  of which million  million  million and million is expected to be incurred in   and  respectively 
we will also incur additional expense in future years related to new equity awards that may be granted in the future that cannot yet be quantified 
in order to eliminate some of the future compensation expense that we would otherwise have recognized in our statements of operations under sfas r  during  we accelerated the vesting of certain stock options under the plan 
as a result of this action  options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock became immediately exercisable  including options held by our executive officers to purchase approximately  shares 
as a result of the acceleration  during  we eliminated approximately million of compensation expense  net of applicable income taxes  from our future statements of operations  however  this expense is included in the pro forma footnote disclosure for the year ended december  results of operations revenues total revenues are summarized as follows dollar amounts in thousands change change product revenues novogyne product sales royalties product revenues third parties product sales royalties total product revenues contract and license revenues contract license net revenues net revenues as described in more detail below  the increase in net revenues as compared to was primarily attributable to the launch of daytrana  which contributed million to our product revenues and million to our license revenues in the increase in net revenues as compared to was attributable to an increase in license revenues related to the recognition of million of license revenue from our fentanyl agreement with endo which is described in more detail below 
in addition  there was an aggregate 
table of contents increase in sales for our us and international products and an increase in royalties as a result of novogyne s higher sales of vivelle dot 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in contract revenues 
product revenues novogyne product revenues novogyne consists of our sales of vivelle dot  vivelle  estradot for canada and combipatch to novogyne at a fixed price for product sampling and resale by novogyne primarily in the united states  as well as the royalties we receive as a result of novogyne s sales of vivelle dot and vivelle 
for additional information on the components of product revenues novogyne as well as our other sources of revenues  see critical accounting estimates revenue recognition 
revenues from novogyne in were relatively consistent with the million increase in revenues from novogyne for as compared to was primarily related to a million increase in unit sales of vivelle dot and a million increase in royalties 
this increase was offset by a million decline in unit sales of estradot for canada 
the increase in vivelle dot product sales and royalties was attributable to higher sales at novogyne due to increased prescription trends and price increases at novogyne 
the decline in unit sales of estradot was primarily attributable to fulfilling orders in related to a planned transition from vivelle to estradot in canada 
price was not a contributing factor to the overall increase 
product revenues third parties product revenues third parties consists of sales of estradot  estalis and menorest to novartis pharma at a price based on a percentage of novartis pharma s net selling price subject to certain minima for resale primarily outside the united states and japan  together with royalties generated from novartis pharma s sales of vivelle and estradot in canada 
product revenues third parties also includes sales of femiest to aventis for resale in japan 
beginning in the second quarter of  product revenues third parties also includes sales of daytrana to shire for resale in the united states 
the million increase in product revenues from third parties for as compared to was primarily related to million in unit sales of daytrana  reflecting initial product launch 
this increase was partially offset by a million decline in the recognition of the price reconciliation payments received from novartis pharma 
noven records such payments from time to time upon novartis pharma s determination that its actual sales price of our product entitles us to receive amounts in excess of the minimum transfer price at which we initially sold the product to novartis pharma 
volume increases of million and million for estradot and femiest  respectively  were offset by volume declines of million and million for estalis and menorest  respectively 
we believe the volume increases and declines were all related to the timing of orders  except for the decline in menorest  which was attributable to the continued transition from menorest to estradot 
the million increase in product revenues from third parties for as compared to primarily related to million increase in unit sales and a million increase related to pricing 
the increase in unit sales was mostly attributable to million in higher sales of estalis 
we believe this increase was attributable to the timing of orders due to the re stocking of inventory in launched countries and not to an increase in underlying demand 
the million increase in 
table of contents revenue related to pricing was primarily due to the recognition of a higher price adjustment payment received from novartis pharma in compared to contract and license revenues contract revenues consists of the recognition of payments received as work is performed on research and development projects 
the payments received may take the form of non refundable up front payments  payments received upon the completion of certain phases of development work and success milestone payments 
license revenues consist of the recognition of non refundable up front  milestone and similar payments under license agreements 
contract revenues declined million for as compared to due to a decline in contract work performed 
license revenue increased million for as compared to primarily due to the recognition of million in daytrana license revenues and the recognition of a million one time non refundable payment from a third party for a license to certain of our patents  partially offset by million in license revenue recognized in related to our fentanyl agreement with endo that did not recur in included in the million of license revenue in was million that was recognized in the fourth quarter of due to the termination of our fentanyl agreement with endo upon the fda s decision to cease review of our fentanyl patch application 
the million decline in contract revenues for as compared to was primarily related to our recognition in of million in product development milestones under our collaboration with p g pharmaceuticals that did not recur in this decline was partially offset by million in contract revenues related to work performed in on development contracts 
the million increase in license revenue is primarily attributable to the recognition of the remaining deferred revenue balance related to our fentanyl agreement with endo as discussed above 
gross margin this section discusses our gross margin percentages relating to our product revenues i across all of our products overall gross margin  ii on our product revenues from novogyne gross margin novogyne  which for accounting purposes is considered a related party  and iii on our product revenues from third parties gross margin third parties 
product revenues from third parties primarily include ht product sales to novartis pharma for resale primarily outside the us and japan  as well as daytrana product sales to shire 
this section includes a non gaap analysis of gross margins that excludes an aggregate million charge to cost of products sold in relating to the write off and destruction of fentanyl pre launch inventories the fentanyl charge 
we took this charge following the fda s decision in september to cease review of our fentanyl patch anda 
we believe such a non gaap analysis is useful to investors in order to meaningfully evaluate our ongoing  underlying business and compare our financial results to other years 
for the same reasons  management uses this non gaap analysis to evaluate noven s ongoing  underlying business 
this analysis should not be considered an alternative to measures computed in accordance with gaap  nor should it be considered an indicator of our overall financial performance 
the allocation of overhead costs impacts our determination of gross margins for each of our products 
overhead costs  which were in excess of million in  consist of salaries and 
table of contents benefits  supplies and tools  equipment costs  depreciation  and insurance costs and represent a substantial portion of our inventory production costs 
the allocation of overhead among our various products requires us to make significant estimates that involve subjective and often complex judgments 
using different estimates would likely result in materially different results for gross margin novogyne and gross margin third parties than are presented in the gross margin table below 
our gross margins are summarized as follows dollar amounts in thousands overall gross margin product revenues cost of products sold gross profit product revenues less cost of products sold gross margin gross profit as a percentage of product revenues fentanyl charge gross profit excluding fentanyl charge gross margin excluding fentanyl charge gross margin novogyne product revenues cost of products sold gross profit product revenues less cost of products sold gross margin gross profit as a percentage of product revenues 
table of contents gross margin third parties product revenues cost of products sold gross profit loss product revenues less cost of products sold gross margin gross profit loss as a percentage of product revenues fentanyl charge gross loss profit excluding fentanyl charge gross loss margin excluding fentanyl charge in general  our sales of ht products to novogyne for resale in the us have a higher gross margin than our other products  reflecting favorable pricing  larger production orders and other factors 
our sales of ht products to novartis pharma for resale in international markets generally have a lower gross margin than sales of ht products sold to novogyne due to  among other things  unfavorable pricing environments in foreign markets  and smaller production orders 
our gross margin on product sales of daytrana to shire has been negatively affected by  among other things  costs and inefficiencies associated with the commencement of commercial production of the product 
as discussed below  we are working to improve the profitability of daytrana product sales  but we cannot assure that we will be successful 
during the years presented in the gross margin tables  we have expanded our facilities and increased staffing for the production of fentanyl  daytrana  and other developmental products the expansion activities 
we also have increased personnel and other resources dedicated to quality control in our ht product line ht quality improvements 
together  these initiatives expanded and improved our production infrastructure  but they also increased overhead and negatively affected our gross margins 
our ability to improve gross margins from current levels is dependent in part on our ability to launch new commercial products that leverage this infrastructure and assist in the absorption of overhead  as well as on our ability to control and or reduce costs 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in improving our gross margins in future periods 
we implemented a cost reduction program in the third quarter of to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in our operations the cost reduction program 
we believe this program will result in annual pre tax savings of up to million  the majority of which will be recognized in manufacturing costs 
this program contributed to an improved overall gross margin in the second half of we sell daytrana finished product to shire at a fixed cost  so our profit on product sales of daytrana depends on our ability to manufacture the product efficiently 
start up expenses and 
table of contents production inefficiencies associated with the commencement of daytrana production  including lower than desired yields and increased costs associated with meeting launch timelines together  the daytrana launch costs  negatively affected overall gross margin and gross margin third parties in in addition  the cost of the active methylphenidate ingredient ami used in the production of daytrana is not included in our daytrana product revenues or in our cost of products sold 
shire supplies us with ami for production of daytrana  and retains title to the ami 
under this arrangement  we bear certain risks of manufacturing loss related to ami and are obligated to reimburse shire for the cost of ami if our production yields do not meet certain minimum levels 
for  our cost of products sold included million in ami reimbursements to shire which negatively affected overall gross margin and gross margin third parties in for  daytrana product revenues were million  and cost of products sold related to daytrana was million  primarily reflecting the impact of the daytrana launch costs and the ami reimbursements 
our overall gross margin was   and in the first  second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
the decline in the second quarter primarily reflects the daytrana launch costs and ami reimbursements 
the improvement in the third and fourth quarters primarily reflects improved efficiencies and yields in daytrana production  as well as cost savings associated with the third quarter cost reduction program 
we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to improve overall gross margin 
our expectations for gross margins in future periods are addressed under outlook below 
the decline in overall gross margin in compared to excluding the impact of the fentanyl charge was primarily related to costs associated with the expansion activities 
the decline in gross margin novogyne in compared to reflected costs associated with the ht quality improvements 
in addition  gross margin novogyne in benefited from a million reduction in allowances for returns that had been established in  based upon our review and analysis of historical and expected future returns 
the decline in gross margin third parties in compared to excluding the impact of the fentanyl charge was primarily related to higher costs associated with the expansion activities  partially offset by a million increase in price adjustment payments in operating expenses operating expenses are summarized as follows dollar amounts in thousands change change research and development marketing  general and administrative research and development research and development expense includes costs associated with  among other things  product formulation  pre clinical testing  clinical studies  regulatory and medical affairs  production of product for clinical and regulatory purposes  production related development engineering for developmental products  and the personnel associated with each of these functions 

table of contents the million decrease in as compared to was primarily attributable to a million decline in development engineering expenses related to our methylphenidate and fentanyl patches  partially offset by a million increase in stock based compensation  a million increase in personnel costs and a million increase in other costs associated with the development of other products 
the million increase in as compared to was primarily attributable to a million increase in development engineering related to our methylphenidate and fentanyl patches  a million increase in clinical studies and a million increase in personnel costs 
marketing  general and administrative the million increase in marketing  general and administrative expenses in as compared to was primarily attributable to million in stock based compensation expenses resulting from the adoption of sfas r in  a million increase in compensation expense primarily due to the addition of personnel in business development  strategic alliances and other key areas and a million charge associated with the elimination of employee positions as part of the cost reduction program discussed in our gross margin section above 
consulting costs increased million due to the timing of work performed on projects related to our compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and to a lesser extent increased information management compliance costs 
the million decline in as compared to was primarily attributable to a million reduction in professional fees related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and other regulatory requirements and million related to the reduction of our allowance for costs related to product recalls established in these reductions were partially offset by a million increase in costs associated with expansion activities for anticipated new product launches 
other income and expenses interest income interest income increased million  or  in as compared to due to an increase in the average cash balance  which was primarily attributable to the million milestone payment received from shire in april in connection with the approval of our daytrana product as well as million received from the exercise of stock options 
in addition to higher average cash balances  we invested a higher portion of our cash in short term investments which primarily consist of investment grade  asset backed  variable debt obligations and municipal auction rate securities that yielded higher interest income 
we also benefited from an increase in interest rates in as compared to interest income increased million  or  in as compared to and was primarily attributable to the investing of a portion of our cash into short term investments  as described above  that yielded higher interest income as well as an increase in interest rates 
income taxes our effective tax rate was for  and for and  respectively 
the decrease in our effective tax rate for as compared to the prior year relates primarily to higher 
table of contents non taxable interest income as a percentage of taxable income 
this decreased tax rate was partially offset by higher taxable income in as compared to primarily due to the fentanyl charge in the prior year  non deductible stock based compensation expense related to incentive stock options that began in and certain credits and reductions for reserves for internal revenue service audits that occurred in the prior period that did not recur in the current period 
the provision for income taxes is based on the federal statutory and state income tax rates 
net deferred income tax assets are measured using the average graduated tax rate for the estimated amount of annual taxable income in the years that the asset is expected to be recovered 
the effect of adjusting the expected tax rate related to the net deferred income tax assets is included in the provision for income taxes 
as of december   we had a net deferred tax asset of million 
realization of this deferred tax asset depends upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will be realized based upon estimated future taxable income 
equity in earnings of novogyne we share in the earnings of novogyne  after satisfaction of an annual preferred return of million to novartis  according to an established formula 
novogyne produced sufficient income in each of  and for us to recognize earnings from novogyne under the formula 
we report our share of novogyne s earnings as equity in earnings of novogyne on our statements of operations 
the financial results of novogyne are summarized as follows dollar amounts in thousands change change gross revenues sales allowances sales returns allowances  n m n m  sales and returns allowances net revenues cost of sales gross profit gross margin percentage selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest income net income noven s equity in earnings of novogyne n m not meaningful 
table of contents novogyne s gross revenues  which are calculated by adding sales allowances and sales returns allowances to net revenues  are discussed in this section because noven s management believes it is a useful measure to evaluate and compare novogyne s total sales from period to period in light of the significant historic fluctuations in novogyne s sales allowances and returns 
novogyne revenues novogyne sells its products to trade customers  including wholesalers  distributors and chain pharmacies 
as has historically been the case  the timing of purchases by trade customers is driven by the inventory needs of each customer and other factors  and does not necessarily track underlying prescription trends in any given period or coincide with novogyne s quarterly financial reporting periods 
as a result  the timing of orders by trade customers is difficult to predict and can lead to significant variability in novogyne s results  especially when comparing quarterly periods 
novogyne s gross revenues increased million for as compared to by product  the increase in novogyne s gross revenues reflects a million increase in sales of vivelle dot estradot  partially offset by a million and a million decline in sales of vivelle and combipatch  respectively 
the higher vivelle dot estradot sales were primarily attributable to a million increase in unit sales due to an increase in prescriptions as well as the timing of orders  and an million increase related to pricing 
the decline in vivelle  our first generation estrogen patch  is due to a million decline in unit sales due to product maturity and the planned discontinuation of the product  partially offset by a million increase related to pricing 
the decline in combipatch was due to a million decline in unit sales as a result of the continuing decline in the market for combination therapies as well as the impact of a competitive product 
this combipatch decline was partially offset by a million increase related to pricing 
novogyne s gross revenues increased million for as compared to  primarily due to a million increase in sales of vivelle dot  partially offset by a million decline in sales of vivelle  a million decline in unit sales of estradot to an affiliate of novartis pharma in canada novartis canada  and a million decline in sales of combipatch 
approximately million of the vivelle dot increase was due to increased unit sales based on increased trade demand  while the remaining million increase related to pricing 
the decline in vivelle  our first generation estrogen patch  was mostly attributable to a decline in unit sales due to product maturity 
the decline in sales of estradot to novartis canada is primarily attributable to the timing of orders  as sales benefited from novartis canada stocking inventory as they transitioned from vivelle to estradot 
the lower sales of combipatch were due to a continuing decline in the market for combination therapies as well as the impact of a competitive product

in addition  benefited from a reduction in allowances of expiring product due to lower than expected returns as a result of a decline in actual returns of vivelle at the time 

table of contents the decrease in sales returns allowances as a percentage of gross revenues for as compared to was primarily related to lower than expected returns as a result of a decline in actual returns of vivelle and vivelle dot in as a result of this analysis  allowances related to prior years were reduced by million 
novogyne gross margin novogyne s gross margin was consistent for as compared to the gross margin increase in as compared to was primarily related to lower sales returns allowances attributable to lower than expected returns as described above as well as higher sales of vivelle dot  which has a higher gross margin than other products sold by novogyne  and lower sales of estradot  which has a lower gross margin than other products sold by novogyne 
novogyne selling  general and administrative novogyne s selling  general and administrative expenses increased million for as compared to  primarily due to a million increase in marketing  advertising and promotion expenses and a million increase in sample expenses primarily attributable to the timing of sample orders by novogyne 
novogyne s selling  general and administrative expenses declined million for as compared to  primarily due to a million decline in sample expenses primarily attributable to the timing of sample orders by novogyne  and a million decline in advertising and promotion expenses 
these declines were partially offset by a million increase in sales force expenses 
in addition  benefited from a million reduction in expenses associated with the co promotion of one of novartis products

short term and long term liquidity our principal sources of short term liquidity are existing cash  cash generated from product sales  fees and royalties under development and license agreements and distributions from novogyne 
for the year ended december   a substantial portion of our income before income taxes was comprised of equity in earnings of novogyne  a non cash item 
accordingly  our net income may not be reflective of our operating cash flow or our short term liquidity 
although we expect to continue to receive distributions from novogyne  there can be no assurance that novogyne will have sufficient profits or cash flow to pay distributions or that novogyne s management committee will authorize such distributions 
our short term cash flow is dependent on sales  royalties  license fees and distributions associated with transdermal products 
any decrease in sales of those products by us or our licensees or any increase in returns of products to novogyne including any such changes resulting from the ht studies  the further decline of the ht market  or the inability or failure of novogyne to pay distributions would have a material adverse effect on our short term liquidity and require us to rely on our existing cash balances and short term investments or on borrowings to support our operations and business 
in april  noven received a million milestone payment from shire as a result of the final marketing approval of daytrana by the fda 
shire s net sales of daytrana exceeded the threshold for the first sales milestone in the fourth quarter of and  accordingly  we received a million payment from shire in the first quarter of noven may also earn up to two additional million milestone payments upon shire s achievement of million and million in annual net sales of daytrana  respectively 
shire commercially launched the product in june the majority of the income taxes related to the million milestone are expected to be paid in or early and the majority of the income taxes related to the first million milestone are expected to be paid in or early our liquidity in benefited from million received as the exercise price paid by option holders in connection with their exercise of employee stock options 
this number can be expected to fluctuate from year to year depending on the performance of noven s stock and equity award exercises 
capital expenditures were million in and we expect our capital expenditures for full year to be approximately in line with levels 
we expect to fund anticipated capital expenditures from our existing cash balances 
as a general matter  we believe that we have 
table of contents sufficient liquidity available to meet our operating needs and anticipated short term capital requirements 
if our products under development are successful  we expect that our cash requirements will increase to fund plant and equipment purchases to expand production capacity 
for our long term operating needs  we intend to utilize funds derived from the above sources  as well as funds generated through sales of products under development or products that we may license or acquire from others 
we expect that such funds will be comprised of payments received pursuant to future development and licensing arrangements  as well as direct sales of our own products 
we cannot assure that we will successfully complete the development of such products  that we will obtain regulatory approval for any such products  that any approved product may be produced in commercial quantities  at reasonable costs  and be successfully marketed  or that we will successfully negotiate future licensing or product acquisition arrangements 
because much of the cost associated with product development and expansion of manufacturing facilities is incurred prior to product launch  if we are unsuccessful in out licensing  or if we are unable to launch additional commercially viable products that we develop or that we license or acquire from others  we will have incurred the up front costs associated with product development or acquisition without the benefit of the liquidity generated by sales of those products  which could adversely affect our long term liquidity needs 
factors that could impact our ability to develop or acquire and launch additional commercially viable products are discussed under risk factors 
from time to time we may explore the acquisition of one or more technologies  products or businesses that we believe may be complementary to our existing business 
we expect to draw upon our cash and short term investments to fund all or a portion of such potential strategic acquisitions 
we may also consider issuing equity securities to fund potential acquisitions 
to the extent our existing cash and short term investments are insufficient to fund any large scale acquisitions we may be required to seek debt financing or to issue equity or debt securities 
if a material acquisition is completed  our results of operations and financial condition could change materially in future periods 
if we finance all or any portion of an acquisition through debt financing or debt securities we would be required to devote funds to service and ultimately repay such debt and could be subject to financial or operational covenants that could limit or hinder our ability to conduct our business 
in addition  although we have not repurchased any of our common stock since  it is possible that a portion of our cash and short term investments could be used to repurchase noven common stock under our previously announced stock repurchase program 
stock repurchases  if any  may be made in the open market  including pursuant to a trading program under rule b promulgated under the securities exchange act of to the extent that capital requirements exceed available capital  we will seek alternative sources of financing to fund our operations 
no assurance can be given that alternative financing will be available  if at all  in a timely manner  or on favorable terms 
if we are unable to obtain satisfactory alternative financing  we may be required to delay or reduce our proposed expenditures  including expenditures for research and development and plant and equipment  in order to meet our future cash requirements

outlook a summary of our current financial guidance is provided below 
this forward looking information is based on our current assumptions and expectations  many of which are beyond our control to achieve 
in particular  for purposes of this guidance we have assumed  among other things  that during there will not be any material acquisitions of products  companies  or technologies or other transactions  changes in noven s or novogyne s accounting or accounting principles or any of the estimates or judgments underlying our critical accounting policies  regulatory or technological developments  changes in the supply of  demand for  or distribution of our products including any changes resulting from competitive products  product recalls  or new study results  negative actions with respect to our applications for methylphenidate quota or other disruptions in supplies of raw materials  changes in our business relationships collaborations  or changes in the economy or the health care sector generally 
financial guidance is inherently uncertain 
accordingly  we cannot assure that we will achieve results consistent with this guidance  and our actual financial results could differ materially from the expected results discussed below 
for a discussion of certain factors that may impact our actual financial results for the periods referenced  readers should carefully consider the risks  
table of contents uncertainties and cautionary factors discussed above under risk factors beginning on page of this report 
daytrana 
as discussed above  during we received a million milestone payment from shire relating to the final marketing approval of daytrana by the fda 
in the fourth quarter of  the first of three potential million daytrana sales milestones was triggered  resulting in the payment of million from shire to us in the first quarter of we expect the second million milestone payment to trigger in  and it is possible that the third milestone will trigger in the same year  in each case depending on the level of shire s commercial sales of the product 
we expect to defer and recognize the approval milestone and all sales milestones as license revenues on a straight line basis  beginning on the date the milestone is achieved through the first quarter of  which is our current best estimate of the end of the useful economic life of the product for accounting purposes 
we expect our daytrana product sales to shire for full year to be between million and million  subject to  among other things  demand for the product and the availability and timing of dea quota 
ht product revenues 
given customer orders  prescription trends and other factors  we expect noven s ht product revenues for full year to approximate levels  with growth in our us ht product revenues expected to offset a decline in our international ht revenues 
contract and license revenues 
we expect contract revenues in to approximate levels 
we expect license revenues to increase substantially in compared to  reflecting higher daytrana license revenues 
gross margin 
since the launch of daytrana in the second quarter of  we have worked to reduce costs and improve yields  and we reported significant improvement in our overall gross margin for the third and fourth quarters of compared to our overall gross margin in the second quarter of for full year  we are targeting an overall gross margin in the mid range  subject to a variety of factors  some of which are not within our control 
these factors include the availability and timing of methylphenidate quota and our ability to effectively coordinate production between daytrana and our ht products to improve facility utilization  and our ability to improve yields  and these same factors could cause our overall gross margin in any particular quarter to vary significantly from other quarters in research and development expense 
we expect our research and development expense in to approach million  depending on our ability to advance certain development projects into human clinical studies during marketing  general and administrative expense 
we expect our marketing  general and administrative expense in to increase in the range over levels 
stock based compensation expenses 
based on the expense associated with stock based compensation previously awarded  and our estimate of the expense associated with such compensation that may be awarded in the course of  we estimate that our total stock based compensation expenses for full year will be approximately million  compared to million for full year all other financial guidance provided in this outlook includes the effect of our anticipated stock based compensation expenses 

table of contents novogyne 
based on current prescription trends and other factors  we expect novogyne s full year net revenues to increase in the range compared to levels  and we expect novogyne s net income and profit contribution to noven for to increase by close to compared to levels 
tax matters 
we estimate that our effective tax rate for full year will be in the to range  which is consistent with levels 
in or early  we expect to pay taxes in the million range associated with the million cash milestone payment received from shire in capital expenditures 
we expect our capital expenditures for full year to be approximately in line with levels 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and estimates related to allowance for returns related to product recalls  the fair value of stock based compensation granted to employees and outside directors  the determination of the net realizable value of the net deferred tax asset and our effective tax rate 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
many of our critical accounting estimates are those which we believe require the most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain or which involve factors that may be beyond our control 
using different assumptions could result in materially different results 
a discussion of our critical accounting estimates  the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions  is as follows revenue recognition we enter into certain contracts that have various terms and conditions that may have multiple revenue characteristics  including license revenues  contract revenues  product sales  royalties and manufacturing revenues 
as prescribed by emerging issues task force accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  we analyze each contract in order to separate each deliverable into separate units of accounting and then recognize revenues for those separated units at their fair value as earned in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin topic  revenue recognition topic or other applicable revenue recognition guidance 
the analysis prescribed by eitf requires us to make a number of significant assumptions and judgments  including those related to sales price  unit costs and manufacturing profit  expected launch date of the product licensed and valuation of that licensed product  and price  cost  and applicable profit of research and development work to be performed 
changes in any of these assumptions and judgments could lead to a different conclusion on what the separate units of 
table of contents accounting are and their applicable fair values  which may lead to material changes to revenue recognition 
license revenues consist of up front  milestone and similar payments under license agreements and are not recognized until earned under the terms of the applicable agreements 
in most cases  license revenues are deferred and recognized over the estimated product life cycle  which is management s best estimate of the earning period 
estimates of product life cycles are inherently uncertain as a result of regulatory  competitive or medical developments 
we estimate product life cycles based on our assessment of various factors  including the expected launch date of the product licensed  the strength of the intellectual property protection of the product  and various other competitive  developmental and regulatory issues  and contractual terms 
any change to the actual or estimated product life could require us to change the recognition period 
management s best estimate of the end of the product life cycle for daytrana extends through the first quarter of  which results in the annual recognition of approximately million in license revenues for the million approval milestone payment we received from shire in april if our estimate of the daytrana product life cycle should change  we will be required to change the license revenue recognition period on a prospective basis  which may materially change the license revenues that we recognize in any given period 
for example  with respect to the million approval milestone payment  we would have recognized million and million in daytrana license revenues on an annual basis had we determined that the product life cycle ended in the first quarter of and  respectively 
contract revenues consist of contract payments related to research and development projects performed for third parties 
the work performed by us includes feasibility studies to determine if a specific drug is amenable to transdermal drug delivery  the actual formulation of a specific drug into a transdermal drug delivery system  studies to address the ongoing stability of the drug in a transdermal drug delivery system and manufacturing of batches of product that can be used in human clinical trials 
we receive contract payments for the work we perform in the following forms nonrefundable up front payments prior to commencing the work or certain phases of the work  additional payments upon completion of additional phases  and in some cases  success milestone payments based on achievement of specified performance criteria 
for non refundable up front payments received prior to commencing work  we recognize revenue based on the proportionate share proportional performance method of the work performed by us in any given period based on the total hours we expect to incur on the project to deliver all our obligations under the contract as we believe direct hours spent on the projects is the best indicator of our delivery of the obligation and earning process for the contract 
there are a number of assumptions  estimates and judgments that are involved in determining the total hours we expect to incur on the project  including personnel and time involved 
similar assumptions  estimates and judgments are involved in determining the proportionate share of the work performed by us in any given period in addition to estimates of hours remaining to complete the project 
any changes in these assumptions  estimates and judgments may cause us to change the revenue recognition for contracts 
product revenues are net of an allowance for returns 
we establish allowances for returns for product that has been recalled or that we believe is probable of being recalled 
the methodology 
table of contents used by us to estimate product recall returns is based on the distribution and expiration dates of the affected product and overall trade inventory levels 
these estimates are based on currently available information  and the ultimate outcome may be significantly different than the amounts estimated given the subjective nature of the assumptions and complexities inherent in this area and in the pharmaceutical industry 
if our estimate concerning the amount of the product returns is incorrect or if our partners should initiate further unexpected recalls  then our results of operations could be materially different 
for example  in  noven and novogyne established allowances for the return of recalled product  which had the effect of reducing noven s and novogyne s net revenues by million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  based on a review of available relevant information  including actual product returns and future expected returns  noven and novogyne reduced these allowances during the year ended december   which had the effect of increasing net revenues for the year ended december  by million and million for noven and novogyne  respectively 
the effect on noven of these adjustments by noven and novogyne was to increase noven s income before income taxes by million for the year ended december  stock based compensation on january   we adopted sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
pre tax stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r in was million 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and ssars 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee equity award exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate  expected forfeiture rates and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options granted by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option  as described in sab we estimate the volatility of common stock by using a combination of both historical and implied volatility based on an equal weighting of each as management believes that marketplace participants would likely use the expected volatility in determining an exchange price for an option 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense accordingly 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our option grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
stock options or ssars may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as 
table of contents compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there currently is no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
inventories inventories consist primarily of raw materials  work in process and finished goods for our commercial branded products and under certain circumstances may include pre launch branded and generic products 
inventory costs include material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method  or fifo or market and as appropriate  we reflect provisions necessary to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to net realizable value 
we use a standard costing system to estimate our actual fifo cost of inventory at the end of each reporting period 
historically  standard costs have been substantially consistent with actual costs 
in addition  the allocation of overhead costs impacts our estimate of the cost of inventory 
total overhead costs  which were in excess of million in  consist of salaries and benefits  supplies and tools  equipment costs  depreciation and insurance costs and represent a substantial portion of our inventory production costs 
the allocation of overhead to inventory production costs and between and among our various products requires us to make significant estimates that involve subjective and often complex judgments  including  among other things  normal production capacity  the relationship between labor costs and overhead costs  the extent of labor that goes into producing products and the amount of overhead costs absorbed in manufacturing inventory 
any change in these assumptions could materially impact our recorded cost of products sold and stated inventory balances 
our net inventory balances were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we determine the market value of our raw materials  finished product and packaging inventories based upon references to current market prices for such items as of the end of each reporting period and record a write down of inventory standard cost to market  when applicable 
we periodically review our inventory for excess items  and we establish a valuation write down based upon the age of specific items in inventory and the expected recovery from the disposition of the items 
a provision is established for the estimated aged surplus  spoiled or damaged products  and discontinued inventory items and components 
the amount of the provision is determined by analyzing inventory composition  expected usage  historical and projected sales information  and other factors 
changes in sales volume due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that could result in materially different amounts for provisions we establish 
if our provisions prove to be inadequate  our inventories could be overstated or understated in any given period 
pre launch inventories pre launch inventories consist primarily of our branded or generic product candidates prior to the date that we anticipate that such products will receive fda final marketing approval or the satisfactory resolution of patent infringement litigation  or any other circumstances that will make our product candidates commercially viable 
we will capitalize pre launch quantities into inventories when we believe it is probable that i a future economic benefit will be derived from the 
table of contents commercialization of the product and or the risk of pre launch inventories is transferred to our collaborative partner  ii the fda will approve the marketing of the product  iii we will validate our process for manufacturing the product within the specifications that have been or will be approved by the fda for such product and iv particularly in the case of a generic product  we will prevail in any patent infringement litigation 
in evaluating whether it is probable that we will derive future economic benefits from our pre launch inventories and whether the pre launch inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  we consider  among other things  the remaining shelf life of that inventory  the current and expected market conditions  the amount of inventory on hand  the substance of communications with the fda during the regulatory approval process and the views of patent and or litigation counsel 
the manufacture of pre launch inventories involves the risk that the fda may not approve such product s for marketing on a timely basis or at all  that each approval may require additional or different testing and or specifications than what was performed in the manufacture of such pre launch inventory and or that the results of related litigation may not be satisfactory 
if any of these risks were to materialize with respect to a given product or if the launch of such product is significantly postponed  we may record additional provisions  which could be material 
for example  as a result of the fda s decision to cease its review of our fentanyl patch application in september   we wrote off the entire fentanyl patch inventory of million  with a charge of million to our cost of products sold  representing our portion of the costs of the inventory as agreed with endo 
we had capitalized million and million of these inventories as of december  and september   respectively  with the full belief that the fda would approve the product and it would be launched 
pre launch inventories of million as of december  consisted of noven s daytrana product  which received final approval from the fda in april and was commercially launched in june there were no pre launch inventories at december  income taxes accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that we not record a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize our net deferred tax asset  which was million as of december  although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred income tax asset will be realized based upon our estimated future income and  accordingly  no valuation allowance for the net deferred income tax asset was deemed necessary as of december  subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the net deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period and could affect our financial results 
our future effective tax rate is based on estimates of expected income and enacted statutory tax rates  as applied to our operations 
significant judgment is required in making these determinations and the ultimate resolution of our tax return positions 
despite our belief that our tax return positions are correct  our policy is to establish accruals for tax contingencies that may result from examinations by tax authorities 
our tax accruals are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant such adjustment 
it is reasonably possible that our effective tax rate and or cash flows may be materially impacted by the ultimate resolution of our tax positions 
if we are assessed interest and or penalties by governing jurisdictions  we include those amounts in our tax provision 
we estimated our effective tax rate for to be  while our effective tax rate for 
table of contents and was  respectively 
if our effective tax rate was proven to be or higher for  our provision for income taxes would materially vary 
investment in novogyne we entered into a joint venture novogyne with novartis  effective may   to market and sell women s prescription healthcare products in the united states and canada 
we account for our investment in novogyne under the equity method and report our share of novogyne s earnings as equity in earnings of novogyne on our statements of operations 
we defer the recognition of of our profit on products sold to novogyne until the products are sold by novogyne 
novogyne intangible asset as of december   novogyne had a long term intangible asset of million related to the acquisition of the marketing rights to combipatch 
the amortization of this asset is included in cost of sales in novogyne s financial statements 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets sfas  the combipatch marketing rights are assessed for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
the impairment testing involves comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the forecasted undiscounted future net cash flows of the product 
this analysis requires novogyne to make a number of significant assumptions and judgments involving prescription trends  sales price  unit cost and product life cycle among many other factors 
in the event the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows of the product and the carrying value is not considered recoverable  an impairment exists 
an impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value  calculated using a discounted future cash flow method 
an impairment loss would be recognized in net income in the period that the impairment occurs 
events giving rise to impairments are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and cannot be predicted 
further declines in combipatch sales whether as a result of the ht studies  competition in the category or otherwise could require novogyne to record an impairment loss related to these marketing rights 
as a result of the significance of the combipatch marketing rights  any such impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on novogyne s and noven s financial position and or results of operations 
novogyne revenue recognition revenues at novogyne are recognized when all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which occurs at the time of shipment of products 
revenues are reduced at the time of sale to reflect expected returns that are estimated based on historical experience 
additionally  provisions are made at the time of sale for all discounts  rebates and estimated sales allowances based on historical experience updated for changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
such provisions are recorded as a reduction of revenue 

table of contents the following table describes the activity for the revenue deduction accruals by major category for the year ended december  amounts in thousands income statement charge reversal adjustments of december january  payments prior years current year medicaid  medicare and state program rebates credits including prescription drug savings cards managed health care rebates chargebacks  including hospital chargebacks cash discounts  direct customer discounts other discounts sales returns allowances total these deductions represent estimates of the related obligations  requiring the use of judgment when estimating the impact of these sales deductions on gross sales for a reporting period 
these estimates for revenue deductions are derived utilizing a combination of information received from third parties  including market data  inventory reports from its major wholesale customers  historical information and other analysis 
novogyne s management believes that due to novartis extensive experience  it is able to reasonably estimate these sales deductions 
the following briefly describes the nature of each revenue deduction and how the related accruals are estimated by novogyne the united states medicaid program is a state government administered program that uses state and federal funds to provide assistance to certain vulnerable and needy individuals and families 
in  the medicaid drug rebate program was established to reduce state and federal expenditures for prescription drugs 
under the rebate program  rebates are paid to states based on drugs paid for by those states 
provisions for estimating medicaid rebates are calculated using a combination of historical experience  product and population growth  price increases  the impact of contracting strategies and specific terms in the individual state agreements 
these provisions are then adjusted based upon the established re filing process with individual states 
for medicaid  the calculation of rebates involves interpretation of relevant regulations  which are subject to challenge or change in interpretative guidance by government authorities 
since medicaid rebates are typically billed up to six months after the product is dispensed  any rebate adjustments may involve revisions of accruals for several quarters 
the products also participate in prescription drug savings programs that offer savings to patients that are eligible participants under united states medicare programs 
these savings vary 
table of contents based on a patient s current drug coverage and personal income levels 
provisions for the obligations under these programs are based on historical experience  trend analysis and current program terms 
on january   an additional prescription drug benefit was added to the united states medicare program which funds healthcare benefits to individuals over the age of individuals that previously had dual medicaid medicare drug benefit eligibility had their medicaid prescription drug coverage replaced on january   by the new medicare part d coverage provided through private prescription drug plans 
the change led to a significant shift of plan participants between programs in which products participate 
provisions for medicare part d rebates are estimated using a combination of specific terms of individual plan agreements  product and population growth  price increases and the impact of contracting strategies 
the estimated impact of this shift that is related to sales has been reflected in novogyne s sales accruals at the end of although the impact was relatively neutral to novogyne s products 
wholesaler chargebacks relate to contractual arrangements with certain indirect customers to sell products at prices that are lower than the list price charged to wholesalers 
a wholesaler chargeback represents the difference between the invoice price charged to the wholesaler and the indirect customer s contract discount price 
provisions for estimating chargebacks are calculated using a combination of historical experience  product growth rates and the specific terms in each agreement 
wholesaler chargebacks are generally settled within a few weeks of incurring the liability 
managed health care rebates are offered to key managed health care  group purchasing organizations and other direct and indirect customers to sustain and increase product market share 
these rebate programs provide that the customer receive a rebate after attaining certain performance parameters relating to product purchases  formulary status and or pre established market share milestones relative to competitors 
since rebates are contractually agreed upon  rebates are estimated based on the specific terms in each agreement  historical experience and product growth rates 
the sales performance of products subject to managed health care rebates and other contract discounts and levels of inventory in the distribution channel are tracked  and adjustments to the accrual are made periodically to reflect actual experience 
in order to evaluate adequacy of ending accrual balances  novogyne uses both internal and external estimates of the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time 
external data sources include periodic reports of wholesalers and purchased third party market data 
management internally estimates the inventory level in the retail channel and in transit 
it is customary in the pharmaceutical industry to allow returns of unused stocks with remaining shelf lives of six months or less 
novogyne s policy is that no product will be shipped to customers with less than nine months of remaining shelf life and novogyne generally will accept returns due to expiration within twelve months after the product has expired 
an allowance for estimated sales returns is recorded based on i the historical experience of actual product returns and ii the estimated lag time between when an actual sale takes place in relation to when the products are physically returned by a customer 
the historical actual returns rate is then applied to product sales during the estimated lag period to develop the returns estimate 
novogyne also considers trends and expectations for future demand and trade inventory levels 
these policies cause a significant lag time between when a product is sold and the latest date on which a return could occur 
novogyne believes this is a reasonable basis on which to estimate returns exposure and incorporates the key 
table of contents factors that contribute to returns 
in addition  novogyne establishes sales returns allowances for product that has been recalled or that it believes is probable of being recalled 
the methodology used to estimate product returns associated with recalls is based on the distribution and expiration dates of the affected product and overall trade inventory levels 
these estimates are based on currently available information  and the ultimate outcome may be different than the amounts estimated given the subjective nature and complexities inherent in this area and in the pharmaceutical industry 
novogyne s product supply policy is to maintain inventories on a consistent level from year to year based on the pattern of consumption 
wholesaler inventory levels are monitored monthly based on gross sales volume  prescription volumes based on third party data and information received from the key wholesalers 
based on this information  the inventories on hand at wholesalers and other distribution channels were estimated to be approximately one month at december  and novogyne believes the third party data sources of information are sufficiently reliable  however its accuracy cannot be independently verified 
cash discounts are offered to customers to encourage prompt payment 
cash discounts  which are typically of gross sales  are accrued at the time of sale 
other sales discounts  such as consumer coupons and discount cards  are also offered 
these discounts are recorded at the time of sale and estimated utilizing historical experience and the specific terms for each program 
novartis controls and maintains the reserves associated with such sales allowances and returns on behalf of novogyne and pays all monies owed and issues credits to individual customers as deemed necessary 
the contracts that underlie these transactions are maintained by novartis for its business as a whole and those transactions relating to novogyne are estimated by novartis 
based on an analysis of the underlying activity  the amounts recorded by novogyne represent novartis best estimate of charges that apply to sales by novogyne 
however  we can not control novartis analysis of the underlying activity or its application of that analysis to novogyne 
if novartis materially changes the assumptions it uses in determining the reserve  novogyne may be required to record an additional reserve allowance on its financial statements  which would adversely affect novogyne s operating results during the period in which the determination or reserve were made  and would consequently also reduce the earnings attributable to our investment in novogyne for that period 
novogyne loss contingencies novogyne is required to establish accruals for certain loss contingencies related to litigation  including product liability claims 
novogyne accrues estimated legal fees and settlement costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
accruals for product liability claims are recorded by novogyne  on an undiscounted basis  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information 
novogyne includes estimated legal fees in accruals for product liability claims and makes adjustments as new information becomes available 
receivables for insurance recoveries related to product liability claims under novogyne s third party insurance policy are recorded  on an undiscounted basis  when it is probable that a recovery will be realized

since july  novartis  along with various other pharmaceutical companies  has been named in a number of lawsuits involving novogyne s hormone replacement therapy products 
novogyne has established reserves in the amount of million as of december  for expected defense and settlement expenses related to pending lawsuits as well as for estimated future cases alleging use of novogyne s products 
in addition  novogyne has recorded an insurance receivable of million  which is novogyne s best estimate of the insurance coverage for recovery of claims 
novartis controls and maintains the accruals associated with such litigation on behalf of novogyne and pays all monies owed for legal fees and settlements  as well as collects any insurance recovery from policies in the name of novogyne 
the litigation accruals and estimated insurance recoveries are maintained by novartis for its business as a whole and those accruals and recoveries relating to novogyne are estimated by novartis based on claims specifically attributable to novogyne s products and novogyne s insurance policies 
based on an analysis of the underlying data  the amounts recorded by novogyne represent novartis best estimate of litigation accruals and estimated insurance recoveries relating to novogyne 
however  we can not control novartis analysis of the underlying data or its application of that analysis to novogyne 
litigation and its outcome are inherently difficult to predict 
any change in the estimates of number of cases  cost per case  allocation of cost between noven  novartis and novogyne  insurance recoveries and other assumptions could cause novogyne s and noven s financial results to significantly vary 
furthermore  if actual liability and insurance recoveries ultimately differ from that which has been recorded  novogyne s and noven s financial results in the period where the liability becomes payable and the insurance is recoverable could be materially affected by the adjustment of the liability and insurance recoveries

sab  which added section n to topic  financial statements  of the staff accounting bulletin series effective for fiscal years ending after november  section n provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying current year financial statement misstatements for the purpose of materiality assessment 
the sec concluded in sab that a registrant s materiality evaluation of an identified unadjusted error should quantify the impact of correcting all misstatements  including both the carryover and reversing effects of prior year misstatements  on the current year financial statements 
if either the carryover or reversing effects of prior year misstatements is material  the misstatements should be corrected in the current year 
if correcting an error in the current year for prior year misstatements causes the current year to be materially misstated  the prior year financial statements should be corrected  even though such

accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin to clarify the accounting for uncertainties related to income taxes that are recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation requires financial statement recognition of the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not to be sustained on examination  based on the technical merits of the position 
fin is effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after december   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on our results of operations and financial condition
