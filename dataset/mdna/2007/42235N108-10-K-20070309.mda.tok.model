item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements and the risk factors included elsewhere in this report 
overview general our primary business is providing bank card based payment processing services to merchants in the united states 
as of december   we provided our payment processing services to approximately  active bank card merchants located across the united states 
this represents a increase over the  active bank card merchants at december  our bank card processing volume for the year ended december  was billion  a increase from the billion processed during the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  our bank card processing volume was billion and billion  respectively 
we also provide payroll processing services throughout the united states 
at december  we processed payroll for  customers  an increase of from  payroll customers at december  our total merchants  which we define as bank card processing merchants plus payroll customers  increased to approximately  at december  this represents a increase over the  total merchants at december  we have developed a number of proprietary payment processing systems to increase our operating efficiencies and distribute our processing and merchant data to our three main constituencies our merchant base  our sales force and our customer service staff 
in  we began providing authorization and data capture services to our merchants through our own front end processing system  which we call hps exchange 
in  we began providing clearing  settlement and merchant accounting services through our own internally developed back end processing system  which we call passport 
passport enables us to customize these services to the needs of our relationship managers and merchants 
during the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our transactions were processed through hps exchange  which has decreased our operating costs per transaction 
we completed converting substantially all of our merchants to passport during the second quarter of  which also is expected to decrease our operating costs per transaction 
at december   approximately  of our active bank card merchants were processing on passport  compared to  at december  with our conversion to passport  our internally developed systems are providing substantially all aspects of most of our merchants processing needs 
previously  we relied on third party vendors for many of these services including bank card authorization and data capture services  settlement and merchant accounting services 
we will continue to process a minority of our transactions through third party front end systems 

table of contents our revenue is recurring in nature  as we typically enter into three year service contracts with our card processing merchants that  in order to qualify for the agreed upon pricing  require the merchant to achieve bank card processing volume minimums 
most of our revenue is payment processing fees  which are a combination of a fee equal to a percentage of the dollar amount of each visa or mastercard transaction we process plus a flat fee per transaction 
we make mandatory payments of interchange fees to card issuing banks through visa and mastercard and dues and assessment fees to visa and mastercard 
our business volume  and consequently gross processing revenue  is largely driven by the cumulative growth in the number of merchants with whom we have processing contracts 
this in turn is the result of the number of merchants that we install during a period  offset by the number of merchants who cease processing with us during that period 
we also generally benefit from consumers increasing use of bank cards in place of cash and checks 
significant increases in our sales force have led to significant growth in the number of total merchants for whom we process 
our sales managers are compensated based on their success in growing the sales force and increasing the total merchant base in their regions 
our sales force grew from at december   to  at december  and to  at december  the number of total merchants installed during year ended december  grew by approximately to  new merchants installed  compared to  new merchants installed during the year ended december  and  new merchants installed during the year ended december  in order to continue to increase our gross processing revenue  we intend to increase both the size and productivity of our sales force 
as a result of our commission only compensation system for our sales force  we are able to increase the size of our sales force with minimal upfront costs 
however  since we pay signing bonuses and commissions approximating of the gross margin generated by a merchant in its first year  growth in merchant accounts consumes significant capital  as it typically takes approximately one year s processing to cover the outlays for signing bonuses  commissions and payroll taxes 
same store sales growth  which represents the change in bank card processing volume for all bank card merchants that were processing with us in the same month a year earlier  grew in  down from growth of on average in and same store sales growth results from the combination of the increasing use by consumers of bank cards for the purchase of goods and services at the point of sale  and sales growth experienced by our retained bank card merchants 
we attribute the decline from the same store sales growth percentages that we experienced during and to a slowdown in the growth rate of retail sales  which was likely a result of the impact of rising energy costs and interest rates on the economy 
financial highlights for  we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  an increase from million  or per diluted share in our record financial performance in was primarily driven by strong growth in our bank card transaction processing volume  which led to a increase in our net revenue and a increase in our operating income  and by a reduction in our estimated effective annual tax rate 
net income for included the impacts of a million pre tax write off of purchased software  partially offset by a million pre tax gain for the proceeds received from a legal settlement 
net income for included the impacts of a million pre tax gain on the settlement of a financing arrangement  partially offset by pre tax charges of million to adjust the fair value of previously outstanding warrants with mandatory redemption provisions 
the following is a summary of our financial highlights for during  we installed  new bank card merchants  including  on hps exchange  which increased the number of active bank card merchants we service to  at december   an increase of over the number of bank card merchants we serviced at december  bank card processing volume during increased to billion from billion during net revenue  which is defined as total revenues less interchange fees and dues and assessments  increased to million in from million in the increase in net revenue was driven by the increases in installed merchants and bank card processing volume 
our income from operations  which we also refer to as operating income  grew by to million for from million for our operating margin  which is measured as operating income divided by net revenue  improved to for from for 
table of contents in connection with preparing our state income tax returns  we analyzed the approaches we applied for sourcing taxable income to individual states and benefited from revising our approaches to income sourcing in certain of those states 
we revised those state income sourcing approaches in the third quarter of  and as a result  we realized reductions of our state income tax expense and our estimated effective annual state tax rates 
our overall estimated effective annual tax rate for was  compared to in for  we expect our overall estimated effective annual tax rate to be approximately 
components of revenues and expenses revenues 
our revenues fall into three categories gross processing revenue  payroll processing revenue and equipment related income 
our gross processing revenue primarily consists of discount  per transaction and periodic primarily monthly fees from the processing of bank card transactions  primarily visa and mastercard transactions  for merchants 
these fees are negotiated by our relationship managers with each merchant 
gross processing revenue also includes american express and discover fees  customer service fees  fees for processing chargebacks  termination fees on terminated contracts  and other miscellaneous revenue 
payroll processing revenue includes fees charged by our subsidiary  heartland payroll company  for payroll processing services  including check printing  direct deposit  related federal  state and local tax deposits and providing accounting documentation and interest income earned on funds held for customers 
equipment related income includes revenues from the sale  rental and deployment of bank card terminals  and since january   from the sale of hardware  software and associated services for prepaid card and stored value card payment systems 
revenues are recorded at the time of shipment  or the provision of service 
most of these revenue items will tend to grow with our merchant growth 
expenses 
our most significant expense is interchange fees  which are set by the visa and mastercard card networks  and are paid to the card issuing banks 
interchange fees are calculated as a percentage of the dollar volume processed plus a per transaction fee 
we also pay visa and mastercard network dues and assessments  which are calculated as a percentage of the dollar volume processed 
interchange fees and dues and assessments are recognized at the time transactions are processed 
it is our policy to pass along to our merchants any changes in interchange fees and card association dues and assessments 
since the card networks regularly adjust those rates  our gross processing revenue will increase or decrease  but all the impact will be paid to the card issuing banks and our income from operations will not be affected 
costs of services also include processing and servicing costs  customer acquisition costs  and depreciation and amortization 
processing and servicing costs include processing costs  which are either paid to third parties  including our bank sponsor  or represent the cost of our own authorization capture and accounting settlement systems 
during  third party costs represented about of our processing costs  with internal costs representing the remainder 
during  third party costs represented about of our processing costs  compared to during approximately  and  respectively  of our third party processing costs in  and were paid to tsys acquiring solutions  residual commission payments to our relationship managers  sales managers and trade associations  agent banks and value added resellers  which are a percentage of the gross margin we generated from our merchant contracts during the accounting period  the costs of operating our service center  including telecommunications costs  personnel costs  occupancy costs  losses due to merchant defaults  and other direct merchant servicing  and the costs of bank card terminals  prepaid card and stored value hardware deployed  and merchant supplies 
customer acquisition costs reflect the amortization over the initial three year contract term of the cash signing bonus paid and the deferred acquisition costs for vested relationship managers and sales managers  as well as changes in the accrued buyout liability  which reflect the impact of buying out residual commissions see critical accounting estimates accrued buyout liability and volume attrition 
depreciation and amortization expenses are primarily recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 
we have made significant capital expenditures for computer hardware and software and such costs are generally depreciated over three to five years 
general and administrative expenses include salaries and wages and other administrative expenses 
the two most significant elements in these expenses are our information technology infrastructure costs and our marketing expenses 
beginning january   general and administrative expenses also include expenses recorded for share based compensation under sfas no 
r 

table of contents other income expense consists of interest income on cash and investments  the interest cost on our borrowings  the gains or losses on the disposal of property  plant and equipment and other non recurring income or expense items 
other income expense also includes a gain from the proceeds received from a legal settlement in  and in  a gain on the settlement of a financing arrangement and charges for adjustments to the fair value of previously outstanding warrants with mandatory redemption provisions 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the critical accounting estimates described here are those that are most important to the depiction of our financial condition and results of operations  including those whose application requires management s most subjective judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the line items on our income statement and balance sheet impacted by management s estimates are described below 
revenues historically  we have paid to of our gross processing revenue as interchange fees to the card issuing banks 
certain of our competitors report their revenue net of interchange fees 
this is because the issuing banks make their payments to these competitors net of those interchange fees  and these acquirers pay this reduced amount to their merchants 
we do not offset gross processing revenue and interchange fees because our business practice is to fund the interchange fee or to arrange for our sponsor bank to advance the interchange fees to most of our merchants when settling their transactions thus paying the full amount of the transaction to the merchant  and then to collect our full discount fees from our merchants on the first business day of the next month 
we believe this policy aids in new business generation  as our merchants benefit from bookkeeping simplicity 
however  it results in our carrying a large receivable from our merchants at each period end  and a corresponding but smaller payable to our sponsor bank  both of which are settled on the first business day after the period end 
as we are at risk for the receivables  we record the associated revenues on a gross processing revenue basis in our income statements 
capitalized customer acquisition costs capitalized customer acquisition costs consist of up front signing bonuses paid to relationship managers and sales managers  referred to as the salesperson or salespersons  for the establishment of new merchant relationships  and deferred acquisition cost representing the estimated cost of buying out the commissions of vested salespersons at some point in the future 
pursuant to staff accounting bulletin topic  revenue recognition  and the financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin no 
 accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts  capitalized customer acquisition costs represent incremental  direct customer acquisition costs that are recoverable through gross margins associated with merchant contracts 
the capitalized customer acquisition costs are amortized using a method which approximates a proportional revenue approach over the initial three year term of the merchant contract 
the amount of the up front signing bonus paid for new bank card merchant accounts is based on the estimated gross margin calculated by deducting interchange fees  dues and assessments and all costs incurred in underwriting  processing and servicing an account from gross processing revenue for the first year of the merchant contract 
the gross signing bonuses paid during  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the signing bonus paid  amount capitalized  and related amortization are adjusted at the end of the first year to reflect the actual gross margin generated by the merchant contract during that year 
the net signing bonus adjustments made during  and were million  million and million  respectively 
negative signing bonus adjustments result from the prior overpayment of signing bonuses  which are recovered from the relevant salesperson 
the amount of signing bonuses paid which remained subject to adjustment at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the deferred acquisition cost is accrued over the first year of merchant processing  consistent with the build up in the accrued buyout liability  which is described below 

table of contents management evaluates the capitalized customer acquisition costs for impairment at each balance sheet date by comparing  on a pooled basis by vintage month of origination  the expected future net cash flows from underlying merchant relationships to the carrying amount of the capitalized customer acquisition costs 
if the estimated future net cash flows are lower than the recorded carrying amount  indicating an impairment of the value of the capitalized customer acquisition costs  the impairment loss will be charged to operations 
we have not recognized an impairment loss in  or accrued buyout liability we pay our salespersons residual commissions based on the gross margin generated from the monthly processing activity of merchants signed by them 
a portion  typically of the residual commissions we owe to the salesperson  is deemed to be a servicing fee and is not accrued as a liability 
for the remainder of their residual commissions referred to as the owned portion of such commissions  or portfolio equity the salesperson has no obligation to perform services and will receive commissions as long as the merchant continues processing with us 
we accrue the buyout liability  which represents the estimated current settlement cost of buying out all vested and expected to vest salespersons for the owned portion of such commissions 
we also record a deferred acquisition cost asset related to those buyouts  and amortize that asset as an expense over the initial year contract term 
we consider a salesperson to be vested once they have established merchant relationships that generate the equivalent of  of monthly gross margin 
vested status entitles the salesperson to his or her residual commissions for as long as the merchant processes with us  even if the salesperson is no longer employed by us 
the accrued buyout liability is based on the merchants we have under contract at the balance sheet date  the gross margin we generated from those accounts in the prior twelve months  the owned commission rate  and the fixed buyout multiple of times the commissions 
the liability related to a new merchant is therefore zero when the merchant is installed  and increases over the twelve months following the installation date 
for unvested salespersons  the accrued buyout liability is accrued over the expected vesting period  however  no deferred acquisition cost is capitalized as future services are required in order to vest 
in calculating the accrued buyout liability for unvested salespersons  we have assumed that of unvested salespersons will vest in the future  which represents our historical vesting rate 
a increase to in the expected vesting rate would have increased the accrued buyout liability for unvested salespersons by million at december  and buyout payments made to salespersons reduce the outstanding accrued buyout liability 
given our view of the duration of the cash flows associated with a pool of merchant contracts  we believe that the benefits of such buyouts significantly exceed the cost  which typically represents to years of commissions 
if the cash flows associated with a pool of bought out contracts does not exceed this cost  we will incur an economic loss on our decision to buyout the contracts 
during  and  we made buyout payments of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
included in the million of buyout payments in was million used by salespersons who participated in the pepshares plan to exercise their options to acquire  shares of our common stock 
in  we processed fewer buyouts as a result of contract modifications and our initial public offering process 
we expect to make significant buyout payments in the future  subject to cash availability  as such buyouts reduce the monthly payments we will have to make to our salespersons for such merchants in the future 
chargebacks  reject losses and merchant deposits disputes between a cardholder and a merchant periodically arise as a result of  among other things  the cardholder s dissatisfaction with merchandise quality or merchant services 
such disputes may not be resolved in the merchant s favor 
in these cases  the transaction is charged back to the merchant  which means the purchase price is refunded to the customer by the card issuing bank and charged to the merchant 
if the merchant is unable to fund the refund  we must do so 
if the salesperson who installed the merchant is still employed by us  that salesperson bears a portion of this loss through a reduction in our payment of residual commissions or signing bonuses to such relationship manager 
we also bear the risk of reject losses arising from the fact that we collect our fees from our merchants on the first day after the monthly billing period 
if the merchant has gone out of business during such period  we may be unable to collect such fees 
we maintain cash deposits or require the pledge of a letter of credit from 
table of contents certain merchants  generally those with higher average transaction size where the card is not present when the charge is made or the product or service is delivered after the charge is made  in order to offset potential contingent liabilities such as chargebacks and reject losses that would arise if the merchant went out of business 
at december  and  we held merchant deposits totaling million and million  respectively 
most chargeback and reject losses are charged to processing and servicing as they are incurred 
however  we also maintain a loss reserve against losses including major fraud losses  which are both less predictable and involve larger amounts 
the loss reserve was established using historical loss rates  applied to recent bank card processing volume 
at december  and  our loss reserve totaled  aggregate merchant losses  including losses charged to operations and the loss reserve  were   and  for  and  respectively 
stock options we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r on january  this statement revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and its related implementation guidance 
the most significant change resulting from this statement is the requirement for public companies to expense employee share based payments under the fair value method 
pursuant to sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
we elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method  as provided by sfas no 
r 
accordingly  prior period amounts have not been restated 
under this transitional method  the company is required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption using grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards using the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we estimate the grant date fair value of the stock options we issue using a black scholes valuation model 
we determine an expected volatility assumption by referencing the average volatility experienced by six of our public company peers 
we used an average of a peer group because we do not have sufficient historical volatility data related to market trading of our own common stock 
we estimate the expected life of a stock option based on the simplified method for plain vanilla stock options as provided by the staff of the sec in staff accounting bulletin the simplified method is used because  at this point  we do not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns 
our dividend yield assumption is based on actual dividends expected to be paid over the expected life of the stock option 
our risk free interest rate assumption for stock options granted is determined by using us treasury rates of the same period as the expected option term of each stock option 
the weighted average fair value of options we granted during  and were  and  respectively 
the fair value of options granted during  and was estimated at the grant date using the following weighted average assumptions expected volatility expected life to years years to years dividends risk free interest rate 
table of contents prior to adopting sfas no 
r  we accounted for stock options using the intrinsic value method under apb no 
in which no compensation expense has been recognized for share based compensation plans 
amounts we recognized in our financial statements during the years ended december   and with respect to share based compensation plans were as follows in thousands year ended december  compensation expense recognized on share based plans before income tax benefit related income tax benefit recognized in the income statement cash received from stock option exercises excess tax benefit recorded for tax deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options tax benefit realized as reductions of estimated tax payments during the period additionally  sfas no 
r amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows sfas no 
 to require the excess tax benefits to be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than a reduction of taxes paid  which is included within operating cash flows 
accordingly  cash provided by operating activities decreased and cash provided by financing activities increased by million related to excess tax benefits from share based awards 
we realized million of that amount as reductions of estimated income tax payments during the year ended december  the excess tax benefits result from employees exercising non qualified stock options and making disqualifying dispositions of shares acquired through their exercise of incentive stock options 
the application of sfas no 
r had the following effects on reported amounts relative to amounts that we would have reported using the intrinsic value method under apb no

under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the effects of differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities for financial reporting and for income tax purposes 
judgments are required in determining the amount and probability of future taxable income  which in turn is critical to a determination of whether a valuation reserve against the deferred tax asset is appropriate

total revenues increased from million in to  million in  primarily as a result of a increase in our gross card processing revenue from million in to  million in our bank card processing volume for increased to billion  compared to billion for the increases in gross processing revenue and bank card processing volume were primarily attributable to a net increase in bank card merchant accounts  with the number of bank card merchant accounts growing by approximately from  as of december  to  as of december  the increase in new bank card merchant accounts during this period was primarily the result of the growth in our sales force  combined with improved production from our existing sales force as previous additions to the sales force gain experience and seasoning 
total revenues also include payroll processing fees and equipment related income 
payroll processing fees increased by from million in to million in primarily due to the increase in the number of payroll processing customers from  at december  to  at december  equipment related income increased by million  from million in to in  primarily due to the increase in the number of new card processing merchants installed and million of revenues contributed by debitek  which we acquired as of january  costs of services

the change in estimate was based on new information which became available to us 
interchange expense in also included interchange adjustments we paid to our bank card merchants resulting from our conversion to passport

as a percentage of total revenue  dues and assessments declined from in to in net revenue  which is defined as total revenues less interchange fees and dues and assessments  increased from million in to million in processing and servicing expense for increased by million  or  compared with the increase in processing and servicing expense was due primarily to i costs associated with increased bank card processing volume  ii increases in the cost of bank card terminals  prepaid card and stored value hardware deployed including million for the costs of debitek equipment deployed  iii a million increase in residual commission payments to our salespersons related to their portion of the growth in our gross margin  and iv increases in the costs of operating our service center  particularly the costs of support personnel and depreciation and amortization 
as a percentage of total revenue  processing and servicing expense was for compared with for the increase in processing and servicing as a percentage of total revenue for was driven by the costs of bank card terminals  prepaid card and stored value hardware deployed and the inclusion of service center depreciation and amortization  and was partially mitigated by leveraging the lower costs of our internally developed front end processing system  hps exchange  and cost savings associated with our back end processing system  passport 
transactions processed on hps exchange represented approximately of our total processing transactions during compared to during we expect the increasing share of hps exchange in our total bank card merchant base to continue in the future 
as of may   our conversion to our internally developed back end processing system  passport  was substantially complete 
we expect to realize the lower cost benefits of processing on passport in future periods 
included in processing and servicing expense was million of payroll processing costs in  which increased from the increase in payroll processing costs included  for commission payments to our salespersons 
customer acquisition costs increased from million in to million in customer acquisition costs include net amortization of signing bonuses  which increased from million in to million in  and amortization of capitalized customer deferred acquisition costs  which grew from million in to million in increases in new merchant account installations and the related bank card processing volume were primarily responsible for the increases in the amortization of both signing bonuses and capitalized customer deferred acquisition costs 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to the purchase of information technology equipment to support the network and the continuing development of hps exchange and passport 
additionally  we capitalized salaries and fringe benefits and other expenses incurred by employees that worked on internally developed software projects 
amortization does not begin on the internally developed software until the project is complete and placed in service  at which time we begin to amortize the asset over three to five years 
the amount capitalized decreased from million in to million in the total amount of capitalized projects placed in service in and was million and million  respectively 
beginning january   depreciation and amortization expense associated with our servicing center was included in processing and servicing expense 
for  service center related depreciation and amortization expense was million 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to added costs necessary to continue building our corporate  information technology and marketing infrastructure to support our growth 

table of contents also contributing to the increase in general and administrative expenses in was million we paid for matching payroll tax expense related to gains employees realized on their exercise of non qualified stock options  million of general and administrative expenses incurred by debitek  and million for sfas no 
r share based compensation expense 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue declined from for to for  as revenue growth outpaced the increase in general and administrative expenses 
our payroll operation s general and administrative expenses increased by from million in to million in income from operations 
for the reasons described above  our income from operations  which we also refer to as operating income  improved from million for to million for our operating margin  which is measured as operating income divided by net revenue  was for  compared to for our operating income and operating margin for was unfavorably impacted by the million recorded for the change in estimate of debit interchange expense  excluding that amount  our operating margin would have been for interest income 
interest income increased from  in to million in  due primarily to an increase in the amount of cash available for investment and higher interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased from million in to  in most of our interest expense arises from the practice of having our sponsor bank advance interchange fees to most of our merchants 
in august  we began using a portion of our available cash to fund these advances 
these advances to our merchants are funded first with our cash available for investment  then by incurring a payable to our sponsor bank when that cash has been expended 
we pay the sponsor bank the prime rate on these payables 
the payable to the sponsor bank is repaid at the beginning of the following month out of the processing fees we collect from our bank card merchants 
interest expense in also included  of interest expense recorded on a revolver advance facility and line of credit which we paid off in august using proceeds from our initial public offering 
fair value adjustment for warrants with mandatory redemption provisions 
we recognized expense of million during to adjust the warrants carrying value to per share  the closing price of our common stock on the day prior to the exercise of the warrants 
the warrants were exercised on august  gain on settlement of financing arrangement 
on september   we reacquired the remaining  merchant contracts we had previously transferred to certegy inc in a transaction accounted for as a financing arrangement 
we made a cash payment of million  fully extinguishing our obligations under the financing arrangement 
the outstanding balance of this financing arrangement at the time of extinguishment was million  resulting in a pre tax gain on the settlement of a financing arrangement of million in other  net 
other expense of  was recorded in  compared to other income of  in other expense in primarily reflected a million write off of purchased software as well as a million gain from the proceeds received from a legal settlement in the first quarter of other income in primarily related to a cash settlement we received in connection with a lawsuit against an equipment supplier 
income tax 
income taxes for were million reflecting an effective tax rate of 
this represented a reduction from an effective tax rate of for  which resulted in income tax expense of million 
the reduction in the effective tax rate was due to revising state income sourcing approaches in the third quarter of and the impact of the fair value adjustment for warrants included in as a result of revising state income sourcing approaches in the third quarter of  we realized reductions of our state income tax expense and our estimated effective annual state tax rates

since our sales force is commission based  increases in processing income directly impact commissions included in costs of services 
processing and servicing as a percentage of total revenue decreased primarily due to leveraging the lower costs of our internally developed front end processing system  hps exchange 
over of new merchants installed during were installed on hps exchange  and we completed some conversions from other front end processors  so that transactions processed on hps exchange represented approximately of our total processing transactions in  up from in we expect the increasing share of hps exchange in our total merchant base to continue in the future 
in addition  processing and servicing as a percentage of total revenues decreased due to growth in residual commissions that was slower than revenue growth  primarily due to portfolio buyouts 
included in processing and servicing expense was million of payroll processing costs in  which increased from million in customer acquisition costs increased from million in to million in the net amortization of signing bonuses increased from million in to million in  while the amortization of capitalized customer deferred acquisition costs grew from million in to million in increases in new merchant account installations and bank card processing volume were primarily responsible for the increases in the amortization of both the capitalized customer deferred acquisition costs and signing bonuses 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to the purchase of information technology equipment to support the network and the development of hps exchange and passport  which is our own internally developed back end processing system 
additionally  we capitalized salaries and fringe benefits and other expenses incurred by employees that worked on internally developed software projects 
amortization does not begin on the internally developed software until the project is complete and placed in service  at which time we begin to amortize the asset over three to five years 
the amount capitalized increased from million in to million in the total amount of capitalized projects placed in service in and was million and million  respectively 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to added costs necessary to continue building our corporate and marketing infrastructure to support our growth 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue declined from in to in  as revenue growth outpaced the increase in general and administrative expenses 
our payroll operation s general and administrative expenses increased by from million in to million in income from operations 
for the reasons described above  our income from operations  which we also refer to as operating income  improved from million for to million for our operating margin  which is measured as operating income divided by net revenue  improved from for to for interest income 
interest income increased from  in to  in  due primarily to increased interest rates as well as interest earned on cash proceeds from our initial public offering 
interest expense 
interest expense increased from million in to million in most of our interest expense arises from the practice of having our sponsor bank advance interchange fees to most of our merchants 
in august  we began using a portion of our available cash to fund these merchant advances 
in future periods  we intend these advances to our merchants to 
table of contents be funded first with our available cash  then by incurring a payable to our sponsor bank when that cash has been expended 
we pay the sponsor bank the prime rate on our payable 
the payable to the sponsor bank is repaid at the beginning of the following month out of the fees we collect from our merchants 
the payable was higher on average in due to increased bank card processing volume  and the prime rate charged on the average payable has increased significantly from to the impact that higher average balances payable to the sponsor bank had on interest expense was partially offset by decreases in interest expense resulting from repayments of our revolver advance facility and line of credit using proceeds from our initial public offering  and reductions in borrowings under financing arrangements as the outstanding balance declined from million as of december  to million as of december   as well as our partial funding of the merchant advances after our initial public offering 
fair value adjustment for warrants with mandatory redemption provisions 
we recognized expense of million in to adjust the warrants carrying value to per share  the closing price of our common stock on the day prior to the exercise of the warrants 
the adjustment recorded in was million 
gain on settlement of financing arrangement 
on september   we reacquired the remaining  merchant contracts previously transferred to certegy inc in a transaction accounted for as a financing arrangement 
we made a cash payment of million  fully extinguishing our obligations under the financing arrangement 
the outstanding balance of this financing arrangement at the time of extinguishment was million  resulting in a pre tax gain on the settlement of a financing arrangement of million in other  net 
other  net income of million was recorded in  compared to other net income of million in other  net income in primarily related to a cash settlement we received in connection with a lawsuit against an equipment supplier 
most of the income in was attributable to a payment we received in connection with the settlement of a lawsuit we had initiated to collect on an insurance policy we had in income tax 
income taxes for were million using an effective tax rate of 
this represented an increase from the effective rate for  which resulted in taxes of million 
the increase in our effective tax rate for resulted from recording a non deductible fair value adjustment for warrants

cash and cash equivalents increased by million or as the result of cash flow see liquidity and capital resources for more detail 
current tax assets increased million primarily due to recognizing a current tax asset of million during reflecting tax benefits we realized as reductions of estimated tax payments in and benefits that we will realize by recapturing taxes paid in and recovering the estimated tax payments we made during these tax benefits reflect tax deductions which accrued to us when our employees exercised non qualified stock options and made disqualifying dispositions of shares acquired through the exercise of incentive stock options during receivables  which primarily result from our practice of advancing interchange fees to most of our merchants during the processing month and collecting those fees from our merchants at the beginning of the following month  increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase in receivables from merchants was primarily due to the impact of an increase in december monthly bank card processing volume over december monthly bank card processing volume 
for the month of december  our bank card processing volume was billion  compared to bank card processing volume of billion during the month of december in august  we began using our available cash to fund a portion of the advances of interchange fees to our merchants 
these advances to our merchants are funded first with our cash available for investment  then by incurring a payable to our sponsor bank when that cash has been expended 
at december   we used million of our available cash to fund merchant advances 
the amount due to our sponsor bank was million at december  and million at december  the payable to our sponsor bank is repaid at the beginning of the following month out of the fees we collect from our merchants 
capitalized customer acquisition costs increased million  or  from december  as a result of increases in the number of merchants we service 
funds held for payroll customers increased million  or  from december  as a result of growth in the number of payroll customers 
property and equipment increased million  or  due to continued building of our technology infrastructure  primarily for hardware and software needed for the expansion of hps exchange and passport 
we also commenced construction of our new service center in jeffersonville  indiana and spent million in total stockholders equity increased million from december  primarily due to tax benefits recorded in additional paid in capital related to employees exercise of stock options and related tax benefits  which contributed million  and our net income of million recorded in  less million for dividends declared on common stock 
an increase in stockholders equity for proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options  which amounted to million  was mostly offset by the purchase of  treasury shares at a cost of million 
liquidity and capital resources general 
liquidity and capital resource management is a process focused on providing the funding we need to meet our short and long term cash and working capital needs 
we have used our funding sources to build our merchant portfolio and our servicing technology platforms with the expectation that these investments will generate cash flows sufficient to cover our working capital needs and other anticipated needs for capital 
our cash requirements include funding payments to salespersons for signing bonuses  residual commissions and residual buyouts  paying interest expense and other operating expenses  including taxes  constructing our new service center and investing in building our infrastructure 
at times  we have used cash to repurchase our common stock 
we could in the future use cash for other unspecified acquisitions of related businesses or assets 
in february  we acquired debitek  a prepaid card and stored value card solutions provider  for a net cash payment of million 
the acquisition of debitek provides us with a proven platform in the stored value and prepaid cards market  particularly with respect to small dollar payment applications 
this acquisition is not expected to have a material impact on earnings in the near term 

table of contents our cash needs are funded primarily by cash flow from our operating activities and our agreement with our sponsor bank to fund merchant advances 
we believe that our current cash and investment balances  cash generated from operations and our agreement with our sponsor bank to fund merchant advances will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our anticipated needs for capital for at least the next twelve months  and currently anticipate no liquidity challenges over a longer term 
our working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  was positive at december  and december  and grew by million in each funding source and use is described in more detail below 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million  compared to cash and cash equivalents of million at december  and million at december  cash flow used in provided by operating activities 
we reported net cash used in operating activities of million in and million in  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in our reported cash flow from operating activities for was unfavorably impacted by our adoption of sfas no

 statement of cash flow  as amended 
with the adoption of these statements  the amount of tax benefits resulting from employees exercising non qualified stock options and making disqualifying dispositions of shares acquired through their exercise of incentive stock options exceeding the amount of sfas no 
r compensation cost recognized referred to as excess tax benefits in this document  are classified as a cash inflow from financing activities on our statement of cash flow and a cash outflow from operating activities 
for  our operating cash flow was reduced by the classification of million of excess tax benefits as cash inflow from financing activities 
the following table presents the components of our cash flow from operating activities for  compared with and this table includes a breakout of the million of excess tax benefits showing the million portion of excess tax benefits which reduced actual estimated tax payments we made during this million reduction of estimated tax payments would have been classified as cash inflow from financing activities under the previous cash flow presentation requirements of apb no 
the table also shows the million of excess tax benefits which are a current tax receivable as of december  and are expected to be realized as reductions of future period estimated tax payments 
before reducing our cash flows from operating activities for the million current tax receivable  our cash flow from operations for would have been a positive million

table of contents we experienced negative cash flow from operating activities in because we used approximately million of the cash proceeds we received from our initial public offering  which was cash provided by a financing activity  to fund advances of interchange fees to our merchants and to pay down our payable to our sponsor bank  both of which derive from an operating activity as described below 
key sources of operating cash flows were our net income as adjusted for deferred taxes  depreciation and amortization  and share based compensation expense 
other major determinants of operating cash flow are net signing bonus payments  which consume increasing amounts of operating cash as our new merchant installation activity rises  and payouts on the accrued buyout liability  which represent the costs of buying out residual commissions owned by our salespersons 
see critical accounting estimates capitalized customer acquisition costs and critical accounting estimates accrued buyout liability for more information 
net signing bonuses of million  million and million  respectively  were paid in  and in  and  we reduced the accrued buyout liability by making buyout payments of million  million and million  respectively

contained within changes in operating assets and liabilities are the changes in receivables  due to sponsor bank and accounts payable 
in august  we began using our available cash to fund a portion of the advances of interchange fees to our merchants  thereby using operating cash to pay down our payable to our sponsor bank 
advances to our merchants  which generate a receivable from our merchants  are funded first with our available cash  then by incurring a payable to our sponsor bank when that cash has been expended 
the payable to the sponsor bank is repaid at the beginning of the following month out of the fees we collect from our merchants 
cash flow used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in and million in in january  we made a million strategic investment in convertible preferred stock issued by parcxmart technologies  inc parcxmart 
this investment solidified our marketing alliance with parcxmart under which we provide merchant acquirer services and offer bank card processing services to those merchants who use parcxmart s smart card payment system 
in february  we made a net cash payment of million to acquire debitek  inc during each period  we used cash to fund capital expenditures 
total capital expenditures for were million  compared to million invested in and million invested in these expenditures were primarily related to the continued building of our technology infrastructure  primarily for hardware and software needed for the expansion of hps exchange and passport 
we anticipate that these expenditures may increase as we further develop our technology 
in  we also spent million on the construction of our new service center facility 
see contractual obligations for more detail regarding expected funding requirements related to our new service center 
in addition  our subsidiary  heartland payroll company  has invested a portion of the cash balances it held in securities that are classified on our balance sheet as investments available for sale

on august   our board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock in the open market using proceeds from the issuance of stock options 
this authorization is in addition to the  common shares which the board of directors had authorized on january  under these authorizations  we repurchased  shares of our common stock during at a cost of million  or per share 
we intend to use these authorizations to repurchase shares opportunistically as a means of offsetting dilution from shares issued upon the exercise of options under employee benefit plans 
we have no obligation to repurchase shares under the authorization  and the specific timing and amount of the stock repurchase will vary based on market conditions  securities law limitations and other factors

we had no outstanding obligations under any credit facility at december  or on august   we had signed a loan and security agreement with keybank national association for two loan instruments 
we had amended this agreement on november   june   and may  the agreement was amended twice to reflect changes we made in our accounting policies 
the first instrument was a revolver advance facility  which we used solely to fund the buyouts of residual commissions from our salespersons 
borrowings on the revolver could not exceed  
table of contents the revolver accrued interest at a rate equal to the prime rate and was secured by a lien against our assets 
we repaid the entire outstanding principal balance of million plus all accrued interest and fees on august  and the revolver expired in accordance with its terms 
the second instrument was a purpose and ability line of credit totaling million  which was payable on demand 
the line of credit accrued interest at the prime rate and was secured by a lien on our assets

contractual obligations 
the visa and mastercard networks generally allow chargebacks up to four months after the later of the date the transaction is processed or the delivery of the product or service to the cardholder 
if the merchant incurring the chargeback is unable to fund the refund to the card issuing bank  we must do so 
as the majority of our transactions involve the delivery of the product or service at the time of the transaction  a good basis to estimate our exposure to chargebacks is the last four months bank card processing volume on our portfolio  which was billion  billion and billion for the four months ended december   and  respectively 
however  during the four months ended december   and  we were presented with million  million and million  respectively  of chargebacks by issuing banks 
in  and  we incurred merchant credit losses related to chargebacks of   and  respectively  on total dollar volume processed of billion  billion and billion  respectively 
these credit losses are included in processing and servicing expense in our consolidated statements of income 
the following table reflects our significant contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years more than years in thousands processing providers a financing arrangement expected payments  including interest telecommunications providers office and equipment leases land  construction and equipment b a we have agreements with several third party processors to provide to us on a non exclusive basis payment processing and transmittal  transaction authorization and data capture services  and access to various reporting tools 
these third party processors include tsys acquiring solutions  keybank  na  first data corporation  chase paymentech solutions and global payments  inc our agreements with third party processors require us to submit a minimum monthly number of transactions or volume for processing 
if we submit a number of transactions or volume that is lower than the minimum  we are required to pay them the fees that they would have received if we had submitted the required minimum number or volume of transactions 
b these amounts relate to contractual commitments we have for developing land and constructing our new service center in jeffersonville  indiana 
additional contractual commitments will be entered into as we progress with the development of this site 
through december   we have spent approximately million of our cash on our new service center  including million to acquire land  and over the next fifteen months we expect to spend approximately million more on its development  including the contractual obligations in the above table 
we are currently considering alternative credit facilities with several financial institutions for financing these development costs 
in addition  we record a payable to keybank each month in conjunction with our monthly processing activities 
this amount was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
this amount is repaid on the first business day of the following month out of the fees collected from our merchants

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
during each month  keybank advances interchange fees to most of our merchants 
we fund these advances first by applying a portion of our available cash and then by incurring a significant payable to keybank  bearing interest at the prime rate 
at december   our payable to keybank was million
