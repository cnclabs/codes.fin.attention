readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business 
background and overview we design  develop  market and support high performance object database management systems and provide related maintenance and professional services 
our products and services address the complex data management needs of enterprises and providers of products requiring data management functions 
our products and services collectively comprise our single operating segment  which we call data management 
our products are typically used by customers to manage data for business systems and enable these systems to access and integrate data necessary for the customers data management applications 
our data management products and services offer customers the ability to manage real time  xml and other types of hierarchical and navigational data 
we believe that by using our data management solutions  customers cut their hardware costs  accelerate and simplify their development  significantly reduce administration costs and deliver products with a significant competitive edge 
our data management business is currently comprised of the following key products versant object database  previously vds  a seventh generation object database management system that is used in high performance large scale real time applications 
our former product  versant enjin  has been replaced by versant object database using java data object jdo and the java persistence api language interface 
we also offer several optional ancillary products for use with versant object database to provide compatibility and additional protection of stored data 
fastobjects  an object oriented database management system that can be embedded as a high performance component into customers applications and systems 
our versant object database product offerings are used primarily by larger organizations  such as technology providers  telecommunications carriers  government defense agencies and defense contractors  healthcare companies and companies in the financial services and transportation industries  each of which have significant large scale data management requirements 
versant jdo  a product that we introduced in fiscal  as part of the technology we acquired in june from jdo genie  has now been absorbed and integrated into the versant product family and is no longer sold as standalone product 
with the incorporation of poet s fastobjects solution into our product line following our march merger with poet  we have expanded the scope of our solutions to also address data management needs of smaller business systems 
our customers data management needs can involve many business functions  ranging from management of the use and sharing of a company s internal enterprise data to the processing of externally originated information such as customer enrollment  billing and payment transaction data 
our solutions have also been used to solve complex data management issues such as fraud detection  risk analysis and yield management 
in addition to our product offerings  to assist users in developing and deploying applications based on versant object database and fastobjects  we offer a variety of services  including consulting  training and technical support services 
we license our products and sell associated maintenance  training and consulting services to end users through our direct sales force and through value added resellers  systems integrators and distributors 
in addition to these products and services  we resell related software developed by third parties 
to date  substantially all of our revenues have been derived from the following data management products and related services sales of licenses for versant object database and fastobjects  maintenance and technical support services for our products  consulting services versant and poet consulting practice and training services  nonrecurring engineering fees received in connection with providing services associated with versant object database  the resale of licenses  and maintenance  training and consulting services for third party products that complement versant object database  reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses  which we incurred and are recorded as revenues in our statement of operations 
financial highlights for fiscal our net revenues in fiscal were million  an increase of  or from net revenues of million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to closing several significant transactions with existing customers of both our european and north american operations during fiscal we depend heavily on our installed customer base for future revenues from licenses of additional products or upgrades of existing products and related maintenance renewal fees 
net income for fiscal was million compared to a net loss of million in fiscal in fiscal  we incurred impairment charges of million related to goodwill and intangible assets and restructuring charges of  in fiscal  we incurred no impairment charges and incurred restructuring charges of our combined sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  a decrease of million or from million in fiscal  primarily due to cost reductions associated with our restructuring activities initiated in the third quarter of fiscal and completed in the second quarter of fiscal these substantial cost reductions were a significant factor in our achieving profitability in fiscal cash provided by operations in fiscal was million compared to  of cash provided by operations in fiscal  primarily due to higher net income as a result of cost reductions related to the company s restructuring efforts 
during fiscal  our cash and cash equivalents balance increased by million to million at october  compared to million at october  fiscal and beyond during fiscal  our primary focus was on the following areas continued execution of a restructuring plan begun in fiscal to substantially reduce our ongoing operating expenses by consolidating our product lines and streamlining engineering  marketing  sales and administrative resources 
the purpose of the restructuring was to increase our ability to achieve net income and to refocus our business back to our core object database product offerings 
in february  we sold our websphere consulting business in exchange for a one time cash payment plus certain contingent earn out payments during a month period following the close of the transaction 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for more information 
we also focused our sales and marketing efforts on our data management products  versant object database and fastobjects  and related maintenance  consulting and training services 
versant object database  and its predecessor vds  were the key focus of our marketing efforts and the major source of our license revenues in fiscal we expect to derive most of our revenues in fiscal from versant object database and fastobjects licenses and related services 
like many other software companies  we do not operate with a significant backlog of orders 
our license revenues  in particular  are difficult to forecast 
we believe that information technology spending  particularly in the us  has been relatively depressed over the recent years and customers manifest very conservative purchasing behavior 
we expect higher license and maintenance revenues and lower consulting revenues for fiscal  which we expect to result in comparable total revenues to fiscal the projected decrease in consulting revenues is primarily due to a significant european consulting arrangement in fiscal not expected to repeat in fiscal we anticipate higher license and maintenance revenues in fiscal  as we have a higher level of dedicated resources and sales personnel allocated to the telecommunications sector in fiscal as net income for fiscal year contained a one time gain of approximately million from the sale of versant s websphere consulting business  we believe that income from continuing operations before taxes provides a more meaningful basis for comparing the company s performance in future periods 
we currently anticipate income from continuing operations before taxes of between million and million for fiscal year  representing growth of to when compared to income from continuing operations before taxes of million in fiscal year we expect our sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses in fiscal to be substantially consistent compared to fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of our assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base these estimates and judgments on information reasonably available to us  such as our historical experience and trends and industry  economic and seasonal fluctuations  and on our own internal projections that we derive from that information 
although we believe our estimates to be reasonable under the circumstances  there can be no assurances that such estimates will be accurate given that the application of these accounting policies necessarily involves the exercise of subjective judgment and the making of assumptions regarding future uncertainties 
we consider critical those accounting policies that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and that are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  goodwill and acquired intangible assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation  restructuring charges  and income taxes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  and sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenues consist mainly of revenues earned under software license agreements  maintenance support agreements otherwise known as post contract customer support or pcs  and agreements for consulting and training activities 
we use the residual method to recognize revenues when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date 
if there is an undelivered element under the license arrangement  we defer revenues based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of the fair value of the undelivered element  as determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements of a transaction  we defer all revenues from that transaction until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
under the residual method  discounts are allocated only to the delivered elements in a multiple element arrangement  with any undelivered elements being deferred based on the vendor specific objective evidence of the value of such undelivered elements 
we typically do not offer discounts on future undeveloped products 
revenues from software license arrangements  including prepaid license fees  are recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
delivery has occurred and there are no future deliverables except post contract support pcs 
the fee is fixed and determinable 
if we cannot conclude that a fee is fixed and determinable  then assuming all other criteria have been met  we recognize the revenues  as payments become due in accordance with paragraph of sop collection is probable 
probability of collection is assessed using the following customer information credit service reports  bank and trade references  public filings  and or current financial statements 
prior payment experience is reviewed on all existing customers 
payment terms in excess of our standard payment terms of days net are granted only on an exception basis  typically in situations where customers elect to purchase development and deployment licenses simultaneously for an entire project and are attempting to align their payments with their deployment schedules 
extended payment terms are only granted to customers with a proven ability to pay at the time the order is received  and with prior approval of our senior management 
in accordance with paragraph of sop  we have an established history of collection  without concessions  on longer term receivables with such customers 
we typically do not grant extended payment terms beyond days 
if an acceptance period or other contingency exists  revenues are not recognized until customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period  or satisfaction of the contingency  as applicable 
our license fees are non cancelable and non refundable  and we do not make concessions or grant refunds for any unused amount 
also  our customer agreements for prepaid deployment licenses do not make payment of our license fees contingent upon the actual deployment of the software 
therefore  a customer s delay or acceleration in its deployment schedule does not impact our revenue recognition 
revenues from related pcs for all product lines are usually billed in advance of the service being provided and are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term in which the pcs is to be performed  which is generally twelve months 
in some cases pcs revenues are paid in arrears of the service being provided and are recognized as revenues at the time the customer provides a report to us for deployments made during a given time period 
training and consulting revenues are recognized when a purchase order is received  the services have been performed and collection is deemed probable 
consulting services are billed on an hourly  daily or monthly rate 
training classes are billed based on group or individual attendance 
we categorize our customers into two broad groups  end users and value added resellers vars 
end user customers are companies who use our products internally and do not redistribute the product outside of their corporate organizations 
var customers include traditional value added resellers  systems integrators  oems and other vendors who redistribute our products to their external third party customers  either individually or as part of an integrated product 
we license our data management products through two types of perpetual licenses development and test licenses and deployment licenses 
development and test licenses are typically sold on a per seat basis and authorize a customer to develop and test an application program that uses our software product 
prior to an end user customer being able to deploy an application that it has developed under our development license  it must purchase deployment licenses based on the number of computers connected to the server that will run the application using our database management system 
for certain applications  we offer deployment licenses priced on a per user basis 
pricing of versant object database and fastobjects licenses varies according to several factors  including the number of computer servers on which the application runs and the number of users that are able to access the server at any one time 
customers may elect to simultaneously purchase development and deployment licenses for an entire project 
these development and deployment licenses may also provide for prepayment of a nonrefundable amount for future deployment 
vars and distributors purchase development licenses from us on a per seat basis on terms similar to those of development licenses sold directly to end users 
vars are authorized to sublicense deployment copies of our data management products that are either bundled or embedded in the var s applications and sold directly to end users 
vars are required to report their distribution of our software and are charged a royalty that is based either on the number of copies of our application software that are distributed or computed as a percentage of the selling price charged by the vars to their end user customers 
these royalties from vars may be prepaid in full or paid upon deployment 
provided that all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met  revenues from arrangements with vars are recognized  i as to prepaid license arrangements  when the prepaid licenses are sold to the vars  and ii as to other license arrangements  at the time the var provides a royalty report to us for sales made by the var during a given period 
revenues from the resale of third party products or services are recorded at total contract value with the corresponding cost included in the cost of sales when we act as a principal in these transactions by assuming the risks and rewards of ownership including the risk of loss for collection  delivery or returns 
when we do not assume the risks and rewards of ownership  revenues from the resale of third party products or services are recorded at contract value net of the cost of sales 
in some instances that a customer requests engineering work for porting our products to an unsupported platform or customization of our software for specific functionality  or any other non routine technical assignment  we recognize revenues in accordance with sop accounting research bulletin arb no 
as amended  long term construction type contractsand use either time and material percentage of completion or completed contract methods for recognizing revenues 
we use the percentage of completion method if we can make reasonable and dependable estimates of labor costs and hours required to complete the work in question 
we periodically review these estimates in connection with work performed and rates actually charged and recognize any losses when identified 
progress to completion is determined using the cost to cost method  whereby cost incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated cost determines the percentage completed and revenue recognized 
when using the percentage of completion method  the following conditions must exist an agreement must include provisions that clearly specify the rights regarding goods or services to be provided and received by both parties  the consideration to be exchanged and the manner and terms of settlement 
the customer is able to satisfy their obligations under the contract 
versant is able to satisfy its obligations under the contract 
the completed contract method is used when reasonable or dependable estimates cannot be made 
as a result  in such situations  we defer all revenues until such time that the work is fully completed 
management makes significant judgments and estimates in connection with the determination of the revenue recognized in each accounting period 
if we had made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period  material differences in the amount and timing of revenue recognized would have resulted 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets we account for purchases of acquired companies in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations and account for the related acquired intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas  we allocate the cost of the acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired according to their respective fair values as of the date of completion of the acquisition  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets  such as acquired technology  are amortized to expense over time  while in process research and development costs  or ipr d  if any  are charged to operations expenditures at the time of acquisition 
we test for any goodwill impairment within our single data management operating segment 
all our goodwill has been aggregated from  and acquired in connection with  the following acquisitions versant europe  acquired in  poet holdings  inc  acquired in march  technology of jdo genie pty ltd  acquired in june  and fastobjects  inc  acquired in july we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas  which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level  at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  as provided in sfas we use the market approach to assess the fair value of our assets and this value is compared with the carrying value of those assets to test for impairment 
the total fair value of our assets is estimated by summing the fair value of our equity less our liabilities 
under this approach  if the estimated fair value of our assets is greater than the carrying value of these assets  then there is no goodwill impairment 
if the estimated fair value of our assets is less than the carrying value of these assets  then we allocate the reporting unit s estimated fair value to its assets and liabilities as though the reporting unit had just been acquired in a business combination 
the impairment loss is the amount  if any  by which the implied fair value of goodwill allocable to the reporting unit is less than that reporting unit s goodwill carrying amount and would be recorded in operating results during the period of such impairment 
as required by sfas  we ceased amortizing goodwill effective november  prior to november   we amortized goodwill over five years using the straight line method 
identifiable intangibles are currently amortized over five years in relation to the jdo genie pty ltd acquisition  six years in relation to the fastobjects  inc acquisition  and seven years in relation to our acquisition of poet  using the straight line method in each of these cases 
in september  we performed an evaluation of our goodwill and intangible assets based on the requirements of sfas and sfas as a result of this impairment test and valuation analysis  we determined that the value of our goodwill and intangible assets had been fairly recorded in our financial statements  and therefore  no impairment charges against our goodwill and intangible assets related to our poet and fastobjects acquisitions were recorded in fiscal allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding accounts receivable and provide an allowance for a portion of our accounts receivable if collection becomes doubtful 
we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of our customers  based on ongoing credit evaluations and the aging profile of customers accounts receivable  as well as the current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
historically  our allowance for doubtful accounts has been sufficient to cover our actual credit losses 
however  since we cannot predict changes in the financial stability of our customers  we cannot guarantee that our allowance will continue to be sufficient 
if actual credit losses exceed the allowance that we have established  it would increase our operating expenses and reduce our reported net income 
we evaluate and revise our bad debt allowance as part of our quarter end process at each subsidiary and corporate level 
our management assigns a risk factor and percentage of risk to each account receivable  the collection of which is considered non routine 
our allowance for doubtful accounts amounted to  or of gross accounts receivable  at october   and  or of gross accounts receivable  at october  the reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts at october  as compared to october   resulted from a continued favorable collection history that we experienced during the past fiscal year 
stock based compensation expense in december  fasb revised sfas no 
and issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar awards 
in march  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab 
sab creates a framework that is premised on two overarching themes a considerable judgment will be required to successfully implement sfas r  specifically when valuing employee stock options  and b reasonable individuals  acting in good faith  may conclude differently on the fair value of employee stock options 
we have applied the principles of sab in conjunction with our adoption of sfas r in fiscal we have exercised significant judgment and estimates to determine the variables used in calculation of stock based compensation 
we chose the closed form model of black scholes option pricing model to arrive at stock option expense valuation 
the black scholes option pricing model assumes that option exercises occur at the end of an option s expected life  and that expected volatility  expected dividends  and risk free interest rates are constant over the option s term 
the expected life of an employee stock option is the period of time that it is expected to be outstanding 
we use a historical model to arrive at the expected life of our options  but we also take into consideration other factors that could possibly impact the future expected life of the options 
we determined that the estimated expected life of the options granted under our equity incentive plan as of october  was years 
we believe that none of the variables  such as the vesting period  expected volatility  blackout periods and employee demographics have materially changed 
therefore  we have concluded that the historical expected life represents fairly the expected future life of the options at this time 
the expected life for the options granted to the board members under our directors stock option plan  or directors plan  who are not full time employees of versant  was years as of october  versant used the simplified method allowed by sab to arrive at this calculation 
under the simplified method  the expected term is equal to vesting term plus original contractual term divided by two 
we have further estimated that the expected life of rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  is six months  which is the duration of each purchase period in our plan 
volatility is a measure of the amount by which a financial variable  such as share price  has fluctuated historical volatility or is expected to fluctuate expected volatility during the expected life of the options 
the black scholes option pricing model does not incorporate a range of expected volatilities over the option s expected life 
we use the historical volatility over the expected term of the options to estimate the expected volatility 
we calculate the standard deviation of price changes for the periods of four years  three years  two years  one and half years  one year and half a year 
then  we calculate historical volatility for the past four  three  two  one and half  one  and half year periods 
we  however  take into account other current information available to determine that the expected volatility  derived based on historical volatility  represents fairly the future volatility of our common stock 
at this time  we do not believe that there is any indication that future volatility will differ from historical volatility 
we have estimated that our volatility is as of october  we use the us treasury strip rates listed on the last thursday of every month on the wall street journal to compute risk free interest rate 
we have not distributed any dividends to our common shareholders and do not expect to do so in the near future 
we estimate forfeiture rates at the time of grant and revise it in subsequent periods if actual forfeiture rates differ from those estimates 
we apply the forfeiture rate to the unvested portion of the option valuation and perform a true up for the amount of the valuation to be recorded if the actual forfeiture rate is different from the one applied in prior periods 
the current forfeiture rate for the unvested portion of the option valuation recognized for the fourth quarter of fiscal is at for grants under the equity incentive plan and for grants under the director plan 
since our current stock price has been trading in a stable range  we assumed that all the participants in our espp would hold onto their contributions to acquire their shares at the end of the period 
therefore  we have not provided any forfeiture provision for our espp for the six month purchase period commencing june  for further details  please see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
restructuring we have streamlined and restructured our operations from time to time in the past 
our restructuring expenses and accruals require significant estimates by management using the best information available at the time 
these estimates include facility exit costs  such as demise and lease termination costs  timing of future sublease occupancy  sublease income based on expected future market conditions  and other fees associated with our restructuring expenses  such as brokerage fees 
we evaluate a number of factors to determine the appropriateness and reasonableness of our restructuring accruals on a regular basis 
such factors include  but are not limited to  available market data  information from third party real estate brokers  and ongoing negotiations in order to estimate the likelihood  timing  lease terms and rates to be realized from potential subleases of restructured facilities held under operating leases 
in addition  our restructuring estimates for facilities could be materially and adversely impacted by the financial condition of sub lessees and changes in their ability to meet their financial obligations throughout the term of any sublease agreement 
the impact of these estimated costs and sublease proceeds are significant factors in determining the appropriateness of our restructuring accrual balance presented in our consolidated balance sheet at october  our actual expenses may differ significantly from our estimates and as such  may require adjustments to our restructuring accruals  which will impact our operating results in future periods 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we committed to and began implementing a restructuring program to realign our resources  substantially reduce our ongoing operating expenses and refocus our business on our versant object database product 
as a result  we recorded total restructuring charges of   of which was related to severance costs for the fiscal year ended october  versant also recorded total restructuring charges of approximately  and  for the three months ended january  and april   respectively 
with the completion of the sale of the assets associated with our websphere consulting practice  in the second quarter of fiscal we had effectively completed the restructuring plan we initiated in june the total quarterly cost savings attributable to this restructuring plan  excluding the effect of the voa 
net spin off  was approximately  for the quarter ended october   and was increased to approximately  for the quarter ended july  and beyond 
these cost savings are related to completed headcount reduction as well as reduced discretionary spending 
income taxes we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and account for income taxes payable as part of the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation and amortization  for financial and tax reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet to the extent deemed realizable 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and the extent we believe that recovery is not likely 
we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets to the extent such assets are not deemed to be realizable 
if we establish a valuation allowance or increase it in a given period  then we must increase the tax provision in our statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  we have established full valuation allowances at october  and october  for our deferred tax assets 
results of operations the acquisitions of poet  the jdo genie assets and fastobjects  inc became effective on march   june  and july   respectively 
therefore  our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal incorporated the results from the effective dates of these respective acquisitions 
the following table sets forth the historical results of operations for versant for our three fiscal years ended october   and  expressed as a percentage of total revenues 
percentage of revenues fiscal year ended october  revenues license maintenance professional services total revenues cost of revenues license amortization of intangible assets maintenance professional services total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of goodwill impairment of goodwill impairment of intangibles restructuring total operating expenses income loss from operations outside shareholders income from vie other income  net gain on disposal of variable interest entity income loss from continuing operations before taxes provision for income taxes net income loss from continuing operations deemed dividend to preferred shareholders net income loss from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders net income loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes gain loss from sale of discontinued operations  net of income taxes net income loss revenues total revenues the following table summarizes total revenues in thousands  except percentages for fiscal  and fiscal vs fiscal vs fiscal year ended october  increase decrease increase decrease in dollars percentage in dollars percentage total revenues total revenues are comprised of license fees  maintenance  training  consulting  technical and other support services 
fluctuations in our total revenues can be attributed to changes in product and customer mix  general trends in information technology spending  changes in geographic mix  and the corresponding impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 
further  product life cycles impact revenues periodically as old contracts expire and new products are released 
our total revenues increased  or in fiscal compared to fiscal  and our total revenues decreased  or in fiscal compared to fiscal the inherently unpredictable business cycle of an enterprise software company  together with the cautious consumer behavior in the macro economic environment  make discernment of continued and meaningful business trends more difficult 
in terms of license revenues  we are still experiencing extremely cautious behaviors in it purchasing in north america lengthy sales cycles and customers preference for licensing our software on an as needed basis  versus the historical practice of prepaying license fees in advance of usage  are factors adversely affecting our license revenues 
this trend is more apparent in the telecommunications and technology industries 
we  however  expect higher license and maintenance revenues and lower consulting revenues for fiscal  resulting in comparable total revenues to fiscal the projected decrease in consulting revenues is primarily due to a significant european consulting arrangement in fiscal not expected to repeat in fiscal we anticipate higher license and maintenance revenues in fiscal  as we have a higher level of dedicated resources and sales personnel allocated to the telecommunications sector in fiscal revenues by category the following table summarizes our revenues by category in thousands  except percentages in fiscal  and fiscal vs fiscal vs fiscal year ended october  increase decrease increase decrease in dollars percentage in dollars percentage total revenues by category license revenues maintenance revenues professional services revenues total percentage of revenues by category license revenues maintenance revenues professional services revenues total fiscal compared to fiscal license revenues license revenues represent perpetual license fees received and recognized from our end users and value added resellers 
license revenues were million or of total revenues in fiscal  a decline of  or from million or of total revenues reported in fiscal in the european region  there was a  decrease in license revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to a significant follow on order from a european telecommunications company during the three months ended january  not repeated in fiscal this decline was partially offset by a  increase in license revenues from our north american region  largely as a result of a significant license transaction closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal maintenance revenues maintenance and technical support revenues include revenues derived from maintenance agreements  under which we provide customers with internet and telephone access to support personnel and software upgrades  dedicated technical assistance and emergency response support options 
maintenance revenues were million or of total revenues in fiscal  an increase of  or from million or of total revenues reported in fiscal european maintenance revenues increased  in fiscal  primarily as a result of three larger maintenance contracts  an increase in extended support agreements ie  for customers using older versant software not supported through standard support agreements that have a higher selling price  and to a lesser extent  back maintenance revenues 
additionally  there was an increase of  in maintenance revenues from our north american operations  primarily as a result of an increase in extended support agreements 
professional services revenues professional services revenues consist of revenues from consulting  training and technical support as well as billable travel expenses incurred by our professional services organization 
professional services revenues were million or of total revenues in fiscal  an increase of  or from  or of total revenues reported in fiscal this increase was mainly due to two significant percentage of completion consulting arrangements with two european customers during fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal license revenues license revenues declined  or in fiscal compared to fiscal this decline was largely attributable to a million decline in license revenues in our north american region as a result of adverse market conditions and softness of demand for our versant object database line of business 
further  due to our restructuring  we had organizational changes in our sales department and new management team that was not fully established until the fourth quarter of fiscal  which resulted in delays in closure and  in some cases  failure to close certain license contracts 
the decline was partially offset by a million increase in license revenues from our european region as a result of a significant follow through order from a european telecommunications company during the first quarter of fiscal  overall strong demand for our products in europe  and the presence of an established sales force in our european region 
maintenance revenues our maintenance revenues decreased approximately  or in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a decline of million in maintenance revenues in our north american region as a result of termination of a few major maintenance agreements for approximately  towards the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the impact of the elimination of product lines of approximately  the decrease was partially offset by an increase of  in maintenance revenues from our european region due to increased license revenues  the addition of poet s maintenance and support contracts  and the impact of a favorable foreign currency exchange gain of  growth in maintenance revenues is highly dependent on our ability to generate additional license revenues as well as retaining our customer base 
professional services revenues our professional services revenues decreased approximately  or in fiscal compared to fiscal the decline was primarily due to an overall decline of the backlog of our new professional services contracts in our north american region due to economic conditions

these declines were offset by an increase of approximately  in salary and traveling expenses in our european operations attributable to our ceo as a result of a reorganization in management

vanatec s results were included in our consolidated financial statements for the three month periods ended july   october  and january  and through march  during the three months ended january   we absorbed our share of vanatec s losses up to the point that it exceeded variable interest liability  and subsequent to that we absorbed of the losses that vanatec had incurred for an additional amount of  for the three months ended january  on march   we sold our interest in vanatec to a third party investor for  and entered into a joint ownership agreement with vanatec with respect to certain technology we had previously licensed to vanatec 
according to this agreement  vanatec is obligated to pay versant a running royalty interest at a rate of six percent of its net proceeds  but no less than per copy of licenses it grants of the co owned technology  for a period of five years following the effective date of this agreement 
further  at any time during the royalty period  vanatec has the right to exercise a buyout for its royalty obligations by making a one time payment to versant of  as a result of versant s sale of its interest in vanatec and this agreement  versant determined that it was no longer the primary beneficiary of vanatec  and thus  was no longer required to consolidate vanatec s operating results

the provision for income taxes in germany of approximately  for fiscal is attributable to the taxable income related to our german operations that is in excess of the allowable utilization of the tax loss carry forwards  and therefore  subject to corporate taxes 
furthermore  we fully utilized our tax loss carry forwards in the uk during fiscal the uk provision for income taxes of  reflects the net taxable income subject to uk taxes after utilization of the available tax loss carry forward 
we incurred foreign withholding tax and state franchise tax of approximately   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  which we have included in our income tax provision 
at october   we had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of million and million  respectively  and federal and state tax credit carry forwards of million and million  respectively 
the federal tax credit carry forwards expire on various dates through  if not utilized 
the state tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
additionally  at october   we had german net operating tax loss carry forwards of approximately million 
the german net operating tax loss carry forwards can be carried forward indefinitely 
due to our history of operating losses  we believe that there is sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability of these carry forwards and  therefore  a valuation allowance of approximately million has been recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we will continue to assess the realizability of the tax benefit available based on actual and forecasted operating results 
due to change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of  the availability of net operating loss and tax carry forwards to offset federal taxable income in future periods is subject to an annual limitation 
a portion of deferred tax assets relating to net operating losses  pertains to net operating loss carry forwards resulting from tax deductions upon the exercise of employee stock options of approximately million 
when recognized  the tax benefit of these loss carry forwards will be accounted for as a credit to additional paid in capital rather than a reduction of income tax expense 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes in february  we sold our websphere consulting business in exchange for a one time cash payment plus certain contingent payments during a month period following the close of the transaction 
additionally  in september  we sold all the stock of poet gmbh  an indirect versant subsidiary that owned the assets and employed the personnel of our catalog solutions business the catalog business to a privately held german company 
as a result  we have reflected the results of operations of the websphere consulting practice for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal and the results of operations of the catalog business for fiscal as discontinued operations 
therefore  reported revenues for these periods no longer include any revenues from the websphere consulting practice and the catalog business 
the results from the discontinued websphere and catalog business operations  however  are reported as income loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes

the following table summarizes our cash balances held in foreign currencies and their equivalent us dollar amounts in thousands as of october  local currency us dollar cash in foreign currency euro british pound india rupee rs 
 total we transact business in various foreign currencies and  accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
to date  the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our net operating results has not been significant 
operating expenses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries are denominated primarily in local currencies 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge these operating expenses 
we intend to assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis during fiscal our exposure to foreign exchange risk is related to the magnitude of foreign net profits and losses denominated in euros and pound sterling  as well as our net position of monetary assets and monetary liabilities in those foreign currencies 
these exposures have the potential to produce either gains or losses within our consolidated results 
our european operations  however  in some instances act as a natural hedge since both operating expenses as well as revenues are denominated in local currencies 
in these instances  although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of euros or pound sterling against the us dollar will result in lower revenues when translated into us dollars  the operating expenditures will be lower as well 
additionally  since most of our cash resides outside the united states  we have maintained approximately of our cash balance in europe in the form of us dollars to neutralize the impact of any foreign currency fluctuations 
in relation to our cash balances held overseas  there were no european union foreign exchange restrictions on repatriating our overseas held cash to the united states 
however  we may be subject to income tax withholding in the source countries and to us federal and state income taxes if the cash payment or transfer from our subsidiaries to the us parent were to be classified as a dividend 
other payments made by our european overseas subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business eg payment of royalties or interest from the subsidiaries to the us parent were generally not subject to income tax withholding due to tax treaties 
our cash equivalents primarily consist of money market accounts  accordingly  our interest rate risk is not considered significant

the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable and collections from our customers for accounts receivable will impact our cash flows from operating activities 
we typically pay our vendors and service providers in accordance with their invoice terms and conditions 
our standard payment terms for our invoices are usually between and days net 
we measure the effectiveness of our collection efforts by an analysis of our accounts receivable and our days sales outstanding  or dso 
we calculate dso by taking the ending accounts receivable balances net of bad debt allowance divided by the average daily sales amount 
average daily sales amount is calculated by dividing the total quarterly revenue recognized net of changes in deferred revenues divided by days 
collection of accounts receivable and related dso could fluctuate in the future periods  due to timing and amount of our revenues and the effectiveness of our collection efforts

principal payments of  under capital lease obligations 
our future liquidity and capital resources could be impacted by the exercise of outstanding common stock options and the cash proceeds we receive upon exercise of these securities 
further  as of october  we had approximately  shares available to issue under our current equity incentive and director plans 
the timing of the issuance  the duration of their vesting provision and the grant price will all impact the timing of any proceeds 
accordingly  we cannot estimate the amount of such proceeds at this time 
fiscal our main source of cash from financing activities was proceeds from sale of common stock under our employee stock option and stock purchase plans and  in the periods that we had a receivable line of credit in place  periodic draw downs on the credit line that were typically repaid within a month 
in fiscal   cash provided by financing activities  comprised of the following cash inflows of  due to proceeds from the sale of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans  and cash inflows of  due to proceeds from the borrowing from the line of credit during the fourth quarter of fiscal on june   versant and a bank entered into a loan and security agreement  a streamline facility agreement and an intellectual property security agreement  collectively  the loan agreements 
under the terms of these loan agreements  we may borrow up to a maximum of million from the bank atany one time under a revolving secured accounts receivable based line of credit 
this line of credit permits versant to obtain short term loan advances from the bank equal to of the face amount of specific eligible accounts receivable of versant 
the interest rate on each advance will be either or above the bank s prime rate 
as noted below  this credit facility expires in june and we do not currently expect to renew it 
fiscal on september   our receivables based credit line for million with a financial institution expired and we elected not to renew the facility at that time due to our very low historic usage of this credit line 
the last time we borrowed under this line was in october for  and this amount was repaid within a month 
our primary uses of cash in financing activities were typically for the repayments under our receivables credit line that  as mentioned above  expired in september in fiscal  cash provided and used in financing activities were as follows repayment of the amount drawn down on the receivables credit line for  in october  offset by the proceeds for the sale of common stock for  under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
commitments and contingencies our principal commitments as of october  consisted of obligations under operating leases for facilities and equipment 
in november  we entered into a ten year operating lease agreement for our corporate headquarters in fremont  california that commenced on july  and expires on june  the terms of the lease provide for certain increases in rental payments during the lease term 
rental expense under this agreement  including contractual rent increases  is recognized on a straight line basis 
we also lease field office space in europe and india  generally under multi year operating lease agreements 
consolidated rent expense in fiscal years ended october   october  and october   were approximately  million  and million  respectively 
we have recorded approximately  of our commitments on our october  balance sheet 
our annual minimum commitments as of october  under non cancelable operating leases  not recorded on the october  balance sheet  are as follows rental equipment lease leases total fiscal year ending october  thereafter total on june   we entered into a loan and security agreement with a financial institution  a streamline facility agreement and an intellectual property security agreement  or collectively  the loan agreements 
under the terms of these loan agreements  we may borrow up to a maximum of million from the bank at any one time under a revolving secured accounts receivable based line of credit 
this line of credit permits us to obtain short term loan advances from the financial institution equal to of the face amount of our specific eligible accounts receivable 
the interest rate on each advance will be either or above the bank s prime rate 
our obligations to the financial institution under the loan agreements are secured by a first security interest in all of our assets  including our equipment  cash and intellectual property 
the credit facility provided by the loan agreements will expire by june   and we do not expect to renew this facility or enter into another credit facility in fiscal we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash to be generated from operations will be sufficient to finance our operations during the next twelve months 
however  if we fail to generate adequate cash flows from operations in the future  due to an unexpected decline in our revenues  or due to a sustained increase in cash expenditures in excess of the revenues generated  then our cash balances may not be sufficient to fund our continuing operations without obtaining additional debt or equity financing 
additional cash may also be needed to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies  and we expect that  in the event of such an acquisition or investment  if significant  it will be necessary for us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
if we are required to obtain additional financing for our working capital  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on reasonable financial or other terms  or at all 
the prices at which new investors might be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the market value or the trading price of our common stock 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could also result in dilution to our shareholders  which could be substantial and may involve the issuance of preferred securities that would have liquidation preferences that entitle holders of the preferred securities to receive certain amounts before holders of our common stock in connection with an acquisition or business combination involving versant or a liquidation of versant 
new investors may also seek agreements giving them additional voting control or seats on our board of directors 
further  if our common stock were ever delisted from trading on the nasdaq capital market  our ability to obtain financing through sales of our stock would be materially impaired 
even if we were able to obtain additional debt or equity financing  the terms of any such financing might significantly restrict our business activities and in some circumstances  might require us to obtain the approval of our shareholders  which could delay or prevent consummation of the financing transaction 
in order to be able to comply with the nasdaq capital market s continued listing requirements regarding the minimum bid price of our common stock  at our annual meeting of shareholders held on august   our shareholders approved an amendment of our articles of incorporation to effect a for reverse split of our outstanding common stock  and to reduce the number of authorized shares of our common stock  series a preferred stock and undesignated preferred stock in proportion to the ratio of the reverse split 
subsequent to the reverse split  on september   we received notice from nasdaq market that we regained compliance with nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections 
this new standard replaces apb opinion  accounting changes and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
among other changes  sfas requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented on the new accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas also provides that a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long lived non financial asset be accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively that was effected by a change in accounting principle  and that corrections of previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
the new standard is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued fsp no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
this fsp provides a practical transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards to employees  as an alternative to the transition guidance for the apic pool in paragraph of statement r 
the guidance in this fsp is effective after november  as posted in the fasb website 
the company may take up to one year from the later of adoption of sfas r or the effective date of this fsp to evaluate its available transition alternatives and make its one time election 
the company will evaluate this guidance  but does not expect a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin seeks to reduce the significant diversity in practice associated with financial statement recognition and measurement in accounting for income taxes 
in recognition that a period of six to nine months would be needed to initially apply fin  the effective date of fin is the first fiscal year beginning after december   with early adoption encouraged 
the company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of fin will have on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued statement  fair value measurements  fas 
this statement clarifies the definition of fair value  the methods used to measure fair value  and requires expanded financial statement disclosures about fair value measurements for assets and liabilities 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the new guidance will be effective for us on november  and we are currently assessing the impact on our financial statements 
in september  the sec s office of the chief accountant and divisions of corporation finance and investment management released staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides interpretive guidance on how registrants should quantify financial statement misstatements 
currently  the two methods most commonly used by preparers and auditors to quantify misstatements are the rollover method which focuses primarily on the income statement impact of misstatements and the iron curtain method which focuses primarily on the balance sheet impact of misstatements 
under sab  registrants will be required to consider both the rollover and iron curtain methods ie  a dual approach when evaluating the materiality of financial statement errors 
registrants will need to revisit their prior materiality assessments and consider them using both the rollover and iron curtain methods 
sab is effective for annual financial statements in the first fiscal year ending after november   therefore for us  the year ended october  the sab provides transition accounting and disclosure guidance for situations in which a registrant concludes that a material error s existed in prior period financial statements under the dual approach 
specifically  registrants will be permitted to restate prior period financial statements or recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying sab through an adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of adoption 
we believe sab will not have a material impact on our annual financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency hedging instruments 
we transact business in various foreign currencies and  accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
to date  the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and operating expenses has not been material 
operating expenses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries are denominated primarily in local currencies 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge these operating expenses 
we intend to assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis during fiscal our exposure to foreign exchange risk is related to the magnitude of foreign net profits and losses denominated in euros and pound sterling  as well as our net position of monetary assets and monetary liabilities in those foreign currencies 
these exposures have the potential to produce either gains or losses within our consolidated results 
our european operations  however  in some instances act as a natural hedge since both operating expenses as well as revenues are denominated in local currencies 
in these instances  although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of euros or pound sterling against the us dollar will result in lower revenues when translated into us dollars  the operating expenditures will be lower as well 
additionally  since most of our cash resides outside the united states  we have maintained approximately of our cash balance in europe in the form of us dollars to neutralize the impact of any foreign currency fluctuations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
our cash equivalents primarily consist of money market accounts  therefore  we do not believe that our interest rate risk is significant at this time
