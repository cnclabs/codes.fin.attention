item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies 
as an overriding royalty owner  actual production results are not known to us until reported by the operator  which could be a period of days later than the actual month of production 
to comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we must estimate earned but unpaid royalty from this production 
to estimate this amount  we utilize historical information based on the latest production reports from the individual leases and current average prices as reported for oil by chevron usa and the spot market price for natural gas delivered at the henry hub in louisiana for the period under report 
results of operations 
marine s revenues are derived from the oil and natural gas production activities of unrelated parties 
marine s revenues and distributions fluctuate from period to period based upon factors beyond marine s control  including without limitation the number of leases subject to marine s interests  the number of productive wells drilled on leases subject to marine s interests  the level of production over time from such wells and the prices at which the oil and natural gas from such wells are sold 
marine believes that it will continue to have revenues sufficient to permit distributions to be made to unitholders for the foreseeable future  although no assurance can be made regarding the amounts thereof 
the foregoing sentence is a forward looking statement and is subject to numerous factors 
factors that might cause actual results to differ from expected results include reductions in prices or demand for oil and natural gas  which might then lead to decreased production  reductions in 
table of contents production due to depletion of existing wells or disruptions in service  including as the result of storm damage  blowouts or other production accidents  and geological changes such as cratering of productive formations  and the expiration or release of leases subject to marine s interests 
marine s income consists primarily of oil and natural gas royalties and is based on the value at the well of its percentage interest in oil and natural gas sold without reduction for any of the expenses of production 
value at the well for oil means the purchasers posted price at its receiving point onshore  less the cost of transportation from the offshore lease to the onshore receiving point 
summary review 
marine s net income for the year ended june  amounted to  or per unit as compared to  or per unit in fiscal and  or per unit in fiscal these results also include income from marine s equity interest in tidelands which amounted to  for fiscal   for fiscal and  for fiscal income from tidelands contributed approximately of marine s royalty income for fiscal as compared to and of marine s income for fiscal and  respectively 
marine s administrative expenses increased to  in fiscal from  spent in fiscal this increase was substantially due to increased fees for professional services 
interest income increased to  in fiscal from  realized in fiscal due to a moderate increase in interest rates 
the following table shows the number of wells drilled or worked over on leases in which marine has an interest including its equity interest in tidelands and the number of producing wells for the past three fiscal years 
year ended june  drilled producing hurricanes katrina and rita are the primary cause of the decrease since in the number of producing wells on leases in which marine has an interest 
the majority of the loss of producing wells was due to hurricane katrina 
in addition  some wells have been lost due to depletion 
a significant amount of equipment and personnel that would normally be working on drilling new wells and working over old wells had to be used to restore wells and facilities damaged by the hurricanes 
the following table and related discussion and analysis shows the royalty income  the net quantities sold  and the average price received for oil and natural gas during the past three years excluding marine s equity interest in tidelands

revenue from natural gas royalties amounted to  an increase of over the  realized in fiscal the average price of a thousand cubic feet mcf of natural gas increased to and production decreased to  mcf 
production from existing wells is anticipated to continue to decrease in the future due to normal well depletion 
marine has no input with the operators regarding future drilling operations which could impact marine s future oil and natural gas production 
weather was the primary cause of the decline in oil and natural gas royalties in fiscal there were two major hurricanes in the gulf of mexico during the fiscal year ended june  some wells were lost due to the hurricanes 
other wells were off production for most of the quarter that ended december  and did not start recovering until the quarter that ended march  revenues for the first  second and third quarters of fiscal were down   and  respectively  from the revenue realized in the fourth quarter of fiscal capital resources and liquidity 
because of the nature of marine as a trust entity  there is no requirement for capital 
marine s only obligation is to distribute to unitholders the net income actually collected net of general and administrative cost 
as an administrator of oil and natural gas royalty properties  marine collects income monthly  pays expenses of administration  and disburses all net income collected to its unitholders each quarter 
because all of marine s revenues are invested in liquid funds pending distribution  marine does not experience liquidity problems 
marine s indenture and the charter and by laws of mpc expressly prohibits the operation of any kind of trade or business 
marine owns an interest in oil and natural gas properties which are depleting assets 
marine cannot acquire new or additional interests due to the prohibition against these investments 
because of these restrictions  marine does not require short term or long term capital 
these restrictions  along with other factors  allow marine to be treated as a grantor trust  thus all income and deductions of marine  for tax purposes  should 
table of contents flow through to each individual unitholder 
marine is not a taxable entity 
however  mpc is a taxable entity and pays state and federal taxes on its income  excluding the net profits interest to be distributed to marine and deducting statutory depletion 
marine does not currently have any long term contractual obligations 
marine has not participated in any off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as described elsewhere herein  marine s only function is to collect overriding royalties from leases operated by others and distribute those royalties to its unitholders after paying the cost of collection and administration 
marine s income is highly dependent on the prices realized from the sale of oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas prices have historically experienced significant volatility 
marine does not attempt to manage its commodity price risk through the use of fixed price contracts or financial derivatives 
due to the short length of time between receipts and disbursements  cash held by marine is held in a non interest bearing trust account 
oil and natural gas royalties received by mpc prior to payment of the net profits interest are held in money market accounts that invest in us treasury securities and are considered not at risk 
the retained earnings of mpc are held in either money market accounts or us treasury or agency securities to be held to maturity 
funds held in money market accounts and us treasury securities that mature in less than one year are considered not at risk
