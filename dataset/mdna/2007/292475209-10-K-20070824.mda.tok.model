the market for storage networking infrastructure solutions is concentrated among large oems  and as such  a significant portion of our revenues are generated from sales to a limited number of customers 
we believe that growth and diversification by investing in next generation storage networking infrastructure solutions are required in order to grow revenue  increase earnings  and increase shareholder value 

table of contents beginning with the second quarter of fiscal  our growth and diversification strategy within our single business segment was mainly driven through three market focused product lines host server products hsp  embedded storage products esp  and intelligent network products inp 
hsps mainly consist of our standard hbas  custom form factor mezzanine cards for blade servers  and application specific integrated circuits asics used in server applications 
esps mainly consist of our serial advanced technology attachment sata bridges and routers  fibre channel embedded switches  and single and multi protocol embedded controller products for enterprise class storage systems 
inps mainly consist of multi protocol intelligent storage platforms that can be deployed as iocs  mezzanine cards  or appliances 
these products expand the reach of fibre channel sans beyond the data center with solutions designed to take advantage of currently deployed one gb s ethernet networks  and products currently under development will incorporate gb s ethernet 
we believe the product lines will benefit from the overall visibility and access to our total customer and market base  as well as our ability to leverage our core technology platforms to create products that are tailored to meet the specific requirements of their market 
we continue to  and currently plan to invest in research and development  sales and marketing  and capital equipment in order to achieve our goal 
as of july   we had a total of employees 
business combinations on october   we acquired of the outstanding common shares of sierra logic  inc sierra logic  a privately held supplier of embedded products for storage networking equipment located in roseville  california 
the acquisition is part of our strategy to diversify our business by expanding our embedded products beyond fibre channel to other disk drive protocols 
the addition of sierra logic s serial advanced technology attachment sata products  as well as other products under development  will enable the us to provide our customers with cost effective  end to end solutions with enhanced features such as virtualization  multi protocol interoperability and tiered storage 
we accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
the aggregate purchase price was approximately million  including approximately million of cash for convertible preferred stock and common stock  approximately million in assumed vested stock options and other transaction costs of approximately million 
this aggregate purchase price does not include approximately million paid into escrow and deemed to be contingent consideration  which is included in other assets  approximately million in restricted stock  and approximately million of assumed unvested stock options that will be recognized as compensation expense post acquisition 
the contingent consideration relates to certain standard representations and warranties defined in the escrow agreement and is expected to be resolved within months from the acquisition date 
this allocation is subject to revision as the estimates of fair value of inventory  identifiable intangible assets  and deferred taxes are based on preliminary information and the final pre acquisition tax returns are not yet complete 
emulex is in the process of obtaining third party valuations of certain assets 
thus  the allocation of the purchase price is subject to refinement 
on may   we acquired of aarohi communications  inc aarohi  a supplier of intelligent data center networking products with principal product development facilities located in san jose  california and bangalore  india 
we accounted for the acquisition of aarohi under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 and recorded approximately million of purchased in process research and development ipr d expense during fiscal the fair value of the net assets received by us in the aarohi acquisition exceeded the purchase price to be allocated 
consequently  contingent consideration of approximately million was recognized and was included in accrued liabilities during fiscal certain performance targets were not achieved and thus  the contingent consideration of approximately million previously recorded was reversed in fiscal the final purchase price revisions were also recorded in fiscal which resulted in changes to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as a reduction to ipr d expense in the statement of income of approximately million 
we have finalized the purchase price allocation to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at estimated fair values as of the end of fiscal 
table of contents on november   we completed the cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of vixel corporation vixel 
on november   we completed our acquisition of vixel 
we acquired vixel  a leading supplier of embedded switch asics and subsystems for the storage networking market  to expand our fibre channel product line and paid approximately million in cash for all outstanding common stock  preferred stock  and warrants of vixel 
we also incurred acquisition related expenses of approximately million in cash 
in addition  we assumed vixel s stock options outstanding by issuing approximately million of our stock options with a fair value of approximately million and kept the original vesting periods for a total acquisition value of million 
we calculated the fair value of the approximately million stock options issued at the date of acquisition using the black scholes merton options pricing model 
since the completion of the acquisitions  the operations of sierra logic  aarohi  and vixel  have been integrated into our operations and are included within our one operating segment  networking products 
convertible subordinated notes offering in fiscal  we completed an approximately million private placement of contingently convertible subordinated notes due notes 
interest was payable in cash on june th and december th of each year beginning june  under the terms of the offering  the notes could be convertible into shares of emulex common stock at a price of per share at the option of the holder upon the occurrence of certain events 
the notes provided for a scheduled maturity date years following issuance and were not callable for the first five years 
holders of the notes had rights to require us to purchase the notes for cash by giving written notice within the business days prior to each of december   december   december   or december  or upon a change in control 
on november   we announced the commencement of the put option period for holders of our notes to surrender the notes for purchase 
each holder of the notes had the right to require us to purchase all or any part of such holder s notes at a price equal to  per  of principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest  including additional interest  if any  to  but excluding  the date of purchase 
at the end of the put option period on december   all such notes were surrendered and we paid approximately million to retire these notes 
no gain or loss occurred as a result of the retirement of these notes 
thus  as of july   there were no notes outstanding 

table of contents results of operations for emulex corporation and subsidiaries the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data set forth in item selected consolidated financial data  and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

these products expand the reach of fibre channel sans beyond the data center with solutions designed to take advantage of currently deployed one gb s ethernet networks  and products currently under development will incorporate gb s ethernet 
our other category mainly consists of legacy and other products 
net revenues by major customers in addition to direct sales  some of our larger oem customers purchased or marketed products indirectly through distributors  resellers or other third parties 
if these indirect sales are purchases of customer specific models  we are able to track these sales 
however  if these indirect sales are purchases of our standard models  we are not able to distinguish them by oem customer 
customers whose direct net revenues  or total direct and indirect net revenues including customer specific models purchased or marketed indirectly through distributors  resellers and other third parties  exceeded of our net revenues were as follows total direct and indirect direct revenues revenues net revenue percentage emc hewlett packard ibm info x 
table of contents amounts less than are not presented 
customer specific models purchased or marketed indirectly through distributors  resellers  and other third parties are included with the oem s revenues in these columns rather than as revenue for the distributors  resellers or other third parties 
direct sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately and of total net revenues for fiscal years and  respectively  and we expect to be similarly concentrated in the future 
our net revenues from our customers can be significantly impacted by changes to our customers business and their business models 
net revenues by sales channel from a sales channel perspective  net revenues generated from oem customers were approximately of net revenues and sales through distribution were approximately in fiscal compared to net revenues from oem customers of approximately and sales through distribution of approximately in fiscal the increase in oem net revenues was mainly due to the increase in esp net revenues 
net revenues by sales channel were as follows percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease change dollars in thousands oem distribution other total net revenues we believe that our net revenues are being generated primarily as a result of product certifications and qualifications with our oem customers  which take products directly and indirectly through distribution and contract manufacturers 
we view product certifications and qualifications as an important indicator of future revenue opportunities and growth for the company 
however  product certifications and qualifications do not necessarily ensure continued market acceptance of our products by our oem customers 
it is also very difficult to determine the future impact  if any  of product certifications and qualifications on our revenues 
net revenues by geographic territory in fiscal  domestic net revenues decreased slightly by approximately million  or  and international net revenues increased by approximately million  or  compared to fiscal our net domestic and international revenues based on billed to location were as follows percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease change dollars in thousands united states pacific rim europe and rest of the world total net revenues we believe the net increase in net revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly a function of the overall size of the market for storage networking products 
the slight decline in net revenues domestically and the increase in the pacific rim and europe and rest of the world net revenues were mainly due to a change in the bill to location for one of our key embedded customers in the prior year which has a full year effect in the current year combined with the significant increase in our esp net revenues which are mainly derived internationally in the current fiscal year 
however  as we sell to oems and distributors who 
table of contents ultimately resell our products to their customers  the geographic mix of our net revenues may not be reflective of the geographic mix of end user demand or installations 
gross profit 
cost of sales includes the cost of production of finished products  amortization expense related to core technology and developed technology intangible assets as well as support costs and other expenses related to inventory management  manufacturing quality  and order fulfillment 
approximately million and million of amortization of technology intangible assets were included in cost of sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
approximately million and million of share based compensation expense were included in cost of sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
approximately million related to the mark up to fair value on inventory acquired in the sierra logic acquisition and subsequently sold  as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  were included in cost of sales in fiscal gross margin decreased slightly to approximately in fiscal compared to approximately in fiscal due to the items above 
we anticipate gross margin will trend down over time as lower gross margin but higher volume products such as mezzanine cards for blade servers and embedded storage products become a bigger portion of our business 
engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in the design  development  and technical support of our products 
these expenses included third party fees paid to consultants  prototype development expenses  and computer service costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process 
engineering and development expenses increased approximately million  or  to approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal this represents approximately and of net revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
approximately million and million of share based compensation expense were included in engineering and development costs in fiscal years and  respectively 
we continue our growth and diversification strategies by investing significantly in new product development within the context of our three highly synergistic and focused product lines 
engineering and development headcount increased to at the end of fiscal compared to at the end of fiscal this expanded headcount resulted in an increase of approximately million in salary and related expenses 
we also invested approximately million in new product development in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal we will continue to invest in engineering and development activities and anticipate gross dollar expenditures will continue to grow in this area 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consisted primarily of salaries  commissions  and related expenses for personnel engaged in the marketing and sales of our products  as well as trade shows  product literature  promotional support costs  and other advertising related costs 
selling and marketing expenses increased approximately million  or  to approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal this represents approximately and of net revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
approximately million and million of share based compensation expense were included in selling and marketing costs in fiscal and  respectively 
as we have expanded our worldwide distribution efforts in connection with our growth initiatives  selling and marketing headcount increased to at the end of fiscal compared to at the end of fiscal this resulted in an increase of approximately million in salary and related expenses 
the remaining incremental increase in selling and marketing expenses during fiscal was mainly related to travel  advertising  and trade shows expense in order to strengthen existing and develop emerging oem relationships and leveraging worldwide distribution channels to complement our core oem relationships 
we will continue to target advertising  market promotions  and heighten brand awareness of our new and existing products in an effort to provide overall revenue growth and thus  the expectation that future selling and marketing expenditures will grow in absolute dollars 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for executives  financial accounting support  human resources  administrative services  professional fees  and other corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or  to approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal this represents approximately and of net revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
approximately million and million of share based compensation expense were included 
table of contents in general and administrative costs in fiscal and  respectively 
general and administrative headcount increased to at the end of fiscal compared to at the end of fiscal this resulted in an increase of approximately million in salary and related expenses 
the remaining incremental increase in general and administrative expenses during fiscal was mainly related to headcount hiring costs  rent and related costs  and maintenance 
amortization of other intangible assets 
amortization of other intangible assets includes the amortization of intangible assets such as patents  customer relationships  trade names  and covenants not to compete with estimable lives 
in fiscal  amortization of other intangible assets related to the october acquisition of sierra logic  the may acquisition of aarohi  and the november acquisition of vixel corporation vixel 
amortization of other intangible assets increased approximately million  or  to approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal this represents approximately of net revenues for both fiscal and fiscal the increase was due primarily to additional amortization expense from the sierra logic and aarohi acquisitions due to having a higher average balance of amortizable intangible assets 
impairment of other intangible assets 
impairment of other intangible assets represents impairment charges recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

during fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million related to the customer relationships intangible asset from the aarohi acquisition 
the initial value ascribed to this customer relationship was based primarily on forecasted revenues from mcdata corporation mcdata 
subsequent to this initial valuation  brocade communications systems  inc brocade completed its acquisition of mcdata in january following completion of the acquisition  brocade informed us of their intent to terminate certain programs that included our products 
we recorded this impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the customer relationships intangible asset to the estimated fair value of zero in fiscal in process research and development 
ipr d expense represents purchased in process research and development expense related to acquisitions 
we accounted for these acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 and recorded approximately million for purchased ipr d expense for the sierra logic acquisition during fiscal this charge was partially offset by purchase price allocation revisions of approximately million related to the aarohi acquisition 
we recorded approximately million for purchased ipr d expense for the aarohi acquisition during fiscal there may be additional future adjustments to ipr d related to the sierra logic acquisition as the purchase price allocation is being finalized 
nonoperating income  net 
nonoperating income  net  consisted primarily of interest income  interest expense  and other non operating income and expense items 
our nonoperating income  net  decreased approximately million  or  to approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million related to an investment in an early stage  privately held  company in the storage networking industry in fiscal the reduction in interest income was mainly due to lower cash and investment levels resulting from the cash paid for the aarohi and sierra logic acquisitions  the retirement of the notes  and the repurchases of our common stock 
additionally  the overall decrease in nonoperating income  net  was partially offset by lower interest expense as a result of the retirement of the notes in fiscal income taxes 
income taxes decreased approximately million  or  to approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal the effective tax increased slightly to approximately in fiscal from approximately in fiscal the change in the effective tax rate was mainly due to the nondeductible sierra logic ipr d expense of approximately million and the increase in the valuation allowance that was partially offset by the retroactive extension of the federal research tax credit during fiscal  and the resolution of tax audit contingencies in which the statute of limitations on previously open tax years expired 
the research tax credit had previously expired at the end of calendar

amortization of other intangible assets 
amortization of other intangible assets included the amortization of intangible assets such as patents  customer relationships  trade name  and covenants not to compete with estimable lives 
in fiscal year  amortization was for intangible assets related to the acquisition of aarohi that was completed during fiscal and prior acquisitions 
in fiscal year  amortization was for the acquisitions of vixel and giganet that were completed during fiscal years and  respectively 
amortization of intangibles decreased approximately million  or  to approximately million compared to approximately million in fiscal this represents approximately of net revenues in fiscal years and the decrease was mainly due to tax adjustments resulting from exercising of acquisition related non qualified stock options reducing acquisition related intangible assets as the acquisition related goodwill had been written off in fiscal impairment of goodwill 
as a result of a sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets analysis  including a second step goodwill impairment test  goodwill was written off as of june  in connection with the preparation of vixel s tax return during fiscal  we revised estimates and discovered errors related to the deferred tax assets of vixel acquired in fiscal 
these events resulted in a revision to vixel s purchase price allocation to decrease net deferred tax assets and increased goodwill  which was 
table of contents impaired in fiscal this resulted in an approximately million impairment of goodwill charge in fiscal additionally  during the preparation of the fiscal tax provision  we discovered errors related to the deferred tax liabilities of giganet acquired in fiscal 
this resulted in an approximately million reduction of the previously recorded goodwill charge of approximately million  resulting in a net goodwill impairment of approximately million for fiscal we do not believe that this approximately million impairment of goodwill is material to fiscal or to fiscal operations or financial results 
excluding this adjustment  net income for fiscal would have been approximately million 
in process research and development 
the in process research and development expense of approximately million recorded in fiscal was related to our acquisition of aarohi in may there was no in process research and development expense for fiscal nonoperating income  net 
nonoperating income  net consisted primarily of interest income  interest expense and other non operating income and expense items such as the gain on the repurchase of convertible subordinated notes 
nonoperating income  net decreased approximately million  or  to approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal the net decrease was mainly due to a net gain on the partial repurchase of our convertible notes of approximately million in fiscal  offset by higher interest income of approximately million due to higher interest rates in fiscal  and lower interest expense of approximately million in fiscal as a result of the partial repurchase of our convertible notes 
income taxes 
income taxes decreased approximately million  or  to approximately million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal the effective tax rate was approximately and of income before income taxes in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate was mainly due to the nondeductible aarohi in process research and development expenses and the increase in nondeductible share based compensation expenses in fiscal critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of net revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
if these estimates differ significantly from actual results  the impact to the financial statements may be material 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies and require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  warranty  allowance for doubtful accounts  intangibles and other long lived assets  inventories  goodwill  income taxes  and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition 
we generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment when title and risk of loss have passed  evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collectibility has been reasonably assured basic revenue recognition criteria 
we make certain sales through two tier distribution channels and have various distribution agreements with selected distributors and master value added resellers collectively  the distributors 
these distribution agreements may be terminated upon written notice by either party 
additionally  these distributors are generally given privileges to return a portion of inventory and to participate in price protection and cooperative marketing programs 
therefore  we recognize revenue on our standard products sold to our distributors based on data received from the distributors and management s estimates to approximate the point that these products have been resold by the distributors 
oem specific models sold to our distributors are governed under the related oem agreements rather than under these distribution agreements 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment for oem specific products shipped to the distributors when the basic revenue recognition criteria have been met 

table of contents additionally  we maintain accruals and allowances for price protection and various other marketing programs 
moreover  we account for these incentive programs in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
accordingly  we classify the costs of these programs based on the benefit received  if applicable  as either a reduction of revenue  a cost of sale  or an operating expense 
warranty 
we provide a warranty of between one and five years on our products 
we record a provision for estimated warranty related costs at the time of sale based on historical product return rates and management s estimates of expected future costs to fulfill our warranty obligations 
we evaluate our ongoing warranty obligation on a quarterly basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical write offs as a percentage of net revenues and management s review of outstanding accounts receivable 
amounts due from customers are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when management believes that collectibility of the amount is unlikely 
although we have not historically experienced significant losses on accounts receivable  our accounts receivable are concentrated with a small number of customers 
consequently  any write off associated with one of these customers could have a significant impact on our allowance for doubtful accounts and results of operations 
intangibles and other long lived assets 
intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of sierra logic  aarohi  and vixel are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment charges  if any 
for assets with determinable useful lives  amortization is computed using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the respective intangible assets  ranging from three months to seven years 
furthermore  periodically we assess whether our long lived assets including intangible assets  should be tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on fair value  which is determined using projected discounted future operating cash flows 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we use a standard cost system for purposes of determining cost 
the standards are adjusted periodically to represent actual cost 
we regularly compare forecasted demand and the composition of the forecast against inventory on hand and open purchase commitments in an effort to ensure the carrying value of inventory does not exceed net realizable value 
accordingly  we may have to record reductions to the carrying value of excess and obsolete inventory if forecasted demand decreases 
goodwill 
we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
management considers our business as a whole to be its reporting unit for purposes of testing for impairment 
this impairment test is performed annually during the fiscal fourth quarter 
a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  otherwise  goodwill is impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  under which we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we regularly 
table of contents review historical and anticipated future pre tax results of operations to determine whether we will be able to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is required to reduce the potential deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized due to the lack of sufficient taxable income 
as of july   we have a valuation allowance of approximately million established against capital loss carryforwards 
we establish reserves for tax contingencies that are not probable of being sustained if examined by the taxing authorities 
stock based compensation 
we account for our stock based awards to employees and non employees using the fair value method as required by financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
we used the modified prospective transition method when we adopted sfas r in the prior year which provides for only the current and future period stock based awards to be measured and recognized at fair value 
sfas no 
r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the measurement of stock based compensation cost is based on several criteria including  but not limited to  the valuation model used and associated input factors such as expected term of the award  stock price volatility  dividend rate  risk free interest rate  and award forfeiture rate 
the input factors to use in the valuation model are based on subjective future expectations combined with management judgment 
if there is a difference between the forfeiture assumptions used in determining stock based compensation costs and the actual forfeitures  which become known over time  we may change the input factors used in determining stock based compensation costs 
these changes may materially impact our results of operations in the period such changes are made 
please see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein for additional information and related disclosures 
liquidity and capital resources at july   we had approximately million in working capital and approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and current investments and approximately million of restricted cash placed in escrow which is included in other assets 
at july   we had approximately million in working capital and approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  current investments  and long term investments 
the decrease in working capital  cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  and current investments was mainly due to the completion of the sierra logic acquisition in october in the aggregate of approximately million  the extinguishment of the convertible subordinated notes in december of approximately million  and the repurchase of our common stock for an aggregate price of approximately million partially offset by cash generated from continuing operations 
we have primarily funded our cash needs from operating activities

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances  investments  and anticipated cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to support our working capital needs  capital expenditure requirements  and our growth and diversification strategy for at the least the next months 
we currently do not have any outstanding lines of credit or other borrowings 
cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was approximately million compared to fiscal of approximately million 
the net cash increase provided by operating activities was primarily a result of higher accounts payable  accrued liabilities  and other liabilities of approximately 
table of contents million  partially offset by higher accounts and other receivables of approximately million and an increase of inventories of approximately million 
investing activities used approximately million of cash during fiscal compared to cash used of approximately million during fiscal the decrease of cash used in investing activities was mainly due to timing of maturities of investments  net  of approximately million which was not reinvested  partially offset by the acquisition of sierra logic for approximately million 
in connection with this acquisition in october  we were required to pay approximately million into escrow and upon resolution of the required terms of the escrow agreement  the funds will be released from the escrow account to the former shareholders of sierra logic or used for the payment of indemnification claims  if any  under the terms of the acquisition 
cash used in financing activities during fiscal was approximately million compared to cash provided during fiscal of approximately million

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
interest rate sensitivity as of july   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities  excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents  of approximately million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity 
currently  the carrying amount of these securities approximates fair market value 
however  the fair market value of these securities is subject to interest rate risk and would decline in value if market interest rates increased 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels existing as of july   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material to our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
however  if interest rates decreased and securities within our portfolio matured and were re invested in securities with lower interest rates  interest income would decrease in the future
