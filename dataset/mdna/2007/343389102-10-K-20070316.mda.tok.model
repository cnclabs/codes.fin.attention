executive summary we are a global provider of oilfield services and equipment 
we focus on serving the drilling related needs of oil and gas companies primarily through our chemicals and logistics and our drilling products segments  and the production related needs of oil and gas companies through our artificial lift and chemicals and logistics segments 
we were incorporated in and currently trade on the american stock exchange 
our headquarters are in houston  texas 
we have expanded geographically so that we now have a growing presence in select domestic and international market areas in oklahoma  arkansas  new mexico  the gulf coast  the rocky mountains  canada  mexico  latin america  south america  europe and asia 
we market our products domestically and internationally in over countries 
several factors contributed to our financial performance in  including increased acceptance of our specialty chemicals by the major pumping pressure companies 
expansion of our rental tool and inspection services with the acquisition of can ok and the purchase of drilling mud motors 
expansion of our artificial lift segment with the acquisition of tws and liftech 
record domestic rig count levels  gas prices and oil prices 
over the past three years  we have grown both organically and through successful acquisitions of complementary or competing businesses 
we continue to actively seek profitable acquisition or merger candidates in our core businesses to either decrease costs of providing products or add new products and customer base to diversify our market 
we strive to mitigate cyclical risk in the oilfield service sector by balancing our operations between onshore versus offshore  drilling versus production  rental tools versus service  domestic versus international  and natural gas versus crude oil 
we operate as a diversified oilfield service company through our three business segments 
we believe that our product and service offerings and geographical presence through our three business segments provide us with diverse sources of cash flow 
each segment has its own technical expertise and a common commitment to provide its customers with competitively priced quality equipment and services 
the chemicals and logistics segment is made up of two business units 
the specialty chemical business unit develops  manufactures and markets specialty chemicals used by oilfield service companies in oil and gas well cementing  stimulation  drilling and production 
our research laboratories support the specific drilling and production needs of our customers 
the logistics division designs and manages automated bulk material handling  loading facilities  and blending capabilities for oilfield service companies 
the drilling products segment rents  inspects  manufactures and markets downhole drilling equipment for the energy  mining  water well and industrial drilling sectors 
the artificial lift segment manufactures and markets artificial lift equipment which includes the petrovalve line of beam pump components  electric submersible pumps  gas separators  valves and services to support coal bed methane production 

table of contents the customers for our products and services include the major integrated oil and natural gas companies  independent oil and natural gas companies  pressure pumping service companies and state owned national oil companies 
our ability to compete in the oilfield services market is dependent on our ability to differentiate our products and services  provide superior quality and service  and maintain a competitive cost structure 
activity levels in our three segments are driven primarily by current and expected commodity prices  drilling rig count  oil and gas production levels  and customer capital spending allocated for drilling and production 
critical accounting policies and estimates our critical accounting policies and procedures include but are not limited to the following cash and cash equivalents we consider all short term investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
inventories inventories consist of raw materials  finished goods and work in process 
finished goods inventories include raw materials  direct labor and production overhead 
inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market using the weighted average cost method 
the company maintains a reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventories  which is reviewed for adequacy on a periodic basis 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are stated at cost 
the cost of ordinary maintenance and repairs is charged to operations  while replacements and major improvements are capitalized 
depreciation or amortization is provided at rates considered sufficient to amortize the cost of the assets using the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives buildings and leasehold improvements years machinery  equipment and rental tools years furniture and fixtures years transportation equipment years computer equipment years we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds either the fair value or the estimated discounted cash flows of the assets  whichever is more readily measurable 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate price paid by us in acquisitions over the fair market value of the tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will be amortized over their useful lives 

table of contents financial instruments we consider the fair value of all financial instruments primarily long term debt not to be materially different from their carrying values at the end of each fiscal year based on management s estimate of our ability to borrow funds under terms and conditions similar to those of our existing debt and because the majority of our debt carries a floating rate 
we have no off balance sheet debt or other off balance sheet financing arrangements 
we have not entered into derivative or other hedging financial instruments 
revenue recognition revenue for product sales is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met i evidence of an agreement exists  ii products are shipped or services rendered to the customer and all significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  iii the price to the customer is fixed and determinable and iv the collectibility is reasonably assured 
accounts receivable are recorded at that time net of any discounts 
earnings are charged with a provision for doubtful accounts based on a current review of collectibility of the accounts receivable 
accounts receivable deemed ultimately uncollectible are applied against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
deposits and other funds received in advance of delivery are deferred until the transfer of ownership is complete 
our logistics division recognizes revenue of its design and construction oversight contracts under the percentage of completion method of accounting  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs of completion 
this percentage is applied to the total estimated revenue at completion to calculate revenue earned to date 
contract costs include all direct labor and material costs and those indirect costs related to manufacturing and construction operations 
general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
changes in job performance and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract bonus or penalty provisions and final contract settlements  may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which such revisions appear probable 
all known or anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full when such amounts become apparent 
foreign currency we have sales that are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
any foreign currency transaction gains or losses are included in our results of operations 
we have not entered into any forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the potential impact of currency fluctuations on our foreign currency denominated sales 
research and development costs expenditures for research activities relating to product development and improvement are charged to expense as incurred 
income taxes income taxes are computed under the liability method 
we provide deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of assets and liabilities 
these deferred assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to amounts which are more likely than not to be realized 

table of contents earnings per share basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
dilutive earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and dilutive effect of stock options 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and certain assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
while management believes current estimates are reasonable and appropriate  actual results could differ from these estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued its statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas no 
 fair value measurements 
fas no 
establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact that fas no 
will have on our results of operations and financial position 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab provides guidance on the consideration of effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab requires the analysis of misstatements using both a balance sheet and income statement approach and contains guidance on correcting errors under the dual approach  as well as providing transition guidance for correcting errors existing in prior years 
sab is effective for the first fiscal year ending after november  the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin is an interpretation of fasb statement no 
accounting for income taxes and was adopted by the company effective january  fin prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing  measuring  presenting and disclosing in the financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take in its tax returns 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of fin on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued fasb statement sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas no 
requires that all voluntary changes in accounting principles  including corrections of errors  are retrospectively applied to prior financial statements as if that principle had always been used  unless it is impracticable to do so 
when it is impracticable to calculate the effects on all prior periods  sfas no 
requires that the new principle be applied to the earliest period practicable 
the company adopted sfas no 
as of december  in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
this statement revises statement and supersedes apb and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires companies to expense the fair value of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  including stock options 
sfas r also provides guidance on valuing and expensing these awards  as well as disclosure requirements with respect to these equity arrangements 

table of contents we adopted sfas r effective as of january  we are following the modified prospective method of adoption of sfas r whereby earnings for prior periods will not be restated as though stock based compensation had been expensed  rather than the modified retrospective method which would entail restatement of previously published earnings 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow 
the impact of adoption of sfas r will depend on levels of share based compensation  particularly stock options  granted in the future and the fair value assigned thereto 
the adoption of sfas r has not had a material financial impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on december   the compensation committee  on behalf of the board of directors board  approved the acceleration of the vesting of all previously unvested stock options granted under our and long term incentive plans the plans 
the vesting acceleration represents options exercisable for a total of  shares of our common stock  including a total of  shares of common stock underlying options held by our executive officers 
the options have exercise prices ranging from to per share 
the closing price of our common stock on december  was 
the acceleration of the vesting schedule of the options was effected pursuant to section c x of the plans  which authorizes the board  in its sole discretion  to substitute an accelerated vesting schedule for options granted under the plans 
in most instances  stock options granted under the plans vested over a four year period 
the board imposed selling restrictions on shares received through the exercise of accelerated options 
these restrictions prohibit the sale of shares purchased under accelerated options until the date on which the options would otherwise have vested under the original option grants or six months after the date on which the options would otherwise have vested under the original option grants if the employee is no longer employed by the company

table of contents results for fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated revenue for the twelve months ended december  were million  an increase of compared to million for the year revenue increased in all of our business segments due to increased acceptance of our products  acquisitions completed in the third quarter of and in  rental revenue from the investment in additional equipment  improved pricing  and opening new operating locations 
revenue increased most significantly due to organic growth of our chemical and logistics division  followed by the acquisition of can ok in january  tws in april and liftech in june of these acquisitions accounted for million of the increase in revenue  with the remaining million coming from internal revenue growth within the chemicals and logistics segment and the drilling products segment 
international revenue made up approximately of total revenue in versus in gross profit for the year ended december  increased to million  or of revenue  compared to million  or  of revenue for the year the increase in gross profit is due to the increase in revenue in all of our business segments  with high margin tool rentals and specialty chemical sales contributing most significantly 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the acquisition of two artificial lift acquisitions which typically have lower margins than our existing businesses 
as the company matures  and with the addition of new products and services from acquisitions  margins within the segments have shifted 
organically  management s focus has been placed on expanding sales of our higher margin products and services 
this has been offset by the addition of several new products that generate lower margins but complement the existing businesses and allow the company to cross sell products and services in new markets  and spread corporate costs over a larger base of operations 
selling  general and administrative costs are not directly attributable to products sold or services rendered 
selling  general and administrative costs were million in versus million in the largest increase in expenses related to corporate activities which rose to million in compared to million in the increase was driven by a million increase in tax  accounting and audit fees associated with sarbanes oxley compliance 
in addition  we incurred million in professional fees related to due diligence efforts for a significant acquisition terminated in august the balance of the increase is primarily due to increased sales and field support costs in all three segments 
depreciation and amortization increased from million in to million in the increase is due to additional depreciable assets resulting from acquisitions and capital expenditures 
approximately million was spent in to expand our chemical manufacturing facilities and million to expand our base of rental tools including the purchase of drilling mud motors 
research and development r d costs increased from million in to million in due to the expansion of our product development department 
we plan to significantly expand our research efforts in with a budget that is triple the amount spent in as part of our research and development program in we are relocating our development laboratory to the woodlands  texas and will have a dedicated experienced sales professional for each major pressure pumping service company 
the sales representatives will work directly with our r d team to develop new products and applications for our customers 
we currently employ degreed chemists  of whom have phd s 
over the years  we have made a number of technological advances  including the development of an environmentally benign line of specialty chemicals 
substantially all of the new technologies have resulted from requests and guidance from our clients  particularly major oil companies 
research and development expenditures are charged to expense as incurred 
interest expense was million in versus million in the increase was a result of the increase in our overall debt level associated with acquisitions  coupled with higher variable interest rates 
the majority of our indebtedness carries a variable interest rate tied to the prime rate or libor 
a provision for income taxes of million was recorded in an effective tax rate of was applied in versus in  resulting in a million  or increase in the tax provision 
the 
table of contents significant increase in taxes is a result of an increase in our projected federal statutory rate based on estimated income levels  and an increase in our estimated state income tax liability 
results for fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated revenue increased by million or for the year versus as discussed in the segment analysis that follows  this increase in revenue was due to the expansion of our drilling products segment through acquisitions and continued strong performance by our chemicals and logistics segment 
we expanded our revenue both domestically and internationally  with international revenue making up approximately of consolidated revenue 
gross profit increased by million or for the year versus gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from for the year to in the gross profit is best analyzed on a segment by segment basis  discussed below  as gross profit varies between operating segments and can vary significantly from year to year 
selling  general and administrative costs increased to million for the year from million for the year  however  decreased as a percentage of revenue 
measured as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative costs dropped from for the year to in significant emphasis continues to be placed on growing revenue while controlling selling  general  and administrative costs across the organization 
general and administrative corporate expenses increased to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  these costs decreased from in to in the absolute increase is due to the continued expansion of the company and the corporate personnel required to support a growing public company 
in  the company incurred expenses and costs associated with the private placement  proxy statement  and form sb registration statement  and expenses related to the listing on the american stock exchange 
depreciation and amortization increased million or for the year compared to the same period in as a result of higher levels of property  plant and equipment associated with the drilling tool acquisitions and the expansion of our chemical laboratory and production facilities 
in addition  we incurred increased intangible asset amortization associated with acquisition costs and non compete agreements 
during the first nine months of  we depreciated our rentals tools using the straight line method with an estimated useful life of three years 
based on a review of industry practices and tax guidelines we modified the estimated useful life of rental tools from three years to seven years effective october  the change in estimated useful life was made prospectively 
research and development costs increased due to expansion of our applied research department 
we continued to expand our research staff and currently employ twelve degreed chemists  four of whom have phd s 
over the years  we have made a number of technological advances  including the development of an environmentally benign line of specialty chemicals 
substantially all of the new technologies have resulted from requests and guidance from our clients  particularly major oil companies 
research and development expenditures are charged to expense as incurred 
we intend to continue committing financial resources and effort to the development and acquisition of new products and services 
interest expense increased from million in to million in the increase was a result of the increase in our overall debt level associated with the acquisition of spidle  offset by lower interest rates on the senior credit facility obtained in february flotek s senior borrowing rates were reduced approximately basis points as a result of the new financing 
the majority of our indebtedness carries a variable interest rate tied to the prime rate 

table of contents based on our profitability  a million provision for income taxes was recorded for the year the provision was made for estimated federal and state income tax  assuming a portion of our net operating losses would be used to partially offset federal income taxes 
the effective income tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily as a result of anticipated utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards  as well as  a reduction in the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets that we now believe are more than likely than not to be utilized in the future 
results by segment chemicals and logistics for the years ended december  in thousands revenue gross profit gross profit income from operations income from operations results for fiscal compared to fiscal chemicals and logistics chemicals and logistics revenue increased million or for the year compared to the increase in revenue is a result of an increase in volume coupled with higher prices  particularly of our proprietary specialty chemicals 
the most significant revenue growth occurred in the rocky mountains  mid continent  permian basin regions and canada 
sales of our proprietary biodegradable environmentally benign green chemicals grew from million in to million in margins continue to increase as we focus on shifting more of our sales mix to higher margin patented and proprietary products 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from in to in the increase in gross profit is due to price increases and a reduction in cost of goods as a percentage of total revenue 
margins continue to increase as the sales mix shifts to higher margin patented and proprietary products 
managing chemical feedstock and transportation prices and passing cost increases on to our customers is critical to maintain our gross profits 
as of the end of  construction of a  square foot expansion to our production facilities was substantially completed 
this facility triples production capabilities and allows the division to manage larger volumes of inputs to take further advantage of volume pricing discounts 
income from operations increased from million in to million in  and the income from operations as a percentage of revenue increased from to  respectively 
results for fiscal compared to fiscal chemicals and logistics chemicals and logistics revenue increased million or  for the year compared to the increase is due to an increase in the volume of specialty chemicals sales coupled with price increases that were put into effect in mti partially offset an approximate decrease in throughput at our louisiana based bulk handling facility during as compared to  by increasing revenue associated with the design and construction oversight of bulk handling facilities in mexico and texas during cesi s focus on applied research has resulted in the penetration of new markets  continued expansion of our customer base  product portfolio and increased margins 
cesi differentiates itself through the strength of its innovative and proprietary products  the depth of the laboratory staff  dedication to product quality  and superior customer service 
fiscal compared to  international sales grew by  outpacing domestic growth 
sales into mexico  canada and russia have been the main drivers for growth in international sales 
domestic sales have continued to grow in our established core markets  the mid continent and permian basin  but have increased 
table of contents dramatically in the rocky mountains and east texas 
we continue to focus on expanding our international sales and expanding the footprint of our domestic sales coverage to increase overall sales and diversify sales concentration risk 
growth of international sales has outpaced our domestic growth  and made up of total sales for the year as compared to of total sales for the same period in sales of our proprietary specialty chemicals continued to grow at a strong pace 
the sales of our environmentally friendly green chemicals increased million  or  from million for the year compared to million for the year ending december  in  our biodegradable specialty chemical additive received approval for use in the north sea and passed canadian biotox protocols  further expanding our geographic market penetration 
with this approval we began preparations to open our first international operation in the netherlands to service the european and african markets in a product that was developed in and will be marketing in is an environmentally friendly acid iron control system used to prevent the oxidation and deposition of iron in the formation 
gross profit increased million or for the year compared to gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from for the year to in the decrease in margin is attributable to an increase in cost of goods sold in our specialty chemical division without concurrently timed equivalent price increases to pass these costs on to our customers 
price increases were implemented in june and will continue to be evaluated by management throughout income from operations increased million  or  during compared to  primarily as a result of increased revenue in the chemical division and reduction of operating costs as a percentage of revenue 
the completion of the mexico and texas bulk handling plants also increased revenue and operating income for this segment during expansion of our proprietary product line and customer base has driven the increase in sales and operating income during drilling products for the years ended december  in thousands revenue gross profit gross profit income from operations income from operations results for fiscal compared to fiscal drilling products during and an emphasis was placed on expanding our drilling products sales through acquisition  allowing us to expand geographically and to grow our line of products and services 
in august we acquired the assets of harmon  a downhole oilfield and mining tool company with manufacturing and sales operations located in midland  texas  and the assets of lor  a drilling tool rental and inspection service provider in south texas 
in january we acquired the assets of can ok  a drilling tool sales and rental provider in oklahoma  louisiana and arkansas 
these acquisitions expanded or provided machining  repair  tool rental and inspection service capability within our drilling products group 
drilling products revenue increased million or for the year compared to the drilling tool acquisitions completed in august and january coupled with downhole mud motor rentals and higher centralizer sales contributed to the increase in overall sales 
gross profit increased million or for the year compared to gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from in versus for the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue relates to higher inventory related expenses 
in addition we incurred significant costs in building up our capacity and improving overall conditions with our acquired businesses 

table of contents income from operations increased million or for the year compared to costs associated with developing our machining and repair capacity  and the expenses required to improve facility conditions and equipment negatively impacts income from operations in for this division 
results for fiscal compared to fiscal drilling products drilling products revenue increased million for the year compared to this increase relates primarily to the expansion of our segment with the acquisition of spidle  harmon and lor 
spidle contributed million in revenue during harmon and lor  which were acquired in the third quarter of  contributed million in revenue 
gross profit increased million for the year compared to gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from in to in the decrease is attributable to a change in the base of operations with the addition of spidle  harmon and lor 
our turbeco operations have historically been focused on the manufacturing and marketing of drilling tools 
the acquisitions made during expand drilling tool operations into the manufacturing and marketing of a much broader offering of drilling tools  drilling tool rentals  mud motor rentals and pipe inspection services 
income from operations increased million during compared to  primarily due to the expansion of the division 
we believe we will continue to see improvements in income from operations as a percentage of revenue as we capitalize on the geographic  customer and product synergies among the three acquisitions made this year and the other business units  as well as increased utilization of the inventory acquired with spidle 
artificial lift previously known as production products for the years ended december  in thousands revenue gross profit gross profit income from operations income from operations results for fiscal compared to fiscal artificial lift in the second quarter of we acquired tws and liftech as part of our goal to develop a significant artificial lift segment and expand our production driven revenue base 
the combined companies provide a broad spectrum of electric submersible pumps  gas separators  valves and services to support the coal bed methane producers in the powder river basin region and beyond 
we believe the recent artificial lift acquisitions will provide additional marketing opportunities for our patented petrovalve line of pump components  our patented gas separator  and our line of electric submersible pumps 
management continues to focus on effectively marketing the petrovalve line of pump components 
our patented guided valves are the only product which can be placed horizontally allowing a pump to be placed at the production zone in horizontally completed wells reducing the effort needed to pump the product to the surface 
the petrovalve can effectively lift highly viscous oil in heavy oil or tar sand production zones 
because of this we signed an exclusive agreement with a major equipment distributor in canada and have aligned ourselves with a major domestic pump manufacturer to build pumps with our valve 
revenue was million for the year versus million in acquisitions accounted for million of the increase 
the strategic complement of tws and liftech  which operate now as flotek pump services  increased the company s production activity driven revenue base 

table of contents gross profit increased million primarily due to the acquisitions 
the gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from in to in the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue is due to a shift in product mix 
the product revenue associated with the two acquisitions are lower margin product sales compared to our existing petrovalve sales 
although several of our new products generate lower margins  they complement our existing businesses and allow the company to cross sell products and services in new markets  and spread corporate costs over a larger base of operations 
we believe we can improve the gross margins of the acquisitions primarily through better supply chain management and product mix 
income from operations increased from million in to million in results for fiscal compared to fiscal artificial lift revenue increased million in compared to due to sales to customers in russia  oman and venezuela 
gross profit also increased in compared to the artificial lift segment generated million in income from operations in as compared to a loss from operations of million in the turnaround in this group is a result of increased international revenue into central and south america  russia and the middle east 
we are focused on increasing total revenue in by partnering with pump manufacturers and expanding the segment by broadening our artificial lift products and services 
petrovalve is actively marketed in the us  canada  mexico  central america  south america  the middle east  russia and asia 
in petrovalve has representation in countries 
capital resources and liquidity capital resources and liquidity continued to improve during the year ended december  compared to the same period in during we generated net income of million based on a effective tax rate  versus million taxed at a effective tax rate in cash flows from operations increased significantly from million in to million in the improvement in cash flow from operations is a direct result of improved operating results offset by increased estimated tax payments based on the projected increase in our estimated effective tax rate 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million for was primarily a result of the acquisitions of can ok  tws and liftech coupled with significant capital expenditures to expand our chemicals and logistics and drilling products operations 
net working capital uses of cash increased million in versus an increase in uses of cash of million for the same period in the net increases in uses of working capital were primarily driven by a net million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in inventory offset by a million increase in accounts payables and accrued liabilities 
we anticipate working capital requirements to increase as we grow overall sales 
capital expenditures for totaled approximately million 
the most significant expenditures related to the expansion of our chemical manufacturing facilities and base of rental tools including the purchase of drilling mud motors 
the expansion of our chemical manufacturing facilities tripled our specialty chemical production capacity 
in and  flotek has built a significant inventory of downhole mud motors 
based on the success of the motors  flotek acquired a interest in cavo in january cavo is a complete downhole motor solutions provider specializing in the rental  servicing and sale of high performance mud motors for a variety of drilling applications 
looking to we anticipate significant capital expenditures associated with the construction of our liquids blending facility in louisiana and continued expansion of our mud motor fleet 
in february  we obtained the senior credit facility with wells fargo which includes a revolving loan agreement  equipment term loans and a real estate term loans 
in august we amended the senior credit 
table of contents facility 
the amendment to the senior credit facility increased the maximum amount outstanding on the revolving line of credit from the lesser of a million or b the sum of of eligible domestic trade accounts receivable and of eligible inventory  as defined 
the terms are interest only  maturing in august as of december   we had million outstanding under the revolving line of credit of the amended senior credit facility

as of december  the company had approximately million in vehicle loans and capitalized vehicle leases 
in january  we amended the senior credit facility in conjunction with the acquisition of triumph drilling tools 
the amendment to the senior credit facility increased the maximum amount outstanding on the revolving line of credit from the lesser of a million or b the sum of of eligible domestic trade accounts receivable and of eligible inventory  as defined 
the terms of the revolving loan agreement were modified to provide for borrowings that bear interest at libor rate plus basis points maturing in august the equipment term loan was amended to provide for borrowings of million bearing interest at libor rate plus basis points payable over months 
the amendment increased many of our principal covenants including our leverage ratio  fixed charge coverage ratio and net capital expenditures 
the real estate term loans remained unchanged 
our bank borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
based on the amended maturity date  the current revolving line of credit is classified as long term debt 
we have funded our capital requirements with operating cash flows  debt borrowings  and by issuing shares of our common stock 
common stock issued during is described below in the acquisition of can ok in january  we issued  shares of common stock 
in the acquisition of liftech in april  we issued  shares of common stock 
warrants to purchase  shares were exercised with proceeds of approximately million paid to the company
