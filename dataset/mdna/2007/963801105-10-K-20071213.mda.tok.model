item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to risks described under risk factors  and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we design  develop and manufacture innovative microelectronic and display components and systems for inclusion in high technology products used in the military  industrial  and commercial markets 
our microelectronic solutions include advanced semiconductor and state of the art multi chip packaging  as well as our proprietary process for applying anti tamper protection to mission critical semiconductor components in military applications 
our display solutions include enhanced flat panel display products  interface devices and electromechanical assemblies 
our customers  which include military prime contractors in the united states and europe as well as commercial oems  outsource many of their microelectronic and display components and systems to us as a result of the combination of our design  development and manufacturing expertise 
we were formed as a result of the merger between bowmar and edi in october at the time of the merger  bowmar was a manufacturer of high reliability electronic components and interface and mechanical devices  mainly for military applications 
edi was a manufacturer of commercial memory products for the 
table of contents telecommunications and networking markets and also had a small ruggedized display business serving the military and industrial markets 
this merger provided us with a diversified platform to expand our product offerings within both the military and commercial markets 
in order to complement our military industrial display business  we acquired panelview  a designer and manufacturer of enhanced commercial flat panel display products  in january following the acquisition  we consolidated our display operations into our panelview subsidiary 
in january  we acquired ids  a designer and manufacturer of membrane keypads  flexible circuits  sensors  control panels  and handheld and desktop electronic devices 
this acquisition allowed us to expand our interface device product offerings and enhance our subsystem solutions 
in addition  with ids design and manufacturing capabilities  we can now offer fully integrated system level solutions 
executive summary net sales for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately million  compared to net sales of million for fiscal microelectronic segment net sales increased million 
military industrial net sales in the microelectronic segment increased million  or  from fiscal as we shipped increased orders received in recent quarters 
commercial net sales in the microelectronic segment decreased million  or  from fiscal due to decreased sales to our high end institutional server customers and decreased demand from a customer in the hotel entertainment systems industry as their business slowed and they were acquired by their competitor 
display segment net sales decreased million  or from fiscal commercial net sales in the display segment decreased by million  or  from fiscal due to decreased sales to our tablet pc and our appliance customers as the economy softened  and was additionally impacted by the delay of shipments by our golf course global positioning system gps customer  which was somewhat offset by an increase in sales to a medical customer 
display segment net sales to military industrial customers decreased million  or  over fiscal a key indicator of our future sales is the amount of new orders received compared to current net sales  known as the book to bill ratio 
for the year  we had new orders of approximately million  which equates to a book to bill ratio of for the year 
microelectronic segment orders for the year were approximately million  which equates to a book to bill ratio of for the year 
bookings from our military customers continued their positive trend throughout the year and we expect bookings to continue at this level in fiscal bookings from our commercial customers also increased over the prior fiscal year and we expect modest growth in fiscal however  with the slowing economy  we are experiencing a slower turn of our backlog as commercial customers are pushing out shipments  resulting in higher backlog 
we expect this trend to continue during fiscal new orders for our microelectronic segment s anti tamper process technology were approximately million for the year and we had sales of approximately million 
we currently expect to see growth for anti tamper technology products over the next several years 
display segment orders for the year were approximately million  which equates to a book to bill ratio of for the year 
we expect display segment orders to increase in fiscal over fiscal however  as with the commercial microelectronic customers  as a result of the softening economy  we expect a slower turn of our display commercial backlog in fiscal than we have historically experienced 
our gross margins were approximately for fiscal as compared to approximately for fiscal gross margins in our microelectronic segment were for fiscal as compared to in fiscal military industrial margins in our microelectronics segment remained consistent at 
however  due to lower sales volume  underabsorbed overhead and a lower margin product mix  our commercial margins in this segment decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal due to the fact that many of our costs are fixed  if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing facilities at a high level  these fixed costs will not be fully absorbed  resulting in lower gross margins 
gross margins in our display segment were in fiscal as compared to in fiscal commercial margins in our display segment remained consistent at approximately 
military industrial margins in this segment decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  primarily as a result of a lower margin product mix 
our overall production has  at times  been affected by longer lead times for certain components  which may affect the timing and cost of sales during the year 
the availability and price of memory and display components  based on supply and demand  will increase and decrease on a monthly or quarterly basis 
when demand exceeds supply  prices generally increase and lead times lengthen 
when supply exceeds demand  prices generally decrease 
table of contents and lead times shorten 
the dynamic random access memory dram  including synchronous dram sdram  and double data rate ddr dram market supply has increased and we do not expect shortages in the near future 
dram prices decreased steadily during fiscal due to the oversupply of inventories 
more and more companies are transitioning from ddr to ddr ii and the ddr ii supply is expanding 
we expect prices to remain at these lower levels unless there is a scaling back of production over the next couple of quarters 
there could be a further reduction in prices as a demand driven downcycle is experienced due to adverse economic conditions such as a recession 
the flash memory supply has stabilized over the last few months 
prices have been volatile  increasing and decreasing throughout fiscal prices began declining again in september and we expect prices to stabilize or decrease slightly over the next couple of quarters 
the availability of lcds has stabilized as manufacturers continue to add capacity 
we experienced a modest decline in prices during fiscal lcd prices are expected to remain flat or rise slightly during the first half of fiscal additionally  certain customers require us to buy from specific vendors due to product specifications 
this  at times  subjects us to component supply constraints due to disruptions in suppliers production 
we have purchased and placed duplicate equipment for our max vu tm process technology in a manufacturing company located in china in order to be more competitive in the commercial display market for our tablet pc products 
production using this equipment began in the second quarter of fiscal and substantially all of our max vu tm products are currently being produced in china 
we anticipate moving manufacturing of other related products to china  which we believe will result in value to the company and our stockholders 
we continue to invest in the anti tamper process technology as we expect to secure additional opportunities in the years to come 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we found indicators of impairment related to our customer relationships intangible asset recorded as part of the interface data systems acquisition 
the primary portion of the write down was in the microelectronic segment s commercial related products as a result of a key customer s decreased demand for its hotel entertainment systems and the acquisition of this customer by their competitor  which represented a high concentration of the legacy customer base at the time of the acquisition 
the remainder resulted from the realignment of the display printing business from phoenix to columbus which was completed in the fourth quarter 
we wrote down all of the million of the unamortized customer relationships intangible asset related to the reporting unit 
as a result of the tightening economy and the slowdown in both our microelectronic and display segments commercial markets  we took some proactive steps at the end of the fiscal year to reduce expenses going forward 
a reduction in force was taken at the end of the fourth quarter which will result in annual savings of approximately million  primarily in operating expenses 
we incurred approximately million in severance costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of this measure 
should these markets not improve as expected  further reductions could be made in the future 
below are our fiscal strategic initiatives and a fourth quarter update of their progress class k certification to allow the company to provide military products intended for space applications 
update we successfully completed the formal class k audit with the defense supply center columbus dscc 
the company is officially a certified class k manufacturer 
the first k level kit has gone through line test and is moving through assembly and final test 
radiation shielding methods using high density metals are being investigated for microelectronic packaging 
during the quarter we booked a small order totaling million for a custom multi chip package for a space application and also quoted three new class k custom products 
we continue to visit potential customers 
pursuit of circuit card assembly cca for military customers 
update our engineering team finalized the layout of a complete gps receiver  including rf  power supplies  and signal conditioning 
an initial million contract is for the delivery of prototypes of a complete cca for use in a gps communications receiver 
the company expects to begin delivering these prototypes in february our surface mount lines have been upgraded with new equipment to make them more capable and flexible in production 
we will continue our discussions to create cca manufacturing partnerships with additional customers 

table of contents next generation anti tamper at technology for military and commercial applications 
update this new coating process is developing on schedule 
we are currently setting up additional equipment and process development for new material sets 
we estimate completion in the summer of new applications for industrial grade compact flash cf in ruggedized embedded computing systems including medical  flight systems  factory automation  test and measurement and instrumentation 
update the complete family of cf cards from mb to gb are available and are tested at industrial temperatures 
during the fourth quarter we continued promoting our cf cards and received a million order 
during fiscal our cf orders totaled over million 
we will continue to promote this new line of flash products to the industrial and medical markets 
next generation display enhancement technology  max vu tm ii technology 
update we developed proof of concept glass bonded lcd prototypes using two new optical bonding processes 
we developed a preliminary mass production cost model and we also initiated design validation testing on one process 
this will allow us to penetrate markets previously not served by our max vu tm i process 
we estimate that the new max vu tm ii process will be production ready by the middle of fiscal year fully integrated touch panel display products 
update during the fourth quarter we continued to demonstrate sunlight readable display systems with integrated touch sensors to various customers 
these displays have very low reflectance while retaining excellent brightness  enabling their use in very high brightness environments 
by utilizing our max vu tm optical bonding process  the clarity and contrast of these display systems are excellent and the stiffness and strength of the display system are substantially enhanced  increasing the ruggedness of the display and the quality of the touch or pen feel when using the touch sensor 
the positive feedback from our product demonstrations has resulted in samples being sent to multiple customers 
continue the stock repurchase program 
update on february   the board of directors authorized the second repurchase program to acquire up to an additional  or  shares  of our outstanding common stock 
the program is being implemented through a rule b stock purchase plan and the plan will expire when all authorized shares have been purchased or in april  whichever occurs first 
the plan authorized the repurchase of shares beginning in july as of november   we have purchased a total of  shares at an average price of  for approximately million  including commissions and fees 
pursuing strategic acquisitions 
update we have and will continue to evaluate various strategic acquisitions 
we continue to search for and evaluate companies that we believe could expand and augment our existing businesses 
net income for fiscal year was approximately million compared to net income of approximately million for fiscal the primary factors causing the decrease were lower gross profit of million primarily due to lower sales  higher selling expenses of million  higher research and development expenses of million and the million non cash write down of intangibles 
these factors were somewhat offset by an increase in interest income of million and decreased income tax expense of million 
we invested in our sales force this year  hiring additional sales executives to support the long term growth of the organization  and  while we did not benefit from higher sales in fiscal  increases in our bookings and backlog are positive signs that this investment will lead to increased sales in the future 

table of contents segments our product and market diversification as well as our broad customer base have allowed us to maintain relative sales stability and profitability 
the following table shows our net sales and the percent of total net sales by our two business segments and the markets they serve in thousands microelectronic segment military industrial market commercial market display segment military industrial market commercial market total microelectronic segment military industrial market commercial market display segment military industrial market commercial market total during fiscal  million  or  of our goods were shipped to foreign customers  compared to million  or  and million  or  in fiscal years and  respectively 
the slight decline in dollar value in fiscal relative to fiscal is primarily due to lower overall sales of the company 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include the following items we sell microelectronic and display products primarily to military prime contractors and commercial oems 
a small portion of our products are also sold through distributors or resellers 
we recognize revenue on product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer exists  title to the product has passed to the customer usually occurs at time of shipment  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility of the related billing is reasonably assured 
advance payments from customers are deferred and recognized when the related products are shipped 
revenue relating to products sold to distributors or resellers who either have return rights or where the company has a history of accepting product returns are deferred and recognized when the distributor or reseller sells the product to the end customer 
we also provide limited design services pursuant to related customer purchase orders and generally recognize the associated revenue as such services are performed 
however  it may be deferred until certain elements are completed 
we may from time to time enter into certain arrangements that contain multiple elements such as 
table of contents performing limited design services accompanied with follow on manufacturing of related products 
we allocate revenue to the elements based on relative fair value  and recognize revenue for each element when there is evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
arrangements with multiple elements that are not considered separate units of accounting require deferral of revenue until certain other elements have been delivered or the services have been performed 
the amount of the revenue recognized is impacted by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements  and whether the elements are considered separate units of accounting 
historically  we have experienced fluctuations in the demand for our products based on cyclical fluctuations in the microelectronic and display markets 
these fluctuations may cause inventory on hand to lose value or become obsolete 
in order to present the appropriate inventory value on our financial statements  we identify slow moving or obsolete inventories and record provisions to write down such inventories to net realizable value 
these provisions are based on management s comparison of the value of inventory on hand against expected future sales 
if future sales are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory provisions may be required 
we record trade accounts receivable at the invoiced amount and they do not bear interest 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we make these estimates based on an analysis of accounts receivable using available information on our customers financial status and payment histories 
historically  bad debt losses have not differed materially from our estimates 
write offs against the allowance totaled approximately  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal we maintain a pension plan for eligible union employees at our fort wayne  indiana facility 
to account for the cost of this plan  we make estimates concerning the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and discount rates to be used to calculate future benefit obligations 
changes in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets affect the amount of investment income expected to be earned in the future 
we base our related estimates using historical data on the rate of return from equities and fixed income investments  as well as projections for future returns on such investments 
if the actual returns on plan assets do not equal the estimated amounts  we may have to fund future benefit obligations with additional contributions to the plan 
changes in the discount rate affect the value of the plan s future benefit obligations 
a lower discount rate increases the liabilities of the plan because it raises the value of future benefit obligations 
this will also cause an increase in pension expense recognized 
we use published bond yields to estimate the discount rate used for calculating the value of future benefit obligations 
we account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
which requires goodwill to be tested for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently in certain circumstances and written down when impaired 
in fiscal it was determined that the goodwill in our commercial microelectronic reporting unit in phoenix and our display reporting unit in oregon were impaired 
accordingly  we wrote down the related goodwill by approximately million 
in fiscal  it was determined that our interface electronics reporting unit in the display segment was impaired 
accordingly  we wrote down all million of the unamortized ids acquisition goodwill related to this reporting unit 
goodwill recorded was million at september  and september  see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information relating to the goodwill impairments 
furthermore  sfas requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite 
purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets  generally two to fifteen years 
we also regularly evaluate intangible assets for impairment pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and evaluate the continued appropriateness of estimated future lives assigned to these assets 
in fiscal  it was determined that the intangible asset related to customer relationships recorded in as part of the ids acquisition in the phoenix based location was impaired 
we wrote down all million of the unamortized portion of this intangible asset 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information relating to the intangible asset impairment 

table of contents with the adoption of sfas r on october   we are required to record the fair value of stock based compensation awards as an expense 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  the company applies the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
while the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions  typically based on factual data derived from public sources  the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are recognized  net of any valuation allowance  for deductible temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and  if necessary  establish a valuation allowance 
during the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
these reserves are established when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest

table of contents fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales net sales were million for the year ended september   a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  military industrial net sales in the microelectronic segment were million for the year ended september   an increase of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  the increase was due to the shipment of increased orders received in recent quarters as we have experienced a higher demand for our products 
we expect net sales to military industrial customers to increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal commercial net sales in the microelectronic segment were million for the year ended september   a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  approximately million of the decrease was due to softness in the high end server business and the resulting lower demand for our products 
we expect this trend to continue 
we also experienced decreased demand for a customer s hotel entertainment systems due to a slowdown in their business and the acquisition of this customer by their competitor 
we shipped all remaining backlog during the fourth quarter and are uncertain at this time of expected future sales volume as they continue their integration 
however  we expect increased net sales in fiscal to our commercial microelectronic customers 
military industrial net sales in the display segment were million for the year ended september   a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  the decrease was primarily due to programs reaching their end of life which have been partially offset by new orders 
we expect military industrial net sales in the display segment in fiscal to grow slightly from sales in fiscal commercial net sales in the display segment were million for the year ended september   a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  the decrease from the prior year is attributable to decreased sales to our tablet pc and our appliance customers as the economy softened  and was additionally decreased by the delay of shipments from a golf course gps customer  which was somewhat offset by an increase in sales to our medical customers 
while we expect to lose one of our medical customers in fiscal due to pricing pressure  we expect commercial net sales in the display segment to increase slightly in fiscal arrow electronics accounted for approximately million  or  of our fiscal microelectronic segment net sales as compared to million  or  and million  or  of fiscal and fiscal microelectronic segment net sales  respectively 
on command corporation accounted for million  or  of our fiscal microelectronic segment net sales as compared to million  or  and million  or  of fiscal and fiscal microelectronic segment net sales  respectively 
hewlett packard company accounted for approximately million  or  of our fiscal display segment net sales as compared to million  or  of fiscal display segment net sales 
there were no sales to hewlett packard in fiscal there were no sales to ncr in fiscal however  ncr accounted for approximately million  or  and million  or  of fiscal and fiscal display segment net sales  respectively 
motion computing accounted for approximately million  or  of our fiscal display segment net sales as compared to million  or  and million  or  of fiscal and fiscal display segment net sales  respectively 
general electric accounted for approximately million  or  of our fiscal display segment net sales as compared to million  or  and million  or  of fiscal and fiscal display segment net sales  respectively 
the majority of our commercial sales are not subject to seasonal fluctuations over the course of a year 
sales of our membrane keypad products  which totaled approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal  are subject to seasonal fluctuations relating to home appliance sales in the spring and fall 
our military sales tend to follow the government s fiscal year  which ends in september  and are typically less in the first quarter of our fiscal year and more in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 

table of contents gross profit gross profit was million for the year ended september   a decrease of million  or  from million for the year ended september  gross margin as a percentage of net sales was approximately for the year ended september   compared to approximately for the year ended september  gross profit for the microelectronic segment was million for the year ended september   a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  the decrease resulted from a decrease in commercial gross profit as a result of lower sales volume and a corresponding lower absorbtion of overhead as well as a lower margin product mix 
this was offset by an increase in military gross profit fueled by an increase in sales volume slightly offset by a lower margin product mix 
gross margin as a percentage of microelectronic segment net sales was approximately for the year ended september   compared to approximately for the year ended september  the higher percentage of military industrial sales  which historically have a higher selling price and higher gross margin than commercial products  helped to maintain the overall gross margin percentage in fiscal gross profit for the display segment was million for the year ended september   a decrease of million  or  from million for the year ended september  gross margin as a percentage of display segment net sales was approximately for the year ended september   compared to approximately for the year ended september  commercial margins remained consistent at approximately 
military industrial margins decreased to approximately in fiscal from approximately in fiscal  primarily as a result of a lower margin product mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist mainly of compensation expense  selling expenses  including commissions  information technology expenses and corporate administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended september   an increase of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  this increase was due to an increase in selling expenses of million  offset by a million decrease in general and administrative expenses over the comparable period 
selling expenses increased primarily due to the hiring of additional sales executives to support the long term growth of the organization and higher commissionable sales 
general and administrative expenses decreased mainly because of a million gain recorded on the sale of the flower street land and building 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately as compared with for the prior year 
the increase was caused by the increase in expenses combined with lower overall net sales 
due to the continued compliance requirements related to the sarbanes oxley act  our expanded sales force and the expense related to the adoption of sfas r  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to average between and of net sales 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation for our engineering personnel  consulting expenses and project materials 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended september   an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended september  the increase was primarily attributable to increased expenditures for our next generation anti tamper technology 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales have been approximately to of net sales over the past three years 
we are committed to the research and development of new and existing products and expect research and development expenses to remain at approximately the same percentage of net sales in the future 
ongoing product development projects for the microelectronic segment include new packaging designs for various types of memory products including dram  ddr ii  flash and microprocessors  along with microprocessor modules and ball grid array packaging products using these semiconductors  continuing development of

income tax expense was million for the year ended september   compared to million for the year ended october  the effective tax rate was approximately for the year ended september   compared to for the 
table of contents year ended october  the company s effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory tax rate of due to the impact of state taxes and the goodwill impairment which has no income tax benefit  and is decreased by reductions for foreign sales exclusions  a new manufacturers deduction and research and experimentation tax credits 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
for fiscal  the effective rate of differed from the statutory tax rate of due to the incremental impact of state taxes and the million goodwill impairment which has no income tax benefit  partially offset by reductions for foreign sales exclusions  research and experimentation tax credits  and the adjustment of tax reserves 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the internal revenue service completed its examination of our federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended september  and september  based on the results of the examination  we decreased previously recorded tax reserves by approximately million and decreased income tax expense by a corresponding amount in fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash on hand as of september  totaled approximately million and was primarily invested in money market accounts 
during fiscal year  cash provided by operating activities was approximately million versus million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net income before the non cash intangible asset impairment charge and an increase in inventory offset by an increase in deferred revenue 
depreciation and amortization totaled approximately million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
we expect depreciation and amortization to remain consistent in fiscal accounts receivable in fiscal decreased approximately million from fiscal  primarily as a result of a corresponding decrease in fourth quarter net sales of million from the quarter ended september  days sales outstanding at september  was days  which was lower than the days at september  our days sales outstanding typically approximates days 
inventories increased approximately million from fiscal year inventory of approximately million as of september  represents days of inventory on hand  an increase from days on hand at september  the levels of inventory fluctuate based on changes in expected production requirements  the fulfillment of orders and availability of raw materials 
inventory amounts will generally take several quarters to adjust to significant changes in future sales 
also  as lead times for raw materials increase  we are required to purchase larger amounts of inventory per order and hold it for longer periods of time 
this has the effect of increasing our days inventory on hand 
during the second half of fiscal  we purchased bonded inventory of die for customers  bought some end of life material  and experienced some customer delays in shipments  all of which contributed to the increase in inventory 
we expect to fund any increases in inventory caused by sales growth or manufacturing planning requirements from our cash balances and operating cash flows  however  we do not expect further increases during fiscal prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased approximately million from the end of fiscal this was primarily due to the settlement and insurance payout of the shareholder lawsuit and the resulting reversal of the million receivable 
accrued expenses as of september  decreased approximately million from the end of fiscal accrued salaries and benefits were approximately million lower at september  compared to the end of fiscal due to lower accrued compensation 
other accrued expenses were approximately million lower  primarily due to the settlement and insurance payout of the shareholder lawsuit and the resulting reversal of the liability  partially offset by higher deferred revenue and the timing of income tax payments 
deferred revenue at september  was approximately million  and included approximately million of advance payments from customers 
purchases of property  plant and equipment during the year ended september  totaled approximately million  with million remaining in accounts payable at year end 
during this period  the purchases included million for our microelectronic manufacturing facilities  primarily for production equipment  and million for our display and interface manufacturing facilities

we expect to fund our pension obligation through returns on plan assets and our contributions to the plan over the next several years 
actual contributions will be dependent on the actual investment returns during that period 
there were no contributions to the plan in fiscal we believe that funding the plan over the next several years will not significantly impact our liquidity

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of september   we had no borrowings on our revolving line of credit with jpmorgan chase bank  na should we borrow against the line  interest charged on these borrowings would be at the lower of the jpmorgan chase bank  na prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
during fiscal  the bank s prime rate averaged and was as of september  we are subject to changes in the prime rate based on federal reserve actions and general market interest fluctuations 
we are also subject to fluctuations in the libor 
as of september   the libor was approximately 
should we begin borrowing against the credit line  annual interest expense at would be approximately  for every million borrowed 
a hypothetical increase in the interest rate would increase interest expense by approximately  per million borrowed on an annual basis 
we believe that moderate interest rate increases will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations  liquidity or financial position 
we believe that we are not subject in any material way to other forms of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk on foreign customer purchase orders we accept payment in us dollars only or commodity price risk
