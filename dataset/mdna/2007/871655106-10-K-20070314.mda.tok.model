item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition should be read together with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a diversified provider of outsourced services and specialty products 
we perform a wide range of manufacturing  engineering  design  testing and other technical services  typically under multi year  sole source contracts with major companies and government agencies in the markets for aerospace defense electronics  truck components assemblies  and test measurement services 
revenue from our three core markets accounted for approximately of our revenue for the year ended december   while revenue from our outsourced services accounted for approximately of our revenue 
we are organized into two business groups  the industrial group and the electronics group 
the industrial group is one reportable business segment  while the electronics group includes two reportable business segments  aerospace defense and test measurement 
the industrial group is comprised of sypris technologies  inc and its subsidiaries  which generates revenue primarily from the sale of manufacturing services to customers in the market for truck components assemblies and from the sale of products to the energy and chemical markets 
the aerospace defense reportable segment is comprised of sypris data systems  inc and sypris electronics  llc 
revenue from this group is derived primarily from the sale of manufacturing services  technical services and products to customers in the market for aerospace defense electronics 
the test measurement reportable segment consists solely of sypris test measurement  inc  which generates revenue primarily from providing technical services for the calibration  certification and repair of test and measurement equipment in the us our objective is to become the leading outsourcing specialist in each of our core markets for aerospace defense electronics  truck components assemblies  and test measurement services 
we have focused our efforts on establishing long term relationships with industry leaders who embrace multi year contractual relationships as a strategic component of their supply chain management 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
changes in facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting estimated amounts included in our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more complex judgments and estimates 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition in the industrial group  including cost of sales  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable based on overall receivable aging levels  a specific evaluation of accounts for customers with known financial difficulties and evaluation of customer chargebacks  if any 
these reserves and corresponding write offs could significantly increase if our customers experience deteriorating financial results or in the event we receive a significant chargeback  which is deemed uncollectible 
impairments 
goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment by calculating the estimated fair value of each business with which goodwill is associated 
the estimated fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis that requires judgment in our evaluation of the business and establishing an appropriate discount rate and terminal value to apply in the calculations 
in selecting these and other assumptions for each business  we consider historical performance  forecasted operating results  general market conditions and industry considerations specific to the business 
it is possible that the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment charges may occur 
we likely would compute a materially different fair value for a business if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change 

table of contents at december   net assets of our test measurement segment were million  including goodwill of million 
our test measurement segment reported an operating loss in of million  primarily as a result of decreased component screening and product sales 
as restructuring efforts continue to pay back and calibration revenues continue to grow  operating income improvement is expected in if continued improvement in our test measurement operations is not achieved and profitability deteriorates  we may be required to record an impairment charge to goodwill for the test measurement segment 
the recoverability of long lived assets is evaluated if impairment indicators exist 
indicators of impairment include historical financial performance  operating trends and our future operating plans 
if impairment indicators exist  we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets based on forecasted undiscounted cash flows 
if an impairment has occurred  the long lived asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted basis 
the estimation of future cash flows requires management s judgment concerning historical performance  forecasted operating results  general market conditions and industry considerations specific to the assets 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgments in applying these factors to the analysis of long lived asset impairment 
it is possible that the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment charges may occur 
we likely would compute a materially different estimate of future cash flows if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change 
long term contracts a large part of our aerospace defense segment business is derived from long term contracts for development  production and service activities which we account for consistent with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government contractors  the aicpa s statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature  as applicable 
we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when we determine the proper accounting for a particular contract 
primarily  we record long term  fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing net revenue 
revenue is recognized on these contracts when units are shipped or delivered to the customer  as applicable  with unit revenue based upon unit prices as set forth in the applicable contracts 
the costs attributed to contract revenue are based upon the estimated average costs of all units to be shipped 
for example  we use this method of revenue recognition on our encryption programs 
in less frequent circumstances  we enter into milestone specific  fixed price contracts for which net revenue is recorded when we achieve performance milestones 
revenue recognized under such milestones is limited to net revenue that we would recognize under the cost to cost method 
under the cost to cost method of accounting  revenue is recognized based on the ratio of costs incurred to our estimate of total costs at completion 
for example  we use this methodology for our cec  common card and ki programs 
as we incur costs under cost reimbursement type contracts  we record net revenue 
cost reimbursement type contracts include time and materials and other level of effort type contracts 
an example of this type of revenue recognition includes the jwarn program 
as a general rule  we recognize net revenue and profits earlier in a production cycle when we use the cost to cost and milestone methods of percentage of completion accounting than when we use the units of delivery method 
in addition  our profits and margins may vary materially depending on the types of long term government contracts undertaken  the costs incurred in their performance  the achievement of other performance objectives  and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees is finally determined 
contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenues and costs  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the size and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor and subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials 
for contract change orders  claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 

table of contents the majority of our aerospace defense segment net revenue is driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the us government  and therefore not necessarily on market based factors 
cost based pricing is determined under the federal acquisition regulations far 
the far provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under us government contracts 
for example  costs such as those related to charitable contributions  advertising  interest expense  and public relations are unallowable  and therefore not recoverable through net revenue 
approximately  and of total net revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion method based on units of delivery during  and  respectively 
approximately  and of total net revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion method based on milestones or cost to cost during  and  respectively 
therefore  the amounts we record in our consolidated financial statements using contract accounting methods and cost accounting standards are material 
because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenues or costs are required  any changes from prior estimates are generally included in earnings in the current period 
we closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting 
in addition to less formal monthly reviews  management in the aerospace defense segment formally assess the status of contracts on a quarterly basis through extensive estimate at completion reviews which include multiple levels of program personnel 
costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are reviewed for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel  and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency 
pension plan funded status pension assets and liabilities are complex estimation processes based on third party actuarially determined estimates  which rely on management estimates of the discount rate and rate of return on plan assets 
changes in these rates could significantly impact the actuarially determined amounts recorded in the statement of financial position 
reserve for excess  obsolete and scrap inventory we record inventory at the lower of cost  determined under the first in  first out method  or market and do reserve for excess  obsolete or scrap inventory 
these reserves are primarily based upon management s assessment of the salability of the inventory  historical usage of raw materials  historical demand for finished goods  and estimated future usage and demand 
an improper assessment of salability or improper estimate of future usage or demand  or significant changes in usage or demand could result in significant changes in the reserves and a positive or a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations in the period the change occurs 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions using the black scholes option pricing method  which requires the input of several subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based compensation and  consequently  the related expense recognized on the consolidated statement of operations 
results of operations the tables presented below  which compare our consolidated results of operations from one year to another  present the results for each year  the change in those results from one year to another in both dollars and percentage change and the results for each year as a percentage of net revenue 
the first two data columns in each table show the absolute results for each year presented 
the columns entitled year over year change and year over year percentage change show the change in results  both in dollars and percentages 
these two columns show favorable changes as positive and unfavorable changes as negative 
for example  when our net revenue increases from one year to the next  that change is shown as a positive number in both columns 
conversely  when expenses increase from one year to the next  that change is shown as a negative number in both columns 
the last two columns in each table show the results for each period as a percentage of net revenue 
in these two columns  the cost of sales and gross profit for each are given as a percentage of that segment s net revenue 
these amounts are shown in italics

the industrial group derives its revenue from manufacturing services and product sales 
net revenue in the industrial group for the year increased million to million primarily due to million in additional volume  million of material pricing pass through and million of price increases which were offset by the cessation of two business lines 
we expect revenues to continue to decline in in line with the forecasted dip in demand for heavy and light duty truck markets 

table of contents the aerospace defense segment derives its revenue from product sales and technical outsourced services 
aerospace defense segment net revenue decreased million to million due to a million decline in volume as a result of one encryption product completing its life cycle during  while the launch of the next generation product was delayed into  as well as maturing manufacturing service programs and declines in data storage product sales

table of contents net revenue 
net revenue in the industrial group for the year increased due to higher volume resulting from the new arvinmeritor and dana contracts that started in may and june of  respectively 
these new contracts with arvinmeritor for trailer axle beams and various drive train components and with dana for steer axles  drive axle shafts and drive train components for the light  medium and heavy duty truck markets generated outsourced services revenue of million in  as compared to million in excluding the new contracts  the industrial group s net revenue increased million  or  in  primarily due to record demand for medium and heavy duty trucks as a result of pre buy activity ahead of a change in domestic emission requirements 
the aerospace defense segment derives its revenue from manufacturing services  other outsourced services and product sales 
manufacturing services revenue accounted for approximately and of total aerospace defense segment revenue in and  respectively 
manufacturing services revenue increased million in primarily due to increased volume on two military programs and revenue from new customers for initial shipments on new contracts 
net revenue from technical outsourced services decreased million in primarily due to the completion of an engineering program in net revenue from product sales decreased million primarily due to decreased demand for legacy data storage products 
the test measurement segment derives its revenue from technical services and product sales 
technical services revenue accounted for approximately and of total test measurement revenue in and  respectively 
products sales increased million in  primarily due to increased shipments on a military program  while revenue from technical services was consistent with the prior year 
gross profit 
the industrial group s gross profit decreased million in associated with start up programs and capacity constraints in addition to increased energy costs 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to for from in  primarily due to costs associated with the increase in manufacturing capacity  launch of new programs  overtime to meet customer shipment schedules and increased natural gas costs 
the factors impacting gross profit in the fourth quarter included higher natural gas and overtime along with the impact of declining overhead absorption rates resulting from inventory reduction initiatives 
the aerospace defense segment s gross profit decreased million in primarily due to lower data storage product sales and technical outsourced revenue 
lower overhead absorption attributable to decreased product revenue reduced gross profit by million for technical outsourced services gross profit decreased by from primarily due to lower revenue 
gross margin for the aerospace defense segment was in as compared to in the decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from the lower volume and related margins for product sales  which was partially offset by higher volume for manufacturing services

table of contents liquidity  capital resources and financial condition net cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million in the cash provided by operating activities in includes a net decrease in working capital investment primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable and inventories of and million  respectively 
the reduction in working capital in was primarily driven by the continued execution of our working capital management program along with improved payment terms negotiated in with various significant customers 
net cash used in investing activities was million in as compared to million in capital expenditures decreased to million in from million in capital expenditures in for our industrial group were million principally comprised of forging  machining  and centralized tooling equipment  while capital expenditures for our aerospace defense and test measurement segments were million and million  respectively  principally comprised of manufacturing  assembly and test equipment 
capital expenditures in for the industrial group were million  while capital expenditures in for our aerospace defense and test measurement segments were million and million  respectively 
the reduction of capital expenditures in the industrial group for is the result of our expected gradual return to normal levels of capital expenditures  after our initial investments in new plants  forging technology and automation 
capital expenditures decreased in for the aerospace defense segment as several programs neared completion and new programs required less new capital investment than in prior years 
net cash used in financing activities was million in as compared to million in in  we made net repayments totaling million on our revolving credit facility as a result of cash flow from operations under our various working capital management initiatives 
we had total borrowings under our revolving credit facility of million at december   and an unrestricted cash balance of million 
approximately million of the unrestricted cash balance relates to our mexican subsidiaries 
at the end of  maximum borrowings permitted under the revolving credit facility were million  subject to a million limit for letters of credit of which million were issued 
the credit agreement included an option to increase the amount of available credit to million from million  subject to the lead bank s approval 
in march  we agreed to terms with our bank group to amend the revolving credit agreement to limit total borrowings at million  with million of additional borrowings available upon lead bank approval  extend the credit agreement through october  revise certain financial covenants providing more flexibility in our financing structure and add a security interest in our accounts receivable  inventory and equipment 
under the agreed to terms  other terms of the credit agreement remain substantially unchanged 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be used to finance working capital requirements  acquisitions and for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures 
most acquisitions require the approval of our bank group 
we intend to use such borrowing capacity to ratably repay million of the outstanding senior notes 
we also agreed to terms to amend our senior notes in march to enable the aforementioned repayment of million of the outstanding senior notes  revise certain financial covenants  modify the june  principle payment to june   update our fixed interest rates and among other things  add a perfected security interest in our accounts receivable  inventory and equipment 
under the agreed to terms  other terms of the senior notes remain substantially unchanged 
our principal commitments at december  consisted of repayments of borrowings under the credit agreement and senior notes  pension obligations and obligations under operating leases for certain of our real property and equipment 
estimated pension contributions for are expected to range from million to million 
we also had purchase commitments totaling approximately million at december   primarily for inventory and manufacturing equipment

table of contents at december  we also had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future federal taxable income 
such carryforwards will increase future cash flows  if utilized  and reflect income tax losses incurred 
approximately  million and million of the carryforwards will expire on december  and  respectively 
we believe that sufficient resources will be available to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months depend on our profitability  our ability to manage working capital requirements and our rate of growth 
if we make significant acquisitions  if our largest customers experience financial difficulty  or if working capital and capital expenditure requirements exceed expected levels during the next twelve months or in subsequent periods  we may require additional external sources of capital 
there can be no assurance that any additional required financing will be available through bank borrowings  debt or equity financings or otherwise  or that if such financing is available  it will be available on terms acceptable to us 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  our business  consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
all borrowings under our credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate based on the prime rate  the london interbank offered rate libor  or certain alternative short term rates  plus a margin at december  based upon our leverage ratio 
a change in interest rates of basis points would not significantly change interest expense on an annualized basis  based upon our debt outstanding at december  a change in interest rates of basis points would change the fair value of our senior notes by million 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have historically impacted our earnings only to the extent of remeasurement gains related to us dollar denominated accounts of our foreign subsidiary  because the vast majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
a one percent change in foreign currency exchange rates would result in remeasurement gain or loss of approximately million on an annualized basis  based upon the us dollar denominated accounts of our foreign subsidiary at december  inflation has not been a significant factor in our operations in any of the periods presented  however  there can be no assurances that the growth in our industrial group s business combined with significant increases in the costs of steel will not adversely affect our working capital requirements and our associated interest costs  which could also increase the sensitivity of our results to changes in interest rates
