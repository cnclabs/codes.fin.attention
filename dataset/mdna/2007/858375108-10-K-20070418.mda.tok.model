item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview stein mart s stores offer the fashion merchandise  service and presentation of a better department or specialty store  at prices competitive with off price retail chains 
currently with locations from california to new york  stein mart s focused assortment of merchandise features moderate to designer brand name apparel for women and men  as well as accessories  gifts  linens and shoes 
management believes that stein mart differentiates itself from typical off price retailers by offering i current season merchandise carried by better department and specialty stores at value prices  ii a stronger merchandising statement  with more depth of color and size  and iii merchandise presentation more comparable to other upscale retailers 
the company faces competition for customers and for access to quality merchandise from better department stores  fine specialty stores and  to a lesser degree  from off price retail chains 
many of these competitors are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources than the company 
the retail apparel industry is highly fragmented and competitive  and the off price retail business may become even more competitive in the future

the small increase in net sales from comparable stores was primarily due to a decrease in net sales from comparable stores during the fourth quarter

income from operations for the year ended january  was million compared to million for approximately million of this earnings improvement is the result of reducing the effect of operating losses of stores closed during and and the remainder is due to improved operating results of ongoing stores 
the company earned interest income of million on its cash and short term investments during compared to  net of  interest expense during due to no borrowings on its revolving credit agreement during most of and all of liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity is the sale of its merchandise inventories 
capital requirements and working capital needs are funded through a combination of internally generated funds  a revolving credit facility and credit terms from vendors 
working capital is needed to support store inventories and capital investments for new store openings and to maintain existing stores 
historically  the company s working capital needs are lowest in the first quarter and highest in either the third or fourth quarter in anticipation of the fourth quarter peak selling season 
as of february   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in less cash was provided by operating activities during compared to primarily due to million less net income  a million increase in inventories and a million decrease in accounts payable 
we began to build inventories during the second half of to support a revamped home area  the expanded intimate  special size and casual categories  nine new fall stores  and a better transition in our resort stores

the cost of opening a typical new store generally ranges from  to  for fixtures  equipment  leasehold improvements and pre opening costs primarily advertising  stocking and training 
pre opening costs are expensed at the time of opening 
initial inventory investment for a new store is approximately million 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r in  the company presented all tax benefits resulting from share based compensation arrangements as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires that tax benefits resulting from share based compensation in excess of compensation cost recognized be classified as financing cash flows 
as a result  million of excess tax benefits has been classified as financing cash flows for the year ended february  the company has a million senior revolving secured credit agreement with a group of lenders  with an initial term ending at february   there were no direct borrowings and no event of default existed under the terms of the agreement 
the company believes that expected net cash provided by operating activities and unused borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to fund anticipated current and long term capital expenditures  working capital requirements and dividend payments 
should current operating conditions deteriorate  management can borrow on the revolving credit agreement or adjust operating plans  including new store rollout 
contractual obligations to facilitate an understanding of the company s contractual obligations  the following payments due by period data is provided in thousands total less than year years years after years operating leases at february   the company had no direct borrowings on its credit facility 
other long term liabilities on the balance sheet include deferred income taxes  deferred compensation  deferred rent liability and other long term liabilities that do not have specific due dates  so are excluded from the preceding table 
other long term liabilities also include long term store closing reserves  a component of which is future minimum payments under non cancelable leases for closed stores 
these future minimum lease payments total million and are included in the above table 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has outstanding standby letters of credit totaling million securing certain insurance programs at february  if certain conditions were to occur under these arrangements  the company would be required to satisfy the obligations in cash 
due to the nature of these arrangements and based on historical experience  the company does not expect to make any payments  therefore  the letters of credit are excluded from the preceding table 
there are no other off balance sheet arrangements that could affect the financial condition of the company 
seasonality the company s business is seasonal in nature with a higher percentage of the company s merchandise sales and earnings generated in the fall and holiday selling seasons 
accordingly  sg a expenses are typically higher as a percent of net sales during the first three quarters of each year 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while the company believes that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements  the company cannot guarantee that its estimates and assumptions will be accurate  which could require the company to make adjustments to these estimates in future periods 
following is a summary of the more significant accounting policies inventories 
merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market  on a first in first out basis  using the retail inventory method rim 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry 
the use of rim results in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail values of inventories 
based on a review of historical markdowns  current business trends and seasonal inventory categories  additional inventory reserves may be recorded to reflect estimated markdowns which may be required to liquidate certain inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market 
management believes its inventory valuation methods approximate the net realizable value of clearance inventory and result in valuing inventory at the lower of cost or market 
vendor allowances 
the company receives allowances from some of its vendors primarily related to markdown reimbursements  damaged defective merchandise and vendor compliance issues 
allowances received from vendors related to profitability of inventory recently sold and damaged defective inventory are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold 
allowances received due to compliance issues primarily violations of shipping and merchandise preparation requirements are reflected as a reduction of the cost of the merchandise 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors used in the review include management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and projected cash flows 
for long lived assets held for use  an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows from the use of the assets is less than the carrying value of the assets 
the amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value 
fair value is based on estimated market values for similar assets 
store closing costs 
the company follows sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  to record store closing costs 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
insurance reserve estimates 
the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance for various risks including workers compensation  general liability and associate related health care benefits  a portion of which is paid by the covered employees 
the company is responsible for paying the claims that are less than the insured limits 
the reserves recorded for these claims are estimated actuarially  based on claims filed and claims incurred but not reported 
these reserve estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims filed and settled 
the estimated accruals for these reserves could be significantly affected if future claims differ from historical trends and other actuarial assumptions 
revenue recognition 
revenue from sales of the company s merchandise is recognized at the time of sale  net of any returns and allowances  discounts and percentage off coupons 
future merchandise returns are estimated based on historical experience 
sales tax collected from customers is not recognized as revenue and is included in accrued liabilities 
leased department sales are excluded from net sales  commissions  net of related selling expenses  and rental income from leased departments are included in other income  net 
operating leases 
the company leases retail stores under operating leases 
certain lease agreements contain rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions 
the company recognizes rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term and records the difference between the amounts charged to expense and the rent paid as a deferred rent liability 
the landlord lessor constructs the building leasehold improvements for the majority of the company s stores 
for other store operating leases which require the company lessee to construct the building leasehold improvements  these assets are considered to be landlord assets and the company records the cost of these leasehold improvements in excess of any landlord construction allowance received as prepaid rent which is amortized to rent expense over the lease term 
share based compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaced sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and superseded accounting principles board apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize expense in the financial statements for the fair values of all share based payments to employees over the employees requisite service periods 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
no longer are an alternative to financial statement recognition 
effective january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r and elected to apply the modified prospective transition method 
accordingly  financial statement amounts for the prior periods presented in this form k have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of expensing share based compensation 
for a complete listing of our significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with statement of financial standards sfas no 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on derecognition  classification and disclosure of tax positions 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with the cumulative effect of initially adopting this interpretation being recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
while our analysis of the impact of this interpretation is not yet complete  we do not anticipate it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements at the time of adoption 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principals  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements  but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance provided in previous accounting pronouncements 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those years 
earlier application is encouraged  provided the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year 
management does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance which is meant to eliminate the diversity of practice in quantifying identified misstatements by putting forward a single quantification framework to be used by all public companies 
the company adopted the provisions of sab in the fourth quarter of as its provisions were effective for fiscal years ending on or after november  the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

the facility permits debt commitments up to million  has a january maturity date and bears interest at spreads over the prime rate and libor 
at february   the company had no direct borrowings on its credit facility 
management believes that its exposure to market risk associated with its borrowings is not material
