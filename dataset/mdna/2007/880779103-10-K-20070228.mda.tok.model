overview we continue to be encouraged by current trends and our performance for the year ended december  specifically  we experienced strong sales growth during the year  as previously implemented pricing actions  operational improvements and continued strong end markets were reflected in our results for with regard to sales  a major factor in our performance was the significantly improving economic condition of many of our end markets and customers  including the rental market  the mining industry  the global crane market and the market for mobile crushing and screening products  which favorably impacted our financial performance 
global crane demand continues to significantly outpace our current ability to produce and supply product  leading to a large current order backlog 
certain of our construction products  mainly material handling equipment  have shown signs of market contraction relative to the prior year period  and production difficulties in certain construction product lines negatively impacted our performance 
we anticipate continued strong end markets in  with most products continuing to participate in an expanding global marketplace 
for example  we expect opportunities for continued strength in the aerial work platforms and materials processing mining businesses 
additionally  our crane businesses have been experiencing strong end market demand globally due to numerous infrastructure initiatives  and they continue to improve their operating performance 
our roadbuilding and utility businesses  and other manufactured products related to infrastructure improvement  other than our concrete mixer truck business  have begun to experience increases in demand  and we expect this to continue in we believe the roadbuilding and utility end markets are in the early phases of recovery and will offset the slowdown in the concrete mixer truck business  which is impacted by the decline in residential construction spending 
however  our construction businesses continue to lag behind the performance of many of our other businesses 
we are addressing these issues in a manner that will take several years to fully implement  although we do expect meaningful short term improvements from these businesses  as new construction products should contribute to our profitability and growth 
longer term  we plan to build a more cohesive and expansive distribution network and to source production in more efficient and cost effective markets  which should benefit the construction businesses 
we have made several important decisions since the start of the second quarter of that are expected to positively contribute to our future financial performance 
in april  we completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in sichuan crane  a chinese crane manufacturer 
this is our first manufacturing location in china specifically focused on the crane market and is an important step towards developing better customer relations and capabilities in that important end market 
on june   we repaid million principal amount of our outstanding senior subordinated notes  and on august   we repaid the remaining million principal amount of these notes 
additionally  on july   we entered into a new senior credit facility that provides us with increased revolving borrowing abilities and additional operational flexibility 
finally  on january   we repaid the entire outstanding million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes 
these actions represent major steps in the continued improvement of our capital structure  reducing our overall interest cost and allowing us to more effectively manage our cash balances 
recent upgrades from the major debt rating agencies of the company and its senior debt reflect the improvement in our capital structure 
as a further step  in december our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common shares through june  in  we anticipate increasing expenditures to support certain business initiatives and objectives  taking advantage of our improved balance sheet position  including expanding the terex financial services business  developing the terex dealer of the future distribution concept and growing asian manufacturing capability 
in  we introduced the terex business system  an operating initiative aimed at improving our internal processes for the benefit of our customers  stakeholders and team members 
the tbs strategy is a long term initiative to foster continuous improvement in quality  speed and simplicity 
we remain committed to delivering strong incremental margin improvements in by realizing the benefits of pricing actions  volume leverage and an increasingly effective management of supply costs 
we will concentrate on the implementation of lean practices across our locations  and continue to strive for a target of working capital investment as a percentage of annualized sales  driven mainly by inventory turn improvement 
working capital is calculated using the consolidated balance sheet amounts for trade receivables net of allowance plus inventories less trade accounts payable 
for the year ended december   working capital as a percentage of the current quarter s annualized net sales stood at 
we believe that this calculation is a valuable measurement of efficiency in our use of resources 
return on invested capital  or roic  continues to be the unifying metric we use to measure our operating performance 
roic measures how effectively we use money invested in our operations 
in  we achieved an roic of  compared to roic in and our roic target of 
roic is determined by dividing the last four quarters income from operations including operating income from discontinued operations by the average of the sum of total stockholders equity plus debt less cash and cash equivalents for the last five quarters 
debt is calculated using the amounts for notes payable and current portion of long term debt plus long term debt  less current portion

end markets in the united states continued to show improvement linked to the passage of the federal highway and energy spending bills 
gross profit in totaled million  an increase of million when compared to gross profit margin improved in the utilities business  with the other businesses showing a slight decline 
gross profit margin in this largely united states based business segment was favorably impacted by pricing actions  as well as the positive effects of certain reorganization activities that were implemented over the prior few years  partially offset by increases in component costs 
this was partially offset by costs associated with the reduction in the company s re rental fleet  mainly in the third and fourth quarters of sg a costs for the segment in totaled million  an increase of million when compared to the net increase was mainly due to increased sales commission costs in the roadbuilding businesses  primarily in support of growth in the brazilian roadbuilding operation  as well as costs related to sales growth in other asphalt products 
general and administration costs increased primarily due to increased personnel related costs to support management s on going initiative to improve talent throughout this segment and the current consolidation of a previously existing distribution joint venture 
during the fourth quarter of  a goodwill impairment in the atc reporting unit was recognized due to an evaluation of carrying value in excess of its projected discounted cash flow  due mainly to a reduction in anticipated military vehicle contracts and the impact of continued funding delays from our minority partner in atc 
income from operations for our roadbuilding  utility products and other segment in was million  an increase of million when compared to the increase was due primarily to the favorable impact of pricing actions and the positive effect of recent cost reduction activities 
corporate eliminations of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales income from operations our consolidated results include the elimination of intercompany sales activity between segments 
additionally  certain expenses at the corporate level were not allocated to the business segments  which in were primarily attributable to the increased cost of certain equity and long term compensation programs as well as certain unallocated expenses related to our global enterprise system implementation 
net interest expense during  our net interest expense decreased by million to million as compared to net interest expense of million in the prior year 
this decrease was primarily driven by our lower debt balances 
loss on early extinguishment of debt we recorded a charge on early extinguishment of debt of million  including a million expense associated with the call premiums for the repayment of million of outstanding debt in june and august in addition  we recorded million of amortization of debt acquisition costs accelerated because of this debt repayment and the termination of our previous credit facility 
other income expense net other income expense net for was income of million  compared to income of million for the prior year 
the decrease in other income expense relates primarily to higher minority interest expense in consolidated subsidiaries combined with non recurring gains on the sale of fixed assets in income taxes during the year ended december   we recognized income tax expense of million on income from continuing operations before income taxes of million  an effective rate of  as compared to income tax expense of million on income from continuing operations before income taxes of million  an effective rate of  in the prior year 
the effective tax rate for was slightly higher than in the prior year  primarily due to changes in the geographical distribution of earnings 
compared with terex consolidated of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a goodwill impairment income from operations during  we continued to focus on external growth and on internal process improvement actions 
increasing demand for our products from general economic recovery in several end markets  as well as increasing penetration in new and existing markets  contributed to strong sales growth 
growth in income from operations from increased sales volume was dampened by cost pressures experienced in many purchased commodities and components  mainly steel  as well as certain internal inefficiencies arising from significantly increased production levels 
we also generated approximately million of cash from operations and reduced our net debt defined as total debt less cash by approximately million during net sales for were  million  an increase of  million when compared to we continued to realize the benefits of end market recoveries  the integration of our businesses  cost savings initiatives put in place over the prior three years  and the impact of the terex business system

gross profit improved as a result of increased volume and higher margin earned on the sale of new machines 
the performance of reedrill added million of gross profit and improvement in the materials processing business also contributed to the increase in gross profit 
this improvement was partially offset by increased steel costs 
sg a expense increased by million in relative to  to million 
the increase in sg a was mainly due to costs related to additional resources needed to address higher net sales and million due to the inclusion of reedrill 
income from operations for our materials processing mining segment was million in  an increase of million from million in the increase was a result of higher demand for the segment s products resulting primarily from improved commodity pricing relative to  the additional income from operations of million related to reedrill and improved performance in the materials processing business  offset to some degree by increased steel costs 
terex roadbuilding  utility products and other of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a goodwill impairment income from operations net sales for our roadbuilding  utility products and other segment in were million  an increase of million when compared to growth was achieved in most business units  especially in the concrete mixer truck business 
gross profit in totaled million  an increase of million when compared to gross profit generally improved across all businesses 
however  this improvement was partially offset by steel cost increases  as steel is a major material component for many of this group s products  as well as continued weak end markets in the roadbuilding and utility areas 
gross profit was also negatively impacted by operating inefficiencies at utility distribution sites regarding installation of products  additional costs for the specialty vehicle businesses  including inventory charges  and rental fleet reduction costs 
sg a costs for the segment in totaled million  an increase of million when compared to the increase in sg a costs compared to is mainly due to the sales volume increase  additional proposal activities and product development efforts 
during the fourth quarter of  a goodwill impairment in the atc reporting unit was recognized as the carrying value of goodwill was in excess of its projected discounted cash flow  due mainly to a reduction in anticipated military vehicle contracts and the impact of continued funding delays from our minority partner in atc 
income from operations for our roadbuilding  utility products and other segment in was million  an increase of million when compared to the positive change reflected strong performance by the concrete mixer truck business and the improvement initiatives taken over the past few years 
this was partially offset by the impact of increased steel costs and the additional costs for the specialty vehicle businesses 
corporate eliminations of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales income from operations net sales eliminations increased in over the prior year  due mainly to the efforts to cross sell our products through existing distribution channels  largely our construction and cranes products being distributed through our aerial work platforms segment channels 
the decrease in income from operations in was due mainly to external professional fees related to our investigation and audit of our historical accounting of approximately million  increased costs associated with long term incentive programs  and additional expenses resulting from increases in internal staffing to support ongoing efforts to address financial reporting weaknesses 
net interest expense during  our net interest expense increased by million to million as compared to net interest expense of million in the prior year 
higher interest rates more than offset the decrease in debt balances 
loss on early extinguishment of debt we initiated three debt reductions during on june   we prepaid million aggregate principal amount of term debt under our bank credit facility 
in connection with this prepayment  we recorded a related non cash charge of million 
on july   we prepaid million aggregate principal amount of term debt under our bank credit facility 
in connection with this prepayment  we recorded a related non cash charge of million 
on december   we prepaid million aggregate principal amount of term debt under our bank credit facility 
in connection with this prepayment  we recorded a related non cash charge of million 
the non cash charges in related to the write off of unamortized debt acquisition costs 
other income expense net other income expense net for was income of million as compared to income of million for the prior year 
the primary drivers of other income in were the gains related to the sale of fixed assets and the allocation of equity income loss to minority interests  which more than offset the amortization of debt acquisition costs 
in  million of other income expense net related primarily to the gain on sale of idle facilities and a favorable settlement related to the acquisition of the o k mining shovel business  which was offset partly by amortization of debt acquisition costs 
income taxes during the year ended december   we recognized income tax expense of million on income before income taxes of million  an effective rate of  as compared to income tax benefit of million on income before income taxes of million  an effective rate of  in the prior year 
the effective tax rate was higher than the prior year due mainly to the release of a valuation allowance of million on us deferred tax assets in  resulting from improved performance in several us businesses indicating that it was more likely than not that the assets would be realized 
the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the release of valuation allowances in certain of our german businesses as a result of activities to simplify the legal entity structure and the improved performance of these businesses that indicated that it was more likely than not that the assets would be realized 
also in  we repatriated certain non us earnings from controlled foreign subsidiaries  pursuant to the provisions of the american jobs creation act of the tax expense on repatriated earnings partially offset the valuation allowance release impact on the tax rate in critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
changes in the estimates and assumptions used by management could have significant impact on our financial results 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following are among our most significant accounting polices which are important in determining the reporting of transactions and events and which utilize estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and therefore are based on management judgment 
please refer to note a basis of presentation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a complete listing of our accounting policies 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined principally by the first in  first out fifo method 
in valuing inventory  we are required to make assumptions regarding the level of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or over valued items at the lower of cost or market 
the valuation of used equipment taken in trade from customers requires us to use the best information available to determine the value of the equipment to potential customers 
this value is subject to change based on numerous conditions 
inventory reserves are established taking into account age  frequency of use  or sale  and in the case of repair parts  the installed base of machines 
while calculations are made involving these factors  significant management judgment regarding expectations for future events is involved 
future events which could significantly influence our judgment and related estimates include general economic conditions in markets where our products are sold  new equipment price fluctuations  competitive actions  including the introduction of new products and technological advances  as well as new products and design changes we introduce 
at december   reserves for excess and obsolete inventory totaled million 
accounts receivable we are required to make judgments relative to our ability to collect accounts receivable from our customers 
valuation of receivables includes evaluating customer payment histories  customer leverage  availability of third party financing  political and exchange risks and other factors 
many of these factors  including the assessment of a customer s ability to pay  are influenced by economic and market factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 
at december   reserves for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable totaled million 
guarantees we have issued guarantees to financial institutions of customer financing to purchase equipment as of december  we must assess the probability of losses or non performance in ways similar to the evaluation of accounts receivable  including consideration of a customer s payment history  leverage  availability of third party finance  political and exchange risks and other factors 
many of these factors  including the assessment of a customer s ability to pay  are influenced by economic and market factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 
to date  losses related to guarantees have been negligible 
our customers  from time to time  may fund acquisition of our equipment through third party finance companies 
in certain instances  we may provide a credit guarantee to the finance company  by which we agree to make payments to the finance company should the customer default 
our maximum liability is limited to the remaining payments due to the finance company at the time of default 
in the event of customer default  we are generally able to recover and dispose of the equipment and realize the benefits of any net proceeds in excess of the remaining payments due to the finance company 
as of december   our maximum exposure to such credit guarantees was million  including total guarantees issued by terex demag  part of the cranes segment  and genie  part of the aerial work platforms segment  of million and million  respectively 
the terms of these guarantees coincide with the financing arranged by the customer and generally does not exceed five years 
given our position as the original equipment manufacturer and our knowledge of end markets  when called upon to fulfill a guarantee  we have generally been able to liquidate the financed equipment at a minimal loss  if any 
we issue residual value guarantees under sales type leases 
a residual value guarantee involves a guarantee that a piece of equipment will have a minimum fair market value at a future point in time 
as described in note s litigations and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  genie s maximum exposure related to residual value guarantees under sales type leases was million at december   with our total residual value guarantees issued including genie of million 
we are able to mitigate the risk associated with these guarantees because the maturity of the guarantees is staggered  which limits the amount of used equipment entering the marketplace at any one time 
we guarantee  from time to time  that we will buy equipment from our customers in the future at a stated price if certain conditions are met by the customer 
such guarantees are referred to as buyback guarantees 
these conditions generally pertain to the functionality and state of repair of the machine 
as of december   our maximum exposure pursuant to buyback guarantees was million 
we are able to mitigate the risk of these guarantees by staggering the timing of the buybacks and through leveraging our access to the used equipment markets provided by our original equipment manufacturer status 
we record a liability for the estimated fair value of guarantees issued pursuant to financial accounting standards board the fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards nos 
 and and rescission of fin we recognize a loss under a guarantee when our obligation to make payment under the guarantee is probable and the amount of the loss can be estimated 
a loss would be recognized if our payment obligation under the guarantee exceeds the value we can expect to recover to offset such payment  primarily through the sale of the equipment underlying the guarantee 
we have recorded an aggregate liability within other current liabilities and other non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet of approximately million for the estimated fair value of all guarantees provided as of december  revenue recognition revenue and costs are generally recorded when products are shipped and invoiced to either independently owned and operated dealers or to customers 
revenue generated in the united states is recognized when title and risk of loss pass from us to our customers  which occurs upon shipment when terms are fob shipping point which is customary and upon delivery when terms are fob destination 
we also have a policy requiring that certain criteria be met in order to recognize revenue  including satisfaction of the following requirements a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  c collectibility is reasonably assured  and d we have no significant obligations for future performance 
in the united states  we have the ability to enter into a security agreement and receive a security interest in the product by filing an appropriate uniform commercial code ucc financing statement 
however  a significant portion of our revenue is generated outside of the united states 
in many countries outside of the united states  as a matter of statutory law  a seller retains title to a product until payment is made 
the laws do not provide for a seller s retention of a security interest in goods in the same manner as established in the ucc 
in these countries  we retain title to goods delivered to a customer until the customer makes payment so that we can recover the goods in the event of customer default on payment 
in these circumstances  where we only retain title to secure our recovery in the event of customer default  we also have a policy  which requires meeting certain criteria in order to recognize revenue  including satisfaction of the following requirements a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  d collectibility is reasonably assured  e we have no significant obligations for future performance  and f we are not entitled to direct the disposition of the goods  cannot rescind the transaction  cannot prohibit the customer from moving  selling  or otherwise using the goods in the ordinary course of business and have no other rights of holding title that rest with a titleholder of property that is subject to a lien under the ucc 
in circumstances where the sales transaction requires acceptance by the customer for items such as testing on site  installation  trial period or performance criteria  revenue is not recognized unless the following criteria have been met a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  d collectibility is reasonably assured  and e the customer has given their acceptance  the time period for acceptance has elapsed or we have otherwise objectively demonstrated that the criteria specified in the acceptance provisions have been satisfied 
in addition to performance commitments  we analyze factors such as the reason for the purchase to determine if revenue should be recognized 
this analysis is done before the product is shipped and includes the evaluation of factors that may affect the conclusion related to the revenue recognition criteria as follows a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
in limited circumstances  certain new units may be invoiced prior to the time customers take physical possession 
revenue is recognized in such cases only when the customer has a fixed commitment to purchase the units  the units have been completed  tested and made available to the customer for pickup or delivery  and the customer has requested that we hold the units for pickup or delivery at a time specified by the customer 
in such cases  the units are invoiced under our customary billing terms  title to the units and risks of ownership pass to the customer upon invoicing  the units are segregated from our inventory and identified as belonging to the customer and we have no further obligations under the order 
revenue from sales type leases is recognized at the inception of the lease 
income from operating leases is recognized ratably over the term of the lease 
we routinely sell equipment subject to operating leases and the related lease payments 
if we do not retain a substantial risk of ownership in the equipment  the transaction is recorded as a sale 
if we do retain a substantial risk of ownership  the transaction is recorded as a borrowing  the operating lease payments are recognized as revenue over the term of the lease and the debt is amortized over a similar period 
goodwill goodwill represents the difference between the total purchase price paid in the acquisition of a business and the fair value of the assets  both tangible and intangible  and liabilities we acquired 
we review the value of our recorded goodwill annually  and more frequently as circumstances warrant  to determine if this value is potentially impaired 
the initial recognition of goodwill  as well as the annual review of the carrying value of goodwill  requires that we develop estimates of future business performance 
these estimates are used to derive expected cash flow and include assumptions regarding future sales levels  the impact of cost reduction programs  and the level of working capital needed to support a given business 
we rely on data developed by business segment management as well as macroeconomic data in making these calculations 
the estimate also includes a determination of the reporting units weighted average cost of capital 
the cost of capital is based on assumptions about interest rates as well as a risk adjusted rate of return required by our equity investors 
changes in these estimates can impact the present value of the expected cash flow that is used in determining the fair value of goodwill as well as the overall expected value of a given business 
impairment of long lived assets our policy is to assess the realizability of our long lived assets  including intangible assets  and to evaluate such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets or group of assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined to exist if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset s carrying value 
future cash flow projections include assumptions regarding future sales levels  the impact of cost reduction programs  and the level of working capital needed to support each business 
we rely on data developed by business segment management as well as macroeconomic data in making these calculations 
there are no assurances that future cash flow assumptions will be achieved 
the amount of any impairment then recognized would be calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
accrued warranties we record accruals for unasserted warranty claims based on our prior claim experience 
warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized 
however  adjustments to the initial warranty accrual are recorded if actual claim experience indicates that adjustments are necessary 
these warranty costs are based upon management s assessment of past claims and current experience 
however  actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated  as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty  including the performance of new products  models and technology  changes in weather conditions for product operation  different uses for products and other similar factors 
accrued product liability we record accruals for product liability claims based on our prior claim experience 
accruals for product liability claims are valued based upon our prior claims experience  including consideration of the jurisdiction  circumstances of the accident  type of loss or injury  identity of plaintiff  other potential responsible parties  analysis of outside legal counsel  analysis of internal product liability counsel and the experience of our director of product safety 
we provide accruals for estimated product liability experience on known claims 
we do not accrue for reported incidents until such time as a claim is made against us 
actual product liability costs could be different due to a number of variables such as the decisions of juries or judges 
pension benefits pension benefits represent financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements 
as of december   we maintained four qualified defined benefit pension plans and one nonqualified plan covering certain us employees 
the benefits for the qualified plan covering salaried employees are based primarily on years of service and employees qualifying compensation during the final years of employment 
participation in the plan for salaried employees was frozen on or before october  the benefits for the three qualified plans covering bargaining unit employees are based primarily on years of service and a flat dollar amount per year of service 
participation was frozen effective december  for one plan  february  for another plan  and will be frozen effective june  for the third plan 
for all four qualified plans  no participants will be credited with service following the effective dates of their freeze  except that participants are credited with post freeze service for purposes of determining vesting and retirement eligibility only 
it is our policy  generally  to fund the qualified us plans based on the minimum requirements of the employee retirement income security act of the nonqualified plan provides retirement benefits to certain senior executives of the company and is unfunded 
generally  the nonqualified plan provides a benefit based on average total compensation earned over a participant s final five years of employment and years of service reduced by benefits earned under any company retirement program excluding salary deferrals and matching contributions 
we maintain defined benefit plans in germany  france  china and the united kingdom uk for some of our subsidiaries 
the plans in germany  france and china are unfunded plans 
plan assets consist primarily of common stocks  bonds  and short term cash equivalent funds 
for the us plans  approximately of the assets are in equity securities and are in fixed income securities 
for the uk funded plans  approximately of the assets are in equity securities  are in fixed income securities and in real estate 
this allocation is reviewed periodically and updated to meet the long term goals of the plan 
the determination of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan obligations and their associated expenses requires the use of actuarial valuations to estimate the benefits that employees earn while working  as well as the present value of those benefits 
we use the services of independent actuaries to assist with these calculations 
inherent in these valuations are economic assumptions including expected returns on plan assets  discount rates at which liabilities may be settled  rates of increase of health care costs  rates of future compensation increases as well as employee demographic assumptions such as retirement patterns  mortality and turnover 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions used are recorded as unrecognized gains and losses 
unrecognized gains and losses that exceed percent of the greater of the plan s projected benefit obligations or the market related value of assets are amortized to earnings over the shorter of the estimated future service period of the plan participants or the period until any anticipated final plan settlements 
several key assumptions are used in actuarial models to calculate pension expense and liability amounts recorded in the financial statements 
we believe the three most significant variables in the models are expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate  and the expected rate of compensation increase 
the actuarial models also use assumptions for various other factors including employee turnover  retirement age and mortality  which are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect experience 
we believe the assumptions used in the actuarial calculations are reasonable and are within accepted practices in each of the respective geographic locations in which we operate 
the expected long term rates of return on pension plan assets were for us plans and for the us plans at december  these rates are determined annually by management based on a weighted average of current and historical market trends  historical portfolio performance and the portfolio mix of investments 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at december is used to measure the earnings effects for the subsequent year 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense income 
our strategy with regard to the investments in the pension plans is to earn a rate of return sufficient to match or exceed the long term growth of pension liabilities 
the expected rate of return of plan assets represents an estimate of long term returns on the investment portfolio 
while we examine performance and future expectations annually  we also view historic asset portfolios and performance over a long period of years 
in the short term  there may be fluctuations of positive and negative yields year over year  but over the long term  the actual return is expected to match the expected assumptions 
actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods  and therefore  generally affect the recognized pension expense or benefit and our pension obligation in future periods 
the discount rates for pension plan liabilities were for us plans and to for international plans at december  the discount rate enables us to estimate the present value of expected future cash flows on the measurement date 
the rate used reflects a rate of return on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments at the december measurement date 
the discount rate at december is used to measure the year end benefit obligations and the earnings effects on the subsequent year 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
the expected rates of compensation increase for our international pension plans were to at december  these estimated annual compensation increases are determined by management every year and are based on historical trends and market indices 
effective december   upon adoption of sfas  we have recorded the underfunded status on our balance sheet as a liability and the unrecognized prior service costs and actuarial gains losses as a reduction in stockholders equity on the consolidated balance sheet 
the change in assumptions from the previous year primarily increases in the discount rate offset by an update in mortality rates for the foreign plans  resulted in a net decrease in the projected benefit obligation of million 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of demographic  economic and other factors 
the market value of the plan assets can change significantly in a relatively short period of time 
additionally  the measurement of the plan benefit obligations is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as a result  if the equity market declines and or interest rates decrease  the plan estimated benefit obligations could increase  causing an increase in liability and a reduction in stockholders equity 
we expect that any future obligations under our plans that are not currently funded will be funded from future cash flows from operations 
if our contributions are insufficient to adequately fund the plans to cover our future obligations  or if the performance of the assets in our plans does not meet expectations  or if our assumptions are modified  contributions could be higher than expected  which would reduce the cash available for our business 
changes in us or foreign laws governing these plans could require additional contributions 
in addition  changes in generally accepted accounting principles in the united states could require the recording of additional liabilities and costs related to these plans 
the assumptions used in computing our net pension expense and projected benefit obligation have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a change in each of the assumptions below would have the following effects upon net pension expense and projected benefit obligation  respectively  as of and for the year ended december  increase decrease discount rate expected long term rate of return discount rate expected long term rate of return amounts in millions u 
s 
plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation foreign plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation income taxes we estimate income taxes based on enacted tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which represent future tax benefits or obligations of the company 
these deferred income tax balances arise from temporary differences due to differing treatment of certain items for accounting and income tax purposes 
we evaluate deferred tax assets each period to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character  amount and timing to result in the use of our deferred tax assets 
character refers to the type capital gain vs 
ordinary income as well as the source foreign vs 
domestic of the income we generate 
timing refers to the period in which future income is expected to be generated 
timing is important because some net operating losses nols expire if not used within an established statutory time frame 
based on these evaluations  we have determined that it is more likely than not that expected future us earnings will be sufficient to use certain of our us deferred tax assets 
during the fourth quarter of  we reviewed our ability to use these nols on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction and entity by entity basis 
in performing our analysis  we reviewed the past and anticipated future earnings for each foreign entity  and  where necessary  recorded a valuation allowance for all deferred tax assets which we believed were not more likely than not to be realized in the future 
judgments and estimates are required to determine tax expense and deferred tax valuation allowances and in assessing exposures related to tax matters 
tax returns are subject to audit and local taxing authorities could challenge tax filing positions we take 
our practice is to review tax filing positions by jurisdiction and to record provisions for probable tax liabilities  including interest and penalties  if applicable 
as our business has grown in size and complexity  so has our potential exposure to uncertain tax positions 
given the subjective nature of certain areas of tax law  the results of any audits of tax returns could have an adverse impact on our financial statements 
we believe that we record and disclose tax liabilities as appropriate and have reasonably estimated our income tax liabilities and recoverable tax assets

liquidity and capital resources our main sources of funding are cash generated from operations  loans from our bank credit facilities and funds raised in capital markets 
we believe that cash generated from our operations  together with access to our bank credit facilities and our cash on hand  provides adequate liquidity to meet our operating and debt service requirements 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  in addition  we had million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facilities at december  generating cash from operations depends primarily on our ability to earn net income through sales of our products and manage our investment in working capital 
we continue to focus on collecting receivables in a timely manner 
consistent with past practice  each quarter we sell receivables to various third party financial institutions through several pre arranged facilities 
during the fourth quarter of and  we sold  without recourse  accounts receivable approximating and of our fourth quarter revenue in and  respectively  to provide additional liquidity 
the discontinuance of these facilities could negatively affect our liquidity 
we are focused on increasing inventory turns by sharing  throughout the company  many of the best practices and lean manufacturing processes that several of our business units have implemented successfully 
we expect these initiatives to reduce the levels of raw materials and work in process needed to support the business and allow us to reduce our manufacturing lead times  thereby reducing our working capital requirements 
our ability to generate cash from operations is subject to numerous factors  including the following a substantial number of our customers fund their purchases through third party finance companies that extend credit based on credit worthiness of the customers and expected residual value of the equipment 
changes in either the customers credit profile or in used equipment values may impact the ability of customers to purchase equipment 
as our sales levels increase  the absolute amount of working capital needed to support our business may increase  with a corresponding reduction in cash generated by operations 
we insure and sell a portion of our accounts receivable to third party finance companies 
these third party finance companies are not obligated to purchase accounts receivable from us  and may choose to limit or discontinue further purchases from us at any time 
changes in customers credit worthiness  in the market for credit insurance or in the willingness of third party finance companies to purchase accounts receivable from us can impact our cash flow from operations 
we purchase material and services from our suppliers on terms extended based on our overall credit rating 
adverse changes in our credit rating may impact suppliers willingness to extend terms and in turn increase the cash requirements of our business 
sales of our products are subject to general economic conditions  weather  competition  foreign currency fluctuations  and other such factors that in many cases are outside our direct control 
for example  during periods of economic uncertainty  many of our customers have tended to delay purchasing decisions  which has had a negative impact on cash generated from operations 
we negotiate  when possible  advance payments from our customers for products with long lead times to help fund the substantial working capital investment in these projects 
traditionally  our customers peak buying periods have been in the first half of a calendar year  as a result of their need to have new equipment available for the spring  summer and fall construction seasons in the northern hemisphere 
therefore  historically  our sales have tended to be seasonal  with more than half of our sales typically being generated in the first two quarters of a calendar year 
however  in both and  first and second half sales were relatively equal 
for  we expect sales once again to be approximately equal in the first and second half of the year 
this changing trend in seasonality has occurred as we have diversified our product offerings and expanded the geographic reach of our products  making our sales less dependent solely on construction products and sales in the united states and europe 
for example  sales of mining products are less seasonal in nature  and increased sales by our materials processing mining group have moderated the overall seasonal nature of terex s business 
a number of other factors have also contributed to the recent change in seasonal patterns 
price increases that were instituted by certain of our businesses in and increasingly took effect in the second half of these years as the price increases worked through backlog 
also  high levels of backlog in a number of our segments led to longer wait times and deliveries being accepted later in the year than typical 
we expect sales in the first half of to be driven by the desire of many of our customers for delivery of new equipment from march through july in order to have such equipment available for the spring  summer and fall construction seasons in the northern hemisphere 
sales in the second half of are anticipated to reflect fulfillment of backlog orders in the cranes business  continued strength in aerial work platforms  particularly from overseas demand  and demand from mining customers for equipment that will be accepted later in the year 
as a result of our traditional seasonality  we have tended historically to use cash to fund our operations during the first half of a calendar year and generate cash from operations during the second half of the year 
as a result of the changing trend in sales in recent years  there has been an accompanying change in cash patterns as well 
in both and  we used cash to fund our operations in the first quarter of the year and generated cash in the remaining three quarters of the year 
we expect cash from operations in to be similar to the and pattern 
to help fund our traditional seasonal cash pattern  which required significant cash expenditures during the first half of the year  we have historically maintained significant cash balances and a revolving line of credit in addition to term borrowings from our bank group 
during and the first six months of  we maintained a bank credit facility the old credit agreement that originally provided for million of term debt maturing in july and a revolving credit facility of million that was available through july the facility also included provisions for an additional million of term borrowing on terms similar to the original term loan debt under the facility  of which we had utilized million of additional term borrowings 
on july   we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a new credit agreement the new credit agreement with the lenders party thereto the new lenders and credit suisse  as administrative and collateral agent 
the new credit agreement provides us with a revolving line of credit of million available through july  and term debt of million that will mature on july  the revolving line of credit consists of million of domestic revolving loans and million of multicurrency revolving loans 
the new credit agreement also provides for incremental loan commitments of up to million  which may be extended at the option of the new lenders  in the form of revolving credit loans  term loans or a combination of both 
our new credit agreement requires compliance with a number of covenants 
these covenants require us to meet certain financial tests  namely a to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio  as defined in the new credit agreement  not in excess of to on the last day of any fiscal quarter  and b to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the new credit agreement  of not less than to for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters 
the covenants also limit  in certain circumstances  our ability to take a variety of actions  including incur indebtedness  create or maintain liens on our property or assets  make investments  loans and advances  engage in acquisitions  mergers  consolidations and asset sales  and pay dividends and distributions  including share repurchases 
the new credit agreement also contains customary events of default 
we are currently in compliance with all financial covenants under the new credit agreement 
our future compliance with these financial covenants under the new credit agreement will depend on our ability to generate earnings and manage our assets effectively 
our bank credit facilities also have various non financial covenants  both requiring us to refrain from taking certain actions as described above and requiring us to take certain actions  such as keeping in good standing our corporate existence  maintaining insurance  and providing our bank lending group with financial information on a timely basis 
our future ability to provide our bank lending group with financial information on a timely basis will depend on our ability to file periodic reports with the sec in a timely manner 
furthermore  we and certain of our subsidiaries agreed to take certain actions to secure borrowings under the new credit agreement 
the security granted by the company under the new credit agreement is tied to our credit ratings 
if the credit ratings of our debt under the new credit agreement are lower than bb and ba by standard and poor s ratings service s p and moody s investors service  inc moody s  respectively  with no negative outlook the initial ratings threshold  then we are required to a pledge as collateral the capital stock of our material domestic subsidiaries and of the capital stock of certain of our material foreign subsidiaries the stock collateral and b provide a first priority security interest in  and mortgages on  substantially all of our domestic assets the non stock collateral 
if the credit ratings of our debt under the new credit agreement exceed the initial ratings threshold for a period of consecutive days  then we are no longer required to pledge the non stock collateral 
further  if the credit ratings of our debt under the new credit agreement are higher than bbb and baa by s p and moody s  respectively  with no negative outlook the investment grade threshold  for a period of consecutive days  then we also are no longer required to pledge the stock collateral 
these security triggers operate in both directions 
should we exceed the investment grade threshold  but subsequently decline in ratings below the investment grade threshold for a period longer than consecutive days  we would once again need to pledge the stock collateral 
similarly  if we exceed the initial ratings threshold and subsequently decline below the initial ratings threshold for a period longer than consecutive days  we would again need to grant security in the non stock collateral 
at the time the new credit agreement was executed  we were below the initial ratings threshold  and had to pledge as security the stock collateral and the non stock collateral 
currently  the credit ratings of our debt under the new credit agreement are bb from standard and poor s and ba from moody s  which is above the initial ratings threshold but below the investment grade threshold 
as a result  while we continue to pledge the stock collateral as security  we are not currently required to pledge the non stock collateral as security 
in connection with the new credit agreement  we terminated the old credit agreement and related agreements and documents 
we used the proceeds from million of term loans under the new credit agreement and cash on hand to pay in full all amounts outstanding under the old credit agreement at the date of termination 
the larger revolving line of credit available to us under the new credit agreement allows us to maintain a smaller cash balance than we have traditionally 
this  in turn  allowed us to use a significant amount of our cash balance to reduce our debt during and early on june   we completed the redemption of million principal amount of our million principal amount outstanding senior subordinated notes due the notes 
the total cash paid was million  and included a call premium of as set forth in the indenture for the notes plus accrued interest of per  principal amount at the redemption date 
we recorded pre tax charges of million in the second quarter of for the call premium and accelerated amortization of debt acquisition costs as a loss on early extinguishment of debt 
on august   we redeemed the remaining million outstanding principal amount of the notes 
the total cash paid was million  and included a call premium of as set forth in the indenture for the notes plus accrued interest of per  principal amount at the redemption date 
we recorded pre tax charges of million in the third quarter of for the call premium and accelerated amortization of debt acquisition costs as a loss on early extinguishment of debt 
on january   we redeemed the outstanding million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due the notes 
the total cash paid was million  and included a call premium of as set forth in the indenture for the notes plus accrued interest of per  principal amount at the redemption date 
we will record pre tax charges of million in the first quarter of for the call premium and accelerated amortization of debt acquisition costs as a loss on early extinguishment of debt 
the interest rates charged under our bank credit facilities are subject to adjustment based on our consolidated leverage ratio 
the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding portion of the revolving credit component under the new credit agreement was at december  the weighted average interest rate on the term loans under the new credit agreement at december  was 
during june  moody s improved its issuer rating for us from b to ba and s p improved its issuer rating for us from bb to bb 
in september  moody s improved its rating on our senior secured debt from ba to ba and its rating on our senior subordinated debt from b to b we have also positioned ourselves to be able to repurchase some of our outstanding stock as conditions warrant 
in december  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s outstanding common shares through june  we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining a balance between fixed and floating rate debt  including the use of interest rate derivatives 
over the long term  we believe this mix will produce lower interest cost than a purely fixed rate mix without substantially increasing risk 
we continue to review our alternatives to improve capital structure and to reduce debt service costs through a combination of debt refinancing  asset sales and the sale of non strategic businesses 
our ability to access the capital markets to raise funds  through the sale of equity or debt securities  is subject to various factors  some specific to us and others related to general economic and or financial market conditions 
these include results of operations  projected operating results for future periods and debt to equity leverage 
our ability to access the capital markets is also subject to our timely filing of periodic reports with the sec  and our failure to file certain periodic reports on a timely basis limits our ability to access capital markets using short form registration through may  in addition  the terms of our bank credit facility and senior subordinated notes restrict our ability to make further borrowings and to sell substantial portions of our assets 
cash flows vs 
cash provided by operations for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to cash provided by operations of million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operations is consistent with the increase in sales volume  and reflects the improvement in our financial performance 
cash used in investing activities in the year ended december  was million  as compared to cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to proceeds we received from the sale of our discontinued operations and other assets in  partially offset by cash used in the acquisitions of sichuan crane and halco  as well as higher capital expenditures incurred as we invested in our infrastructure and our management information system during we used cash for financing activities of million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily driven by the payment of long term debt and our former credit facility loans in  partially offset by increased stock option exercise activity and the new classification of excess tax benefits from stock based compensation 
contractual obligations the following table sets out our specified contractual obligations at december  payments due by year total committed thereafter long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total long term debt obligations include expected interest expense 
interest expense is calculated using fixed interest rates for indebtedness that has fixed rates and the implied forward rates as of december  for indebtedness that has floating interest rates 
additionally  at december   we had outstanding letters of credit that totaled million and had issued million in guarantees of customer financing to purchase equipment  million in residual value guarantees and million in buyback guarantees 
we maintain defined benefit pension plans for some of our operations in the united states and europe 
it is our policy to fund the pension plans at the minimum level required by applicable regulations 
in  we made cash contributions to the pension plans of million  and we estimate that our pension plan contributions will be approximately million in we participate in a joint venture arrangement with a european financial institution as described below in off balance sheet arrangements variable interest entities 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees our customers  from time to time  may fund the acquisition of our equipment through third party finance companies 
in certain instances  we may provide a credit guarantee to the finance company  by which we agree to make payments to the finance company should the customer default 
our maximum liability is limited to the remaining payments due to the finance company at the time of default 
in the event of customer default  we are generally able to recover and dispose of the equipment and realize the benefits of any net proceeds in excess of the remaining payments due to the finance company 
as of december   our maximum exposure to such credit guarantees was million  including total credit guarantees issued by terex demag  part of our cranes segment  and genie  part of our aerial work platforms segment  of million and million  respectively 
the terms of these guarantees coincide with the financing arranged by the customer and generally do not exceed five years 
given our position as the original equipment manufacturer and our knowledge of end markets  when called upon to fulfill a guarantee  we have generally been able to liquidate the financed equipment at a minimal loss  if any 
we issue  from time to time  residual value guarantees under sales type leases 
a residual value guarantee involves a guarantee that a piece of equipment will have a minimum fair market value at a future point in time 
as described in note s litigation and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  our maximum exposure related to residual value guarantees under sales type leases was million at december  we are able to mitigate the risk associated with these guarantees because the maturity of the guarantees is staggered  which limits the amount of used equipment entering the marketplace at any one time 
we guarantee  from time to time  that we will buy equipment from our customers in the future at a stated price if certain conditions are met by the customer 
such guarantees are referred to as buyback guarantees 
these conditions generally pertain to the functionality and state of repair of the machine 
as of december   our maximum exposure pursuant to buyback guarantees was million 
we are able to mitigate the risk of these guarantees by staggering the timing of the buybacks and through leveraging our access to the used equipment markets provided by our original equipment manufacturer status 
we have recorded an aggregate liability within other current liabilities and other non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet of approximately million for the estimated fair value of all guarantees provided as of december  variable interest entities we own a forty percent interest in the tfsh joint venture 
a european financial institution owns the majority sixty percent interest in tfsh 
as defined by fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 tfsh is a variable interest entity 
based on the legal  financial and operating structure of tfsh  we have concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary of tfsh and that we do not control the operations of tfsh 
accordingly  we do not consolidate the results of tfsh into our consolidated financial statements 
we apply the equity method of accounting for our investment in tfsh 
the scope of tfsh s operations includes the opportunity to facilitate the financing of our products sold in certain areas of europe 
as of december   tfsh had total assets of million  consisting primarily of financing receivables and lease related equipment  and total liabilities of million  consisting primarily of debt issued by our joint venture partner 
prior to march   we provided guarantees related to potential losses arising from shortfalls in the residual values of financed equipment or credit defaults by the joint venture s customers 
as of december   the maximum exposure to loss under these guarantees was million 
additionally  we are required to maintain a capital account balance in tfsh  pursuant to the terms of the joint venture  which could result in our reimbursement to tfsh of losses to the extent of our ownership percentage 
because of the capital account balance requirements for tfsh  during the first quarter of  we contributed our proportional share of these requirements  which represented an additional million in cash to tfsh 
sale leaseback transactions our rental business typically rents equipment to customers for periods of no less than three months 
to better match cash outflows in the rental business to cash inflows from customers  we finance the equipment through a series of sale leasebacks  which are classified as operating leases 
the leaseback period is typically months in duration 
at december   the historical cost of equipment being leased back from the financing companies was approximately million and the minimum lease payment in will be approximately million 
contingencies and uncertainties foreign currencies and interest rate risk our products are sold in over countries around the world and  accordingly  our revenues are generated in foreign currencies  while the costs associated with those revenues are only partly incurred in the same currencies 
the major foreign currencies  among others  in which we do business are the euro and british pound 
we may  from time to time  hedge specifically identified committed cash flows or forecasted cash flows in foreign currencies using forward currency sale or purchase contracts 
at december   we had foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of million 
we manage exposure to interest rates by incurring a mix of indebtedness bearing interest at both floating and fixed rates at inception and maintaining an on going balance between floating and fixed rates on this mix of indebtedness through the use of interest rate swaps when necessary 
certain of our obligations  including our senior subordinated notes  bear interest at a fixed interest rate 
we entered into an interest rate agreement to convert a fixed rate to a floating rate with respect to million of the principal amount of our indebtedness under our senior subordinated notes 
the floating rate is based on a spread of over libor 
at december   the floating rate was 
to maintain an appropriate balance between floating and fixed rate obligations on our mix of debt  we exited this interest rate swap agreement on january  and paid million 
this loss will be recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged debt and will be amortized through the debt maturity date 
other we are subject to a number of contingencies and uncertainties including  without limitation  product liability claims  self insurance obligations  tax examinations and guarantees 
many of the exposures are unasserted or proceedings are at a preliminary stage  and it is not presently possible to estimate the amount or timing of any of our costs 
however  we do not believe that these contingencies and uncertainties will  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on us 
when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and possible to make reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to such matters  a provision is recorded for the amount of such estimate or for the minimum amount of a range of estimates when it is not possible to estimate the amount within the range that is most likely to occur 
we generate hazardous and non hazardous wastes in the normal course of our manufacturing operations 
as a result  we are subject to a wide range of federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations govern actions that may have adverse environmental effects  such as discharges to air and water  and also require compliance with certain practices when handling and disposing of hazardous and non hazardous wastes 
these laws and regulations also impose liability for the costs of  and damages resulting from  cleaning up sites  past spills  disposals and other releases of hazardous substances  should any of such events occur 
no such incidents have occurred which required us to pay material amounts to comply with such laws and regulations 
compliance with such laws and regulations has required  and will continue to require  us to make expenditures 
we do not expect that these expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our business or profitability 
transactions with former employees on november   we entered into an agreement with filver sa filver  an entity affiliated with fil filipov  the president of our cranes segment until his retirement effective january  pursuant to this agreement  filver provided consulting services to us as assigned by our chief executive officer 
the term of the agreement was for three years commencing january   with an initial base consulting fee of million per year  subject to adjustment based on usage of filver s services and filver s performance determined at our discretion  plus reimbursement of certain expenses 
the terms of the agreement between filver and us were similar to terms that we believe would have been agreed upon in an arm s length transaction

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks that exist as part of our ongoing business operations and we use derivative financial instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
as a matter of policy  we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions 
see note m derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for further information on accounting policies related to derivative financial instruments 
foreign exchange risk we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases and sales  intercompany product shipments and intercompany loans 
we are also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments 
additionally  we are exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars 
primary exposures include the us dollar versus functional currencies of our major markets  which include the euro and british pound 
we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and identify naturally offsetting positions and purchase hedging instruments to protect anticipated exposures 
at december   we had foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of approximately million 
the fair market value of these arrangements  which represents the cost to settle these contracts  was a net gain of million at december  interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing issuances of variable rate debt 
primary exposure includes movements in the us prime rate and libor 
we manage interest rate risk by incurring a mix of indebtedness bearing interest at both floating and fixed rates at inception and maintain an on going balance between floating and fixed rates on this mix of indebtedness through the use of interest rate swaps when necessary 
at december   approximately of our debt was floating rate debt and the weighted average interest rate for all debt was 
at december   we had a million interest rate swap that converted a fixed rate to a floating rate 
the floating rate was at december  the fair market value of this arrangement  which represents the cost to settle this contract  was a net loss of million at december  to maintain an appropriate balance between floating and fixed rate obligations on our mix of debt  we exited this interest rate swap agreement on january  and paid million 
this loss will be recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged debt and will be amortized through the debt maturity date 
on march  and august   we exited interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of million and million  respectively  in order to maintain an appropriate balance between floating and fixed rates on its mix of indebtedness 
as a result of these transactions  we recorded a gain of approximately in interest expense 
at december   we performed a sensitivity analysis for our derivatives and other financial instruments that have interest rate risk 
we calculated the pretax earnings effect on our interest sensitive instruments 
based on this sensitivity analysis  we have determined that an increase of in our average floating interest rates at december  would have increased interest expense by approximately million in commodities risk principal materials that we use in our various manufacturing processes include steel  castings  engines  tires  hydraulic cylinders  drive trains  electric controls and motors  and a variety of other commodities and fabricated or manufactured items 
our performance may be impacted by extreme movements in material costs and from availability of these materials 
as our manufacturing volume has increased  our need for these commodities and manufactured items also has increased  which in turn has created pressure on our existing supplier base to deliver us materials on a timely basis and in sufficient amounts when requested 
this supply constraint has been exacerbated as a result of higher global demand for the same materials caused by recovering end markets in our product areas and by higher consumption from emerging economies such as china 
the inability of suppliers to deliver materials promptly has resulted  and could result  in production delays and increased costs to manufacture our products 
some of the necessary components for which we have experienced supply constraints over the recent past include large off highway tires  steel and steel products  bearings  gear boxes and various fabricated weldments 
furthermore  as demand for these materials has increased  we have experienced increased costs to obtain these components 
in the absence of labor strikes or other unusual circumstances  substantially all materials are normally available from multiple suppliers 
current and potential suppliers are evaluated on a regular basis on their ability to meet our requirements and standards 
we actively manage our material supply sourcing  and may employ various methods to limit risk associated with commodity cost fluctuations and availability 
to deal with some of the recent supply constraints we have experienced  for example  we designed and implemented plans to mitigate their impact by using alternate suppliers  leveraging our overall purchasing volumes to obtain favorable quantities and costs  and increasing the price of our products 
we continue to search for acceptable alternative supply sources and less expensive supply options on a regular basis 
one key terex business system initiative has been developing and implementing world class capability in supply chain management  logistics and global purchasing 
we are focusing on gaining efficiencies with suppliers based on our global purchasing power and resources
