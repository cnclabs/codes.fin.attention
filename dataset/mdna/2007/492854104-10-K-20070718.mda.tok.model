we cannot always predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements 
in addition  readers are urged to consider statements that include the terms believes  belief  expects  plans  objectives  anticipates  intends  or the like to be uncertain and forward looking 
over time  our actual results  performance or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results  performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward looking statements  and such difference might be significant and harmful to our stockholders interest 
many important factors that could cause such a difference are described under the caption risk factors  in item a of this annual report  which you should review carefully 
management s discussion and analysis introduction we are a recognized leader in the design  manufacture  and installation of laboratory and technical furniture products 
laboratory furniture products include both steel and wood cabinetry  fume hoods  flexible systems  and worksurfaces 
technical furniture products include workstations  workbenches  computer enclosures  and network storage systems 
our headquarters and manufacturing facilities are located in statesville  north carolina 
we also have subsidiaries in singapore and bangalore  india that serve the asian and middle east markets 
although only approximately of our sales were through our international subsidiaries in fiscal year these sales are considered an important part of our long term growth strategy 
our products are primarily sold through purchase orders and contracts submitted by customers through our dealers and commissioned agents  a national distributor  and through competitive bids submitted by us and our subsidiaries 
products are sold principally to pharmaceutical  biotechnology  industrial  chemical and commercial research laboratories  educational institutions  healthcare institutions  governmental entities  manufacturing facilities  and users of networking furniture 
we consider the markets in which we compete to be highly competitive  with a significant amount of the business involving competitive public bidding 
it is common in the laboratory furniture industry for customer orders to require delivery at extended future dates  as products are frequently to be installed in buildings yet to be constructed 
changes or delays in building construction may cause delays in delivery of the orders and our recognition of the sale 
since prices are normally quoted on a firm basis in the industry  we bear the burden of possible increases in labor and material costs between receipt of an order and delivery of the product 
the impact of such possible increases is considered when determining the sales price 
the principal raw materials and products manufactured by others used in our products are cold rolled carbon and stainless steel  hardwood lumbers and plywood  paint  chemicals  resins  hardware  plumbing and electrical fittings 
such materials and products are purchased from multiple suppliers and are typically readily available 
critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents revenue recognition a portion of our product sales result from fixed price construction contracts that involve a signed contract for a fixed price to provide our laboratory furniture and fume hoods for a construction project 
we are usually in the role of a subcontractor  but in some cases may enter into a contract directly with the end user of the products 
product sales resulting from fixed price construction contracts are generated from multiple element arrangements that require separate units of accounting and estimates regarding the fair value of individual elements 
our multiple element arrangements that qualify as separate units of accounting are product sales and installation services 
each of these elements represent individual units of accounting as the delivered item has value to a customer on a stand alone basis  objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for undelivered items  and arrangements normally do not contain a general right of return relative to the delivered item 
we determine fair value based on the price of the deliverable when it is sold separately or based on third party evidence 
in accordance with the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we use the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration when the arrangement does not indicate fair value of the product sale 
under the residual method  the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered item equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items 
assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met  we recognize revenue for product sales at the date of shipment 
product sales resulting from purchase orders involve a purchase order received by us from our dealers or our stocking distributor 
this category includes product sales for standard products  as well as products which require some customization 
these sales are recognized under the terms of the purchase order which generally are freight on board fob shipping point and do not include rights of return 
accordingly  sales are recognized at the time of shipment 
allowance for doubtful accounts evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts involves management judgments and estimates 
we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors 
in circumstances where management is aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  or a project dispute makes it unlikely that all of the receivable owed by a customer will be collected  a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded  to reduce the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  a general reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of the majority of inventories is measured on the last in  first out lifo method 
the lifo method allocates the most recent costs to cost of products sold  and  therefore  recognizes into operating results fluctuations in raw materials  and other inventoriable costs more quickly than other methods 
other inventories consisted of foreign inventories and are measured at actual cost 
pension benefits we sponsor pension plans covering all employees who met eligibility requirements as of april  in february  our pension plans were amended as of april  no further benefits have been  or will be  earned under the plans subsequent to the amendment date  and no additional participants have been  or will be  added to the plans 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the pension plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate used to calculate and determine benefit obligations and expected return on plan assets within certain guidelines 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may significantly affect the amount of pension income or expense recorded by us in future periods 
results of operations sales for fiscal year were million  a decrease of from fiscal year sales of million 
domestic operations sales for the year were million  a decrease of from the prior year 
as reflected in the growth of our order backlog  the domestic marketplace for laboratory products continued to be healthy during the year  particularly for larger laboratory products 
however  the marketplace for small and mid sized projects remained subdued and very price competitive 
international operations sales for the year were million  an increase of over the prior year 
international operations sales for the year benefited from a strengthening of our sales representation in the asian and middle east markets and a further expansion of our manufacturing capabilities in india 

table of contents our order backlog was million at april   as compared to million at april   and million at april  the increase in order backlog in fiscal year was due to the strong volume of incoming orders  both domestic and international  in the second half of the year 
sales for fiscal year were million  an increase of from fiscal year sales of million 
domestic operations sales for the year were million  an increase of over the prior year 
domestic selling prices declined during fiscal year  as manufacturers reacted to excess manufacturing capacity in the marketplace 
international operations sales for fiscal year were million  an increase of over the prior year 
gross profit represented   and of sales in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increase in the gross profit margin in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily due to improved manufacturing costs  continuing success in identifying new lower cost global supply sources for raw materials and components  and other cost improvement activities 
the decrease in gross profit margin in fiscal year from fiscal year was due to a number of unfavorable factors 
these included lower selling prices  increased costs of raw materials  particularly steel and epoxy resin  and increased costs of energy and transportation 
we only had limited success in our efforts to pass on these added costs to customers 
the unfavorable factors were partially offset by actions taken to reduce factory overhead  manufacturing costs  and material costs 
other operating income of  in fiscal year resulted from the sale of our former plant site in lockhart  texas 
operating expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively  and   and of sales  respectively 
the decrease in operating expenses for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a reduction in sales and marketing expenses of  and a decline of  in sales commission due to lower sales 
the decrease in operating expenses for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily attributable to cost reduction activities during fiscal year  the full benefit of workforce reductions made during the prior year  a decrease in pension expense of  resulting from the freezing of benefits in our pension plans as of april   and a reduction in bad debt expense of  other income was   and  in fiscal years   and  respectively 
interest expense was   and  in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increased interest expense in fiscal year resulted primarily from higher interest rates paid and higher levels of bank borrowings and capital leases during the year 
the increased interest expense in fiscal year resulted primarily from higher interest rates paid 
income tax expense of  or of pretax earnings  was recorded in fiscal year the effective tax rate for fiscal year differs from the statutory rate as it was increased by the impact of differing foreign tax rates and was decreased by the impact of state and federal tax credits 
income tax expense of  or of pretax earnings  was recorded in fiscal year the impact of earned state and federal tax credits in fiscal year was offset by a valuation allowance established against earned but unused tax credits 
an income tax benefit of  or of the pretax loss  was recorded in fiscal year the effective rate for fiscal year differs from the statutory rate due to the impact of state and federal tax credits 
the effective rate for fiscal year was also impacted by the level of the pretax losses 
minority interest related to our two subsidiaries that are not owned by us were   and  for fiscal years   and  respectively

net earnings in fiscal year were  or per diluted share 
net earnings in fiscal year were  or per diluted share 
net earnings in fiscal year included a gain of  resulting from the sale of our former plant site in lockhart  texas 
a net loss of  or per diluted share  was reported for fiscal year 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have historically been funds generated from operating activities  supplemented as needed by borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
additionally  certain machinery and equipment are financed by non cancelable operating leases or capital leases 
we believe that these sources of funds will be sufficient to support ongoing business requirements  including capital expenditures  through fiscal year at april   we had advances of million outstanding under an unsecured million revolving credit facility 
the credit facility matures in december  and we intend to extend or replace it with a new facility prior to the maturity date  although there can be no assurance as to the availability or terms of any such extension or replacement 
during fiscal year  we entered into a year operating lease for a new distribution center in statesville  north carolina 
this lease arrangement  as well as most of our leases for machinery and equipment  provides us with renewal and purchase options and certain early cancellation rights 
in fiscal year  we began a project to purchase and install a new enterprise resource planning erp system 
the project is projected to have a total cost of million and is expected to be completed in fiscal year we have entered into lease arrangements to fund the majority of the external costs of the project as costs are incurred 
costs of   and  for the project were incurred and funded under operating and capital lease arrangements during fiscal years  and  respectively 
the following table summarizes the obligated cash payments including interest  if applicable  for the above commitments as of april  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total year years years after years operating leases capital leases total contractual cash obligations we do not have any off balance sheet obligations at april  operating activities provided cash of million in fiscal year  primarily from operating earnings  a reduction in accounts receivable  and an increase in deferred revenue 
operating activities used cash of  in fiscal year and provided cash of million in fiscal year the primary uses of cash during fiscal year were increases in inventory and accounts receivable balances  partially offset by cash provided from operating earnings and an increase in accounts payable 
operations  along with a reduction in accounts receivable  were the primary sources of cash in fiscal year the majority of the april  accounts receivable balances are expected to be collected during the first quarter of fiscal year  with the exception of retention amounts on fixed price contracts which are collected when the entire construction project is completed and all retention funds are paid by the owner 
as discussed above  no further benefits have been  or will be  earned under our pension plans after april   and no additional participants have been  or will be  added to the plans 
we did not make any contributions to the plans in fiscal years and  and do not expect to make any contributions to the plans in fiscal year capital expenditures were million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively

recent accounting standards adoption of sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
in september  the sec staff released staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
traditionally  there have been two widely recognized methods of quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements the roll over method and the iron curtain method 
the roll over method focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement  including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements  but its use can lead to the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet 
the iron curtain method focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the income statement 
in sab  the sec staff established an approach that required quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effect of the misstatements on each of a company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this model is commonly referred to as a dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the iron curtain and the roll over methods 
sab permits public companies to initially apply its provisions either by i restating prior financial statements as if the dual approach had always been used or ii recording the cumulative effect of initially applying the dual approach as adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of may  with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
during fiscal years through the company overstated deferred income tax assets by a cumulative total amount of  subsequent to the years in which the overstatements occurred  the company discovered the errors and determined they were not material to the company s financial statements for the years in which they occurred 
the company elected to apply sab to correct the errors using the cumulative effect transition method 
the following table summarizes the effects on the related account balances of applying the guidance in sab as of may  origination period of misstatement in thousands adjustment years ended april at may  and prior decrease in deferred income tax assets decrease in net income decrease in retained earnings new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin or the interpretation which defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority 
uncertainty in income taxes  as used in the title of the new interpretation  refers to uncertainty about how some transactions will be treated under the tax law 
this uncertainty leads to questions about whether tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns should be reflected in the financial statements before they are finally resolved with the taxing authorities 
fin applies to all tax 
table of contents positions  regardless of their level of uncertainty or the nature of the position 
however  the interpretation s recognition and measurement requirements are likely to have the most impact on positions for which current or future deductions may be disallowed or reduced in a tax examination 
the interpretation applies to situations where the uncertainty is about the timing of the deduction  the amount of the deduction  or the validity of the deduction 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and the company will adopt this interpretation during the first quarter of fiscal year the company has not yet determined the effect  if any  that the adoption of fin will have on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurement sfas  which establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value  sets out a framework for measuring fair value  and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements in both annual and interim reports 
sfas applies only to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards and is expected to increase the consistency of those measurements 
sfas is effective for fair value measures already required or permitted by other standards for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and will be effective for the company in fiscal year the company has not yet determined the effect  if any  that the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas  which requires employers to recognize on their balance sheets the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
sfas also requires companies to recognize actuarial gains and losses  prior service cost  and any remaining transition amounts from the initial application of statements and when recognizing a plan s funded status  with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive income 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  and the company has adopted this standard effective april  adoption of this standard resulted in a million decrease in other non current assets  a million decrease in other comprehensive income  a million decrease in deferred tax liabilities  and a  increase in deferred tax assets 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  which allows measurement of specified financial instruments  warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in each period 
sfas is effective at the beginning of the fiscal year that begins after november   and will be effective for the company in fiscal year the company has not yet determined the effect  if any  that the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
sarbanes oxley section requirements on may   the us securities and exchange commission further extended the compliance dates for non accelerated filers to include in their annual reports a report by management on our internal control over financial reporting and an accompanying auditor s report 
as a result  we must comply with this requirement for our year ending april  outlook while our ability to predict future demand for our products continues to be limited given  among other general economic factors affecting the company and our markets  the company s role as subcontractor or supplier to dealers for subcontractors  we expect fiscal year to be profitable 
in addition to general economic factors affecting the company and our markets  demand for our products is also dependent upon the number of laboratory construction projects planned and or current progress in projects already under construction 
our earnings are also impacted by increased costs of raw materials  including stainless steel  wood  and epoxy resin  and whether we are able to increase product prices to customers in amounts that correspond to such increases without materially and adversely affecting sales 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in the area of interest rates 
this exposure is associated with amounts outstanding under our bank note  certain lease obligations for production machinery  and advances under our revolving credit loan  all of which are priced on a floating rate basis 
the principal balance under the revolving credit loan was million at april  we believe that this exposure to market risk is not material
