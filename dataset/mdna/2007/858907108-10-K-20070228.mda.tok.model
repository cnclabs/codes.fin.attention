for a more complete understanding of trends  events  commitments  liquidity  capital resources and critical accounting estimates  you should carefully read this entire report 
our success is highly dependent on economic conditions and market interest rates 
because we operate in the houston  dallas and san antonio metropolitan areas  the local economic conditions in each of these areas are particularly important 
all three of these local economies grew at a steady pace in each economy added jobs at a faster pace than the overall us economy 
the overall economic outlook for houston  dallas  and san antonio remains favorable  as local economists are forecasting continued job growth in with the help of a solid texas economy we reported strong earnings growth in despite operating in a competitive market and difficult interest rate environment 
we realize income primarily from the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
each of these financial instruments reacts differently to changes in interest rates 
beginning june to december   the federal reserve board increased overnight interest rates by basis points to 
in contrast  the movement of long term and short term rates have produced a flatter interest rate yield curve 
more recently  the yield curve has even inverted at certain maturities 
while we are impacted significantly by the size and timing of short term rate increases  as well as the shape of the yield curve and other competitive factors  our balance sheet is generally positioned to benefit from a gradually rising interest rate environment 
because of our double digit growth in loans and deposits and our relatively high percentage of non interest bearing deposits to total funding we were able to expand our net interest margin for the full year despite the additional pressure from the interest rate yield curve 
additionally during  we experienced significant improvements in our asset quality as reflected in the decreases in both nonperforming loans and net charge offs 

table of contents 
index to financial statements during the year  we strengthened our management team by adding several key executives as well as redeploying members of the current management team into new roles 
these changes position sterling to better focus on the automating and streamlining of various processes  expanding product lines and increasing our share in the markets we serve 
in  our earnings per share increased compared to additionally  during our overall average earning assets grew by and our average deposits grew by 
we continue to look for fairly priced strategic acquisitions in houston  san antonio and dallas 
on january   the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire partners bank of texas partners bank 
the merger is subject to customary closing conditions including receipt of regulatory approval and is expected to occur in the first or second quarter of the consideration of the merger is a combination of stock and cash totaling approximately million for all of partners bank s issued and outstanding shares of common stock 
the merger agreement has been approved by the respective boards of directors of the company and partners bank  and the transactions contemplated are subject to the approval of the partners bank s shareholders

critical accounting policies an understanding of our accounting policies is important to an understanding of our reported results 
accounting policies are described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
certain of our accounting policies are considered to be critical because they involve subjective judgment  estimation by management or are particularly complex in their nature 
allowance for credit losses 
the allowance for credit losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses incurred on loans and binding commitments 
losses are charged to the allowance when the loss actually occurs or when a determination is made that a probable loss has occurred 
recoveries are credited to the allowance at the time of recovery 
throughout the year  management estimates the probable level of losses to determine whether the allowance for credit losses is adequate to absorb losses in the existing portfolio 
based on these estimates  an amount is charged to the provision for credit losses and credited to the allowance for credit losses in order to adjust the allowance to a level determined to be adequate to absorb losses 
management s judgment as to the level of probable losses on existing loans involves the consideration of current economic conditions and their estimated effects on specific borrowers  an evaluation of the existing relationships among loans  potential credit losses and the present level of the allowance  results of examinations of the loan portfolio by regulatory agencies  and management s internal review of the loan portfolio 
in determining the collectibility of certain loans  management also considers the fair value of any underlying collateral 
the amount ultimately realized may differ from the carrying value of these assets because of economic  operating or other conditions beyond our control 
please refer to the subsequent discussion of allowance for credit losses below as well as in note to the consolidated financial statements for additional insight into management s approach and methodology in estimating the allowance for credit losses 
goodwill and other intangibles 
goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to an annual evaluation of whether any impairment has occurred 
if any such impairment is determined to have occurred  a writedown would be recorded 
intangible assets consist primarily of core deposits and customer relationships 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized on an accelerated basis over the years 
table of contents 
index to financial statements expected to be benefited  which we believe is approximately years 
based on our annual goodwill impairment test as of december   management does not believe any of our goodwill is impaired as of december  while we believe no impairment existed at december  under accounting standards applicable at that date  different conditions or assumptions  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of our impairment evaluation and financial condition or future results of operations 
derivatives 
we may designate a derivative as either an accounting hedge of the fair value of a recognized fixed rate asset or an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge or an accounting hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of future cash flows of a floating rate asset or liability cash flow hedge 
all derivatives are recorded as other assets or other liabilities on the balance sheet at their respective fair values 
to the extent of the effectiveness of a hedge  changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income  net of income taxes 
for all hedge relationships  ineffectiveness resulting from differences between the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item and changes in fair value of the derivative are recognized as other income in the results of operations 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment revised 
sfas r applies to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after january  sfas r eliminated the ability to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value based method of accounting  and requires that such transactions be recognized as compensation cost in the income statement based on their fair values on the date of the grant 
the grant date fair value of options is determined using option pricing models based on subjective assumptions which materially affect the fair value estimate 
compensation expense for restricted stock awards is based on the market price of the stock on the date of grant and is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the award 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
disclosures of stock based compensation are also included in note to the consolidated financial statements

net interest income is our principal source of earnings 
interest rate fluctuations  as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and liabilities  combine to affect net interest income 
the federal reserve board significantly influences market interest rates  including rates offered for loans and deposits by many financial institutions 
generally  when the federal reserve board changes the target overnight interest rate charged by banks  the market responds with a similar change in the prime lending rate

at december   the market yield on year us treasury notes was compared with at december  and at december  this has resulted in a general flattening of the interest rate yield curve

these securities are tied to an underlying government guaranteed loan and are subject to prepayment and interest rate fluctuations 
these securities had been in an unrealized loss position since the fourth quarter of given the current prepayment factors for the underlying loan and management s inability to determine when a full recovery of the value may occur  management considered these securities to be other than temporarily impaired 
these losses were offset by a thousand realized gain on investments which were sold subsequent to the acquisition of both and as part of our routine portfolio management

our nonperforming and past due loans are substantially collateralized by assets  with any excess of loan balances over collateral values specifically allocated in the allowance for loan losses 
on an ongoing basis  we receive updated appraisals on loans secured by real estate  particularly those categorized as nonperforming loans and potential problem loans 
in those instances where updated appraisals reflect reduced collateral values  an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition is made to determine the need  if any  for possible write downs or appropriate additions to the allowance for loan losses 
potential problem loans are those loans not classified as nonperforming  but where information known by management indicates serious doubt that the borrower will be able to comply with the present payment terms

the allowance for credit losses and the related provision for credit losses are determined based on the historical credit loss experience  changes in the loan portfolio  including size  mix and risk of the individual loans  and current economic conditions 
we monitor economic conditions in our local market areas and the probable impact on borrowers  on past due amounts  on related collateral values  on the number and size of the non performing loans and on the resulting amount of charges offs for the period 
the provision for credit losses for was million as compared to million for the lower provision for credit losses during was due to a favorable improvement in net charge offs during the year and is reflective of the general improvement in our asset quality that has been a function of both a healthy texas economy and a strengthening in our credit culture 
we incurred net charge offs of million or of average loans for compared to million or of average loans during net charge offs decreased million during as compared to these improvements in asset quality are primarily attributable to several internal changes during the past year 
some of these changes include implementing a consumer and micro business loan credit scoring system  updating and revising our loan policy  standardizing our loan funding process  improving our loan approval process and enhancing our credit culture to take a more value added risk management approach 
during  we will introduce a system that will measure probability of default  loss given default and expected losses on all loan assets 
this will continue to improve the credit

index to financial statements quality of the bank s portfolio by eliminating those potential loans that are less desirable from a credit risk perspective 
the allowance for credit losses is a valuation reserve consisting of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments 
it is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses 
based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio  management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses to the bank s board of directors  indicating any changes in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance 
in making our evaluation  we consider the industry diversification of the commercial loan portfolio and the effect of changes in the local real estate market on collateral values 
we also consider the results of recent regulatory examinations  our history of credit experience and our ongoing internal credit reviews 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was million and represented of total loans 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was of nonperforming loans  up from at december  the reserve for unfunded lending commitments was thousand at december  as compared with million at december  we continually monitor economic conditions in our local market areas and the probable impact on borrowers  past due amounts  related collateral values  the number and size of non performing loans and on the resulting amount of charge offs for the period 
we have several systems and procedures in place to assist in managing the overall quality of the loan portfolio 
in addition to established underwriting guidelines and approval processes  we monitor delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends 
we also perform reviews of the loan portfolios on a regular basis to identify troubled loans and to assess their overall probability of collection 
ongoing portfolio reviews are conducted by our internal loan review department under an established loan review program 
we are targeting a loan review penetration of at least annually of the total commercial and real estate loan portfolios 
through the loan review process  we maintain an internally classified loan list  which  along with the delinquency list of loans  helps us assess the overall quality of the loan portfolios and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
loans on this listing are classified as substandard  doubtful or loss based on probability of repayment  collateral valuation and related collectibility 
all doubtful and loss loans are considered impaired 
substandard loans are defined as impaired when based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due  both interest and principal  according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans is determined based on the difference between the carrying value of the impaired loan and its fair value 
the fair value is determined based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
loans classified as substandard have clear and defined weaknesses such as highly leveraged positions  unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition  which may jeopardize the loan s recoverability 
loans classified as doubtful have characteristics similar to substandard loans but with an increased risk that a loss may occur or that at least a portion of the loan may require a charge off if liquidated at present 
although loans classified as substandard do not duplicate loans classified as doubtful  both substandard and doubtful loans include some loans that are delinquent at least days or on nonaccrual status 
loans classified as loss are those loans that are in the process of being charged off 

table of contents 
index to financial statements at december   substandard loans totaled million  of which million were loans designated as delinquent or nonaccrual  and doubtful loans totaled million all of which were designated as delinquent or nonaccrual 
in addition to the internally classified loan list and delinquency list of loans  we maintain a separate watch list which further aids in monitoring the loan portfolios 
watch list loans show warning elements  deficiencies that require attention in the short run  or where pertinent ratios of the loan account have weakened to a point where more frequent monitoring is warranted 
these loans do not have all the characteristics of a classified loan substandard or doubtful but do show weakened elements as compared with those of a satisfactory credit 
we review these loans in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
as of december  and  watch list loans totaled million and million  respectively 
management assigns loan grades by individual loan and allocations are made within each loan grade 
loans are assigned a grade according to payment history  collateral values  and financial condition of the borrower 
the bank maintains an adequate allowance for credit losses through its watchlist classifications  allocating an increasing reserve amount as the severity of a problem loan increases 
the bank maintains an unallocated reserve for satisfactory non classified credits based  in part  on the average of the last three year s actual net charge offs

an interest sensitive asset or liability is one that experiences changes in cashflows as a direct result of changes in market interest rates 
we manage interest rate risk by positioning the balance sheet to maximize net interest income while maintaining an acceptable level of risk  remaining mindful of the relationship between profitability  liquidity and interest rate risk 
the overall interest rate risk position and strategies for the management of interest rate risk are reviewed by senior management  the asset liability management committee and our board of directors on an ongoing basis 
we measure interest rate risk using a variety of methodologies including  but not limited to  dynamic simulation analysis and static balance sheet rate shocks 
dynamic simulation analysis is the primary tool used to measure interest rate risk and allow us to model the effects of non parallel movements in multiple yield curves  changes in borrower and depositor behaviors  changes in loan and deposit pricing  and changes in loan and deposit portfolio compositions and growth rates over a month horizon 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we utilize static balance sheet rate shocks to estimate the potential impact on net interest income of changes in interest rates under various rate scenarios 
this analysis estimates a percentage of change in these metrics from the stable rate base scenario versus alternative scenarios of rising and falling market interest rates by instantaneously shocking a static balance sheet 
the following table summarizes the simulated change over a month horizon as of december  and changes in interest rates basis points increase decrease in net interest income december  base december  base each rate scenario reflects unique prepayment and repricing assumptions 
because of uncertainties related to customer behaviors  loan and deposit pricing levels  competitor behaviors  and socio economic factors that could effect the shape of the yield curves  this analysis is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the affect actual changes in market rates will have on us 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis includes assumptions that i the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at year end will remain constant over the measurement period  and ii changes in market rates are parallel and instantaneous across the yield curve regardless of duration or repricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities 
further  this analysis does not contemplate any actions that we might undertake in response to changes in market factors 
accordingly  this analysis is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the affect actual changes in market rates will have on us
