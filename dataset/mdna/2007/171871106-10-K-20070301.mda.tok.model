these include a intellectual property indemnities to customers in connection with the use  sales and or license of products and services  b indemnities to customers in connection with losses incurred while performing services on their premises  c indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence or willful misconduct of the company  and d indemnities involving the representations and warranties in certain contracts 
in addition  the company has made contractual commitments to several employees providing for payments upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events 
the majority of these indemnities  commitments  and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum potential for future payments that the company could be obligated to make 
except for amounts recorded in relation to insured losses  the company has not recorded a liability for these indemnities  commitments  and other guarantees in the consolidated balance sheets  except as described below 
the company indemnified the buyer of the broadband assets against certain potential claims  but all indemnifications have expired except for those related to title and authorization 
the title and authorization indemnification was capped at of the purchase price of the broadband assets  which is approximately million

additionally  the company s senior management has discussed the critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit and finance committee 
the company s significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the discussion below addresses major judgments used in revenue recognition  accounting for allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable  reviewing the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  reviewing the carrying values of property  plant  and equipment  accounting for business combinations  accounting for taxes  and 
table of contents accounting for pension and postretirement expenses 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue as services are provided 
local and special access fees  which are billed monthly  and prepaid wireless receipts are collected in advance  but the revenue is not recognized until the service is provided 
postpaid wireless  long distance  switched access  data center management services  reciprocal compensation  and data and internet product services are billed monthly in arrears 
the company bills service revenue in regular monthly cycles  which are spread throughout the days of the month 
as the last day of each billing cycle rarely coincides with the end of the company s reporting period for usage based services such as postpaid wireless  long distance  and switched access  the company must estimate service revenues earned but not yet billed 
the company bases its estimates upon historical usage and adjusts these estimates during the period in which the company can determine actual usage  typically in the following reporting period 
advanced billings for customer wireline phone service connection and activation are deferred and amortized into revenue on a straight line basis over the average customer life 
the associated connection and activation costs  to the extent of the upfront fees  are also deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the average customer life 
for wireless activation revenue  since activation costs exceed activation revenues  both the activation revenue and associated costs are recorded upon the sale of the wireless handset 
with respect to arrangements with multiple deliverables  the company follows the guidance in eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to determine whether more than one unit of accounting exists in an arrangement 
to the extent that the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting  total consideration is allocated to the individual units of accounting based on their relative fair value  determined by the price of each deliverable when it is regularly sold on a stand alone basis 
revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting as delivered or as service is performed depending on the nature of the deliverable comprising the unit of accounting 
the company recognizes equipment revenue generally upon the performance of contractual obligations  such as shipment  delivery  installation or customer acceptance 
the company is a reseller of it and telephony equipment and considers the criteria of eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  when recording revenue  such as title transfer  risk of product loss  and collection risk 
based on this guidance  these equipment revenues and associated costs have generally been recorded on a gross basis  rather than recording the revenues net of the associated costs 
pricing of local services is generally subject to oversight by both state and federal regulatory commissions 
such regulation also covers services  competition and other public policy issues 
various regulatory rulings and interpretations could result in adjustments to revenue in future periods 
the company monitors these proceedings closely and adjusts revenue accordingly 
accounting for allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable the company established the allowances for uncollectible accounts using percentages of aged accounts receivable balances to reflect the historical average of credit losses as well as specific provisions for certain identifiable  potentially uncollectible balances 
the company believes its allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate based on these methods 
however  if one or more of the company s larger customers were to default on its accounts receivable obligations or if general economic conditions in the company s operating area deteriorated  the company could be exposed to potentially significant losses in excess of the provisions established 
substantially all of the company s outstanding accounts receivable balances are with entities located within its geographic operating areas 
regional and national telecommunications companies account for the remainder of the company s accounts receivable balances 
no one entity or collection of legally affiliated entities represents or more of the outstanding accounts receivable balances 
reviewing the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets pursuant to statement of financial account standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

table of contents substantially all of the company s goodwill relates to its wireless segment 
the company estimated the fair value of cbw based on expected future cash flows generated by cbw discounted at 
the estimated fair value of cbw was higher than its carrying value  and  as such  there was no indication of impairment in indefinite lived intangible assets consist of fcc licenses for spectrum and trademarks for the wireless segment 
the company may renew the wireless licenses in a routine manner every ten years for a nominal fee  provided the company continues to meet the service and geographic coverage provisions required by the fcc 
the fair value of the licenses was determined by using the greenfield method  an income based approach 
the fair value of the trademarks were determined by using the relief from royalty method  which estimates the present value of royalty expense that could be avoided in the operating business as a result of owning the respective asset or technology 
the fair value of the licenses and trademarks were higher than its carrying value  and  as such  there was no indication of impairment in reviewing the carrying values of property  plant and equipment the company s provision for depreciation of its telephone plant is determined on a straight line basis using the group depreciation method 
provision for depreciation of other property  other than leasehold improvements  is based on the straight line method over the estimated economic useful life 
depreciation of leasehold improvements is based on a straight line method over the lesser of the economic useful life or term of the lease  including option renewal periods if renewal of the lease is probable or reasonably assured 
repairs and maintenance expense items are charged to expense as incurred 
the company estimates the useful lives of plant and equipment in order to determine the amount of depreciation expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
the majority of the local segment plant and equipment is depreciated using the group method  which develops a depreciation rate annually based on the average useful life of a specific group of assets rather than for each individual asset as would be utilized under the unit method 
the estimated life of the group changes as the composition of the group of assets and their related lives change 
such estimated life of the group is based on historical experience with similar assets  as well as taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated  or in a different form than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation expense in future periods 
likewise  if the anticipated technological or other changes occur more slowly than expected  the life of the group could be extended based on the life assigned to new assets added to the group 
this could result in a reduction of depreciation expense in future periods 
a one year decrease or increase in the useful life of these assets would increase or decrease annual depreciation expense by approximately million 
the company reviews the carrying value of long lived assets  other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets discussed above  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
in assessing impairments  the company follows the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset or group of assets and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
during the fourth quarter of  the company shortened the estimated remaining economic useful life of its legacy tdma wireless network to december  due to the expected migration of its tdma customer base to its gsm network 
the company made the decision in the first quarter of to retire certain tdma assets in order to optimize its tdma network performance 
as a result of this early retirement of assets  in the first quarter of the company recorded a charge of million under the caption asset impairments and other charges 
in the second quarter of  the useful life of certain of the remaining tdma assets was shortened from the december  date being used  and depreciation was accelerated 
the change in depreciation expense due to the change in estimate in the second quarter decreased operating income and net income by million and million  respectively  basic and diluted earnings per share were decreased by per share as a result of this change in estimate 
in the fourth quarter of  due to the rapid migration of tdma customers to the company s gsm network and decreased revenue per remaining tdma subscriber  the company determined that the carrying value of the tdma assets was not recoverable from the estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the assets 
therefore  an impairment charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of to record the tdma assets at fair value 
the company calculated the 
table of contents fair value of the assets based on the appraised amount at which the assets could be sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
the impairment charge was recorded in the consolidated statements of operations under the caption asset impairments and other charges 
after the impairment charges  the carrying value of the tdma assets was less than million at december  to satisfy increasing demand for existing voice minutes of use by customers as well as to provide enhanced data services such as streaming video  the company intends to construct a g network and deploy it on the newly purchased aws spectrum 
due to this implementation  lives of certain gsm assets were shortened and depreciation has been accelerated based on the new useful life 
the increase in depreciation due to this acceleration was approximately million in the fourth quarter of if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than expected  it may have the effect of shortening the estimated depreciable life of other network and operating assets that the company employs 
this could have a substantial impact on the consolidated depreciation expense and net income of the company 
competition from new or more cost effective technologies could affect the company s ability to generate cash flow from its network based services 
this competition could ultimately result in an impairment of certain of the company s tangible or intangible assets 
this could have a substantial impact on the operating results of the consolidated company 
accounting for business combinations in accounting for business combinations  the company applies the accounting requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  which requires the recording of net assets of acquired businesses at fair value 
in developing estimates of fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities  the company analyzes a variety of factors including market data  estimated future cash flows of the acquired operations  industry growth rates  current replacement cost for fixed assets  and market rate assumptions for contractual obligations 
where the business combination is of significant magnitude  the company engages third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to the intangible assets 
in determining the fair value of the company s intangible assets associated with the purchases of ati and the remaining minority interest in cbw  the company utilized several valuation methods excess earnings method this method was used to determine the fair value of the company s customer relationships 
this method estimates the present value of future cash flows attributable to the company s customer base and requires estimates of the expected future earnings and remaining useful lives of the customer relationships 
relief from royalty this method  used to determine the fair value of the company s trademarks  estimates the present value of royalty expense that could be avoided in the operating business as a result of owning the respective asset or technology 
greenfield the company s licenses were valued using the greenfield method  which utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis assuming a start up business  in which the only assets of the business at start up are assumed to be the fcc licenses to be valued 
changes to the assumptions the company used to estimate fair value could impact the recorded amounts for acquired assets and liabilities  including property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
significant changes to these balances could have a material impact on the company s future reported results 
accounting for taxes income taxes the income tax provision consists of an amount for taxes currently payable and an amount for tax consequences deferred to future periods 
the company s previous tax filings are subject to normal reviews by regulatory agencies until the related statute of limitations expires 
the company believes an adequate provision has been made for all open tax years in accordance with sfas no 
the ultimate resolution of these issues may differ from the amounts currently estimated  in which case an adjustment would be made to the tax provision in that period 
see recently issued accounting standards below for further discussion of fasb interpretation 
table of contents no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb fin  which changes the requirements for recognition of tax benefits associated with tax deductions 
in february  the kentucky revenue cabinet issued state tax regulations  which may limit the company s ability to use its state net operating loss carryforwards against future state taxable income 
the company recorded a one time income tax charge of million in the first quarter of as of december   the company had million in net deferred tax assets  which includes approximately billion in gross federal tax net operating loss carryforwards  with a deferred tax asset value of approximately million 
the tax loss carryforwards are available to the company to offset taxable income in current and future periods 
the company utilized approximately million of net federal tax net operating loss carryforwards during the majority of the remaining tax loss carryforwards will expire between and and are not currently limited under us tax laws 
the ultimate realization of the deferred income tax assets depends upon the company s ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which basis differences and other deductions become deductible and prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards 
based on current income levels and anticipated future reversal of existing temporary differences  the company expects to utilize its federal net operating loss carryforwards within their expiration periods 
in addition to the federal tax net operating loss carryforwards  the company has state and local net operating loss carryforwards with a deferred tax asset value of approximately million  alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  and deferred tax temporary differences and other tax attributes of approximately million 
a valuation allowance of million is provided at december  against certain state and local net operating losses and other deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the company s ability to utilize the assets within the statutory expiration period 
the company determines the effective tax rate by dividing income tax expense by income before taxes as reported in its consolidated statement of operations 
for reporting periods prior to the end of the company s fiscal year  the company records income tax expense based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate 
this rate is computed using the statutory tax rate and an estimate of annual net income adjusted for an estimate of non deductible expenses 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company s income taxes 
operating taxes the company incurs certain operating taxes that are reported as expenses in operating income  such as property  sales  use  and gross receipts taxes 
these taxes are not included in income tax expense because the amounts to be paid are not dependent on the level of income generated by the company 
the company also records expense against operating income for the establishment of liabilities related to certain operating tax audit exposures 
these liabilities are established based on the company s assessment of the probability of payment 
upon resolution of an audit  any remaining liability not paid is released and increases operating income 
the company recognized expense of million in and income of million in and million in upon resolution of operating tax audits  net of new liabilities established 
accounting for pension and postretirement expenses the pension protection act of the act was enacted on august  most of its provisions will become effective in the act significantly changes the funding requirements for single employer defined benefit pension plans 
the funding requirements will now largely be based on a plan s calculated funded status  with faster amortization of any shortfalls or surpluses 
the act directs the us treasury department to develop a new yield curve to discount pension obligations for determining the funded status of a plan when calculating the funding requirements 
the company has projected million of expected cash contributions in for pension benefits 
based on current assumptions  the company believes it will pay an estimated million to fund its pension plans during the period to in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

   and r sfas 
sfas requires the company to recognize the overfunded or 
table of contents underfunded status for the company s benefit plans  with changes in the funded status recognized as a separate component to shareowners equity 
sfas also requires the company to measure the funded status of the benefit plans as of the year end balance sheet date no later than effective december   the company adopted sfas see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company sponsors three noncontributory defined benefit pension plans one for eligible management employees  one for non management employees and one supplemental  nonqualified  unfunded plan for certain senior executives 
the company also provides health care and group life insurance benefits for eligible retirees 
the key assumptions used to account for the plans are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the actuarial assumptions attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expenses and liabilities related to these plans 
the most significant of these numerous assumptions  which are reviewed annually  include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates 
discount rate a discount rate is selected annually to measure the present value of the benefit obligations 
in determining the selection of a discount rate  the company estimates the timing and amounts of expected future benefit payments and applies a yield curve developed to reflect yields available on high quality bonds 
based on the analysis  the discount rate was set at for all of the plans as of december  the discount rate was set at for all of the plans as of december  at december   the discount rates were set at and for the pension plans and postretirement plans  respectively 
expected rate of return the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  developed using the building block approach  is based on the following the participant s benefit horizons  the mix of investments held directly by the plans  which is generally equities and bonds  and the current view of expected future returns  which is influenced by historical averages 
the required use of an expected versus actual long term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized pension expense or income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term returns are designed to approximate the actual long term returns 
to the extent the company changed its estimate of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  there would be an impact on pension expense or income and the associated net liability or asset 
the company uses an assumed long term rate of return of for the company s pension and postretirement trusts 
actual asset returns for the pension trusts  which represent almost of invested assets  were approximately in and in in its pension calculations  the company utilizes the market related value of plan assets  which is a calculated asset value that recognizes changes in asset fair values in a systematic and rational manner 
differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the market related value of plan assets over five years 
health care cost trend the company s health care cost trend rate is developed on historical cost data  the near term outlook  and an assessment of likely long term trends 
the health care cost trend rate used to measure the postretirement health benefit obligation at december  was and is assumed to decrease gradually to by the year 
table of contents the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to the changing market and economic conditions and other changes 
revisions to and variations from these estimates would impact assets  liabilities  costs of services and products and selling  general and administrative expenses 
the following table represents the sensitivity of changes in certain assumptions related to the company s pension and postretirement plans point change pension benefits postretirement and other benefits dollars in millions increase decrease in obligation increase decrease on expense increase decrease in obligation increase decrease on expense discount rate expected return on assets n a n a health care cost trend rate n a n a the assumption for cost sharing with retirees is also important to determining the postretirement and other benefits expense 
the company s collectively bargained for labor contracts have historically had limits on the company funded portion of retiree medical costs referred to as caps 
however  the company had waived the premiums in excess of the caps for bargained for retirees who retired during the contract period 
similar benefits have been provided to non bargained retirees 
prior to december   the company s actuarial calculation of retiree medical costs included the assumption that the caps were in place in accordance with the terms of the collectively bargained for agreement 
effective december   based on its past practice of waiving the retiree medical cost caps  the company began accounting for its retiree medical benefit obligation as if there were no caps 
the accounting using this assumption remained in effect through may in may  the company reached an agreement with the union for bargained for employees as to the terms of a new labor contract 
employees retiring under the new agreement are provided company sponsored healthcare through the use of individual health reimbursement accounts hras  which provides for company contributions of a fixed amount per retiree that the retiree can use to purchase their healthcare from among the various plans offered 
the company agreed to increase the hra amount annually over the life of the labor agreement 
the retiree pays for healthcare premiums and other costs in excess of the hra amount 
contrary to past practice  no agreement was made to waive the implementation of this cost sharing feature 
based on this new agreement  effective june   the company modified its assumptions for the actuarial calculation of retiree medical costs  including assumptions regarding cost sharing by retirees 
postretirement medical and other expenses were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the assumption change for cost sharing with retirees was the primary cause for the million increase in post retirement and other benefits expense in compared to at december   the company had unrecognized net losses of million for the pension plans and million for the postretirement and other benefit plans 
the unrecognized net losses have been primarily generated by changes in previous years related to discount rates  asset return differences and actual health care costs 
because gains and losses reflect refinements in estimates as well as real changes in economic values and because some gains in one period may be offset by losses in another or vice versa  the company is not required to recognize these gains and losses in the period that they occur 
instead  if the gains and losses exceed a corridor defined in the accounting literature  the company amortizes the excess over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan 

table of contents regulatory matters and competitive trends federal the telecommunications act of was enacted with the goal of establishing a pro competitive  deregulatory framework to promote competition and investment in advanced telecommunications facilities and services to all americans 
since  federal regulators have considered a multitude of proceedings ostensibly aimed at fulfilling the goals of the act and this process is continuing through numerous proceedings currently before the fcc and the federal courts 
although the act called for a deregulatory framework  the fcc s approach has been to maintain significant regulatory restraints on the traditional incumbent local exchange carriers while opening up opportunities for new competitive entrants and services with minimal regulation such as cable modem broadband providers and voip providers 
while cincinnati bell has expanded beyond its incumbent local exchange operations by offering wireless  long distance  broadband service  internet access and out of territory competitive local exchange services  the majority of its revenue is still derived from its traditional local exchange services 
the financial impact of the various federal proceedings will depend on many factors including the extent of competition in our market and the timing and outcome of the fcc s decisions and any appeals from those decisions 
intercarrier compensation current rules specify different means of compensating carriers for the use of their networks depending on the type of traffic and technology used by the carriers 
the fcc has opened a proceeding to consider various plans that have been proposed for revising the disparate intercarrier compensation system into a unified regime that treats all traffic in a uniform manner 
the outcome of this proceeding could have significant impacts on all carriers and will probably be phased in over a five to ten year period 
this proceeding impacts the switched access and end user components of cbt s revenue 
reciprocal compensation although the topic of reciprocal compensation will ultimately be addressed within the broader intercarrier compensation proceeding mentioned above  the fcc adopted an order which in the short term directly impacted the rules for the termination of isp bound dial up traffic 
the previous rules capped the total number of minutes that could be compensated growth cap and limited compensation to markets in which the carriers previously exchanged traffic new markets rule 
the fcc s new order eliminated the growth cap and the new markets rule 
this decision could increase the amount that cbt must pay to clecs with which it exchanges such traffic 
however  several carriers have sought reconsideration of the decision by the fcc and other carriers have filed appeals with the federal court 
voip during the fcc declared that voip services are interstate services and purported to preempt state regulation 
in addition  the fcc has considered several petitions asking it to rule on whether and under what circumstances voice services utilizing internet protocol ip are subject to access charges 
it has ruled that peer to peer internet voice services that do not use the public switched telephone network pstn are not subject to access charges 
separately  it has ruled that services that originate and terminate on the pstn but employ ip in the middle are subject to access charges 
the fcc is still considering other voip petitions  including one that seeks to exempt from access charges calls that originate using voip  but terminate on the pstn 
in addition  the fcc is considering a broader rulemaking proceeding to determine the regulatory status of ip enabled services generally 
special access in early the fcc opened a proceeding to review the current special access pricing rules 
under the existing rules  cbt s special access services are subject to price cap regulation with no earnings cap 
the new proceeding is examining the entire special access pricing structure  including whether or not to reinstate an earnings cap 

table of contents universal service the federal universal service fund is currently funded via an assessment on all telecommunications carriers interstate end user revenue 
the fcc is currently considering alternatives to this method of funding 
some of the alternatives being considered include expanding the base to include intrastate revenue or switching to an assessment based on connections and telephone numbers 
any such alteration could result in a change in the manner in which carriers recover their contributions from end users 
unbundled network elements in early  the fcc rewrote its unbundled network element rules in response to the federal court s remand of the previous rules 
the latest rules have no significant impact on cbt 
however  the elimination of unbundled circuit switching  and thus the une platform une p  required cbet to migrate its une p lines to alternative arrangements by march  and or to negotiate with the underlying ilec for continued provision of une p  which cbet did pursuant to a commercial agreement 
this is not expected to have a significant adverse impact on cbet since cbet had already planned to migrate the majority of its customers to its own switching facilities 
broadband internet access in an order adopted in the third quarter of  the fcc provided wireline carriers the option of offering broadband internet access as a non regulated information service comparable treatment to cable modem internet access or as a regulated telecommunications service 
each option has associated costs and benefits that must be weighed in light of a carrier s current mix of existing services and new services the carrier may be contemplating offering in the future 
fcc inquiry regarding safeguards to protect customer proprietary network information cpni by letter dated march   the enforcement bureau of the fcc directed the company to provide information and documents necessary for the bureau to determine whether the company has implemented adequate safeguards and or taken appropriate security measures pursuant to section of the communications act of  as amended  to protect customer proprietary network information cpni 
the company timely submitted its response 
on october   the fcc issued a follow up letter asking for additional information 
the company responded to the fcc s subsequent letter on november  state because cbt generates the majority of its revenue from the operation of its public switched telephone network  its financial results follow no particular seasonal pattern 
cbt does derive a significant portion of its revenue from pricing plans that are subject to regulatory overview and approval 
in both ohio and kentucky  cbt operates under alternative regulation plans in which cbt cannot increase the price of basic local services and is subject to restrictions on its ability to increase the price of other related services 
in return  cbt is not subject to an earnings cap or recapture in ohio  as it would if regulated under a traditional regulatory plan based upon a targeted rate of return 
cbt has operated under alternative regulation plans since during which price increases and enhanced flexibility for a limited number of services have partially offset the effect of fixed pricing for basic local service and reduced pricing for other  primarily wholesale services 
in june  cbt adopted a new alternative regulation plan in ohio  which  although similar to its previous plan  gives cbt the option to remain in the alternative regulation plan indefinitely 
also  cbt s new plan requires the local segment to operate as a clec in service areas outside of cbt s traditional ilec franchise area 
for approximately the past six years  cbt has offered local services  primarily on its own facilities based network  to ohio communities contiguous to its ilec territory 
in dayton  the local segment has provided its voice services offering using the port loop transport combination une p as well as the une l regulatory format 
on february   the fcc released its unbundled network elements order on remand which will effectively abolish une p as a regulated service and has left each carrier to negotiate new pricing arrangements under commercial agreements 
the local segment has entered into such an agreement  however  it does not expect the profitability of its dayton local operations to change substantially because the segment had planned to migrate the provisioning of service to une l  which is a more economic service delivery model as the segment has gained customers 

table of contents statutory changes enacted by the ohio general assembly in august give the public utilities commission of ohio the puco the authority to provide ilecs with pricing flexibility for basic local rates upon a showing that consumers have sufficient competitive alternatives house bill 
in may  the puco adopted rules in accordance with the new law to establish more detailed requirements for ohio ilecs to apply for this additional pricing flexibility 
on august   the company applied for authority to increase its rates for basic local exchange service in certain of its exchanges 
in november  the puco granted the company s application 
in january  the puco denied a request  by the ohio consumer counsel  for a re hearing

historically  the company has evaluated uncorrected differences utilizing the rollover approach 
the company believes the impact of not recording the operating taxes was not material to prior fiscal years under the rollover method 
however  under sab  adopted in  the company must assess materiality using both the rollover method and the iron curtain method  which resulted in the million adjustment to opening retained earnings 
the expense from the cumulative error arose from the following periods dollars in millions prior to expense adjustment before income taxes expense adjustment after income taxes the after tax amounts for associated with the first three quarters of the year were million in the first quarter  million in the second quarter  and million in the third quarter  and have been determined to be immaterial to those quarters 
accordingly  the entire impact for has been recorded in the fourth quarter

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk management the company s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings  cash flows  and the fair market value of certain assets and liabilities  while maintaining low overall borrowing costs 

table of contents because the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate fluctuations  primarily in the form of variable rate borrowings from its credit facility and changes in current rates compared to that of its fixed rate debt  the company sometimes employs derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to these fluctuations and its total interest expense over time 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or enter into transactions for speculative purposes 
interest rate swap agreements  a particular type of derivative financial instrument  involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between the company and its counterparties in the transactions and do not represent an actual exchange of the notional amounts between the parties 
because the notional amounts are not exchanged  the notional amounts of these agreements are not indicative of the company s exposure resulting from these derivatives 
the amounts to be exchanged between the parties are primarily the net result of the fixed and variable rate percentages to be charged on the swap s notional amount 
in june  the company entered into a series of fixed to variable interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of million that qualify for fair value hedge accounting 
in february and march  in conjunction with the company s refinancing plan  an additional million in fixed to variable interest rate swaps were executed which were also designated as fair value hedges 
fair value hedges offset changes in the fair value of underlying assets and liabilities 
the company s interest rate swaps at december  and are recorded at their fair value  and the carrying values of the underlying liabilities hedged the notes and notes are adjusted by the same corresponding value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was a liability of million and million at december  and  respectively
