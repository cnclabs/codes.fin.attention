item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of national health investors  inc for the periods presented and should be read together with the notes thereto contained in this annual report on form k 
other important factors are identified in item business above 
executive overview national health investors  inc nhi or the company  a maryland corporation  is a real estate investment trust reit that invests primarily in income producing health care properties with emphasis on the long term health care sector 
as of december   we had interests in real estate owned  and investments in mortgages  preferred stock and marketable securities resulting in total invested assets of  founded in  our mission is to invest in health care real estate which generates current income that will be distributed to stockholders 
we have pursued this mission by making mortgage loans and acquiring properties to lease nationwide  primarily in the long term health care industry 
portfolio as of december   we had investments in real estate and mortgage notes receivable in health care facilities located in states consisting of long term care facilities  acute care hospital  medical office buildings  assisted living facilities  retirement centers and residential projects for the developmentally disabled 
these investments consisted of approximately  aggregate carrying value amount of loans to borrowers and  of real estate investments with lessees 
of these facilities  are leased to national healthcare corporation nhc  a publicly held company and our largest customer 
these facilities include four centers subleased to and operated by other companies  the lease payments of which are guaranteed to us by nhc 
our investment advisor was nhc until november  of these facilities  were acquired through foreclosure 
the facilities have been sold  but we have not yet met the accounting criteria described in statement of financial accounting standards no 
to record the sales for financial statement purposes 
the facilities are managed by subsidiaries of nhc 
consistent with our strategy of diversification  we have increased our portfolio so that the portion of our portfolio leased by nhc has been reduced from of our total portfolio on october  the date we began operations to of total real estate portfolio on december   based on the net book value of these properties 
in  these assets were transferred by nhc to nhi at their then current net book value  in a non taxable exchange 
many of these assets were substantially depreciated as a result of having been carried on nhc s books for as many as years 
as a result  we believe that the fair market value of these assets is significantly in excess of their net book value 
to illustrate  rental income in from nhc was  or approximately of our net book value of the facilities leased to nhc 
subsequent additions to the portfolio related to non nhc investments refl ect their higher value based on existing costs at the date the investment was made 
as with all assets in our portfolio  we monitor the financial and operating results of each of these properties on a quarterly basis 
in addition to reviewing the consolidated financial results of nhc  the individual center financial results are reviewed including their occupancy  patient mix  state survey results and other relevant information 
at december   of the total invested assets of the health care facilities were operated by publicly traded operators  by regional operators  and by small operators

even as we make new investments  however  we expect to maintain a relatively low level of debt vs 
equity compared to our historical levels 
new investments may be funded by our liquid investments and  if needed  by external financing 
we will make new investments where we believe the spreads over our cost of capital will generate returns to our investors 
we have focused on increasing our liquidity and lowering our debt 
our debt to capitalization ratio on december  was  the lowest level in our year history 
our liquidity is also strong with cash and marketable securities of  at december  compared to  at december  our total debt outstanding was  and  at december  and respectively 
on december   we reached an agreement with nhc to extend through december   our current lease on of our real estate properties 
these facilities include four centers leased to other parties and three retirement centers 
this extension assures an ongoing relationship with our largest customer 
as a result of our strong liquidity  we anticipated making new portfolio investments during although we evaluated a number of potential new investments during the year  none were closed 
at this time  we are continuing to cautiously evaluate new portfolio investments and monitor the current prices being offered for health care assets 
acquisition offer on october   we received an offer from w 
andrew adams  our chairman and ceo  a significant shareholder and president of management advisory source  llc  nhi s management advisor  to acquire all of our outstanding shares of common stock for per share 
the offer was subject to certain conditions and contingencies 
the board of directors formed a special committee of independent directors for the purpose of evaluating strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value 
additionally  the special committee hired the blackstone group lp as its financial advisor to assist in evaluating this or any other proposed transactions 
the special committee subsequently informed mr 
adams that it considered his proposal inadequate 
on january   we received a revised offer from mr 
adams to acquire all of our outstanding shares of common stock for per share payable through a dividend and common stock purchase price 
on february  the special committee of national health investors  informed mr 
adams that it considered the revised offer not to be in the best interests of nhi s public stockholders and requested that management further develop and implement a wide ranging strategic plan to enhance the business and shareholder value of nhi 
since that date  mr 
adams has continued to express to the special committee his interest in a transaction  however  no agreement has been reached with respect to an acquisition offer from mr 
adams or his related entities  and management continues to work on the plan requested by the special committee 
nhi does not intend to update the status of any negotiations with respect to a poten tial transaction unless required by law to make such disclosure 
on october   a lawsuit was filed in chancery court for the state of tennessee  rutherford county  against us and the individual directors serving on the special committee alleging breach of fiduciary duty and improper action in connection with the offer by mr 
adams 
we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and on january   an amended lawsuit was filed against nhi and the members of the special committee 
the amended complaint rendered the motion to dismiss moot 
the plaintiff has indicated that he intends to amend the complaint a second time by the end of march 
we have responded to discovery and intend to vigorously defend the plaintiff s allegations 
nhi has previously indemnified all members of the board of directors for all actions related to nhi  including serving on the special committee 
nhi expects that indemnification to cover the expenses incurred by the directors in the defens e of this action 
critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  liquidity and or financial condition 
we consider an accounting estimate or assumption critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
refer to note to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact us 
there have been no material changes to these policies in our significant accounting policies and the associated estimates  judgments and the issues which impact these estimates are as follows valuations and impairments to our investments the majority of our tenants and borrowers are in the long term health care industry and derive their revenues primarily from medicare  medicaid and other government programs 
amounts paid under these government programs are subject to legislative and government budget constraints 
from time to time  there may be material changes in government reimbursement 
in the past  the long term health care industry has at times experienced material reductions in government reimbursement 
the long term health care industry has also experienced a dramatic increase in professional liability claims and in the cost of insurance to cover such claims 
these factors have combined to cause a number of bankruptcy filings  bankruptcy court rulings and court judgments about refinancing for our lessees and mortgagees 
prior to  we had determined that impairment of certain of our investments had occurred as the result of these events 
decisions about valuations and impairments of our investments require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for real estate properties  the need to recognize an impairment is evaluated on a property by property basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets sfas 
the determination and recording of an impairment is based upon estimated future undiscounted cash flows from a property compared to the carrying amount of the property and may be affected by management s plans  if any  to dispose of the property 
for notes receivable  impairment recognition is based upon an evaluation of the estimated collectibility of loan payments and general economic conditions on a specific loan basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas 
on a quarterly basis  nhi reviews its notes receivable for recoverability when events or circumstances  including the non receipt of principal and interest payments  significant deteriorations of the financial condition of the borrower and significant adverse changes in general economic conditions  indicate that the carrying amount of the note receivable may not be recoverable 
if necessary  an impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the discounted cash flows expected to be received under the note receivabl e or  if foreclosure is probable  the fair value of the collateral securing the note receivable 
we evaluate our marketable securities for other than temporary impairments consistent with the provisions of statement of financial accountant standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas as amended by eitf the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
an impairment of a marketable security would be considered other than temporary unless we have the ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the cost of the investment and evidence indicates the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time 
while we believe that the carrying amounts of our properties  notes receivable  marketable securities and other investments are realizable and or recoverable  it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates 
revenue recognition mortgage interest and rental income we collect interest and rent from our customers 
generally our policy is to recognize revenues on an accrual basis as earned 
however  there are certain of our customers for which we have determined  based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections  that revenue for interest or rent may not be realizable 
for these nonperforming investments  our policy is to recognize interest or rental income when assured  which we consider to be the period the amounts are collected 
we identify investments as nonperforming if a required payment is not received within days of the date it is due 
this policy could cause our revenues to vary significantly from period to period 
revenue from minimum lease payments under our leases is recognized on a straight line basis as required under statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for leases sfas to the extent that future lease payments are considered collectible 
lease payments that depend on a factor directly related to future use of the property  such as an increase in annual revenues over a base year revenues  are considered to be contingent rentals and are excluded from minimum lease payments in accordance with sfas reit status and taxes we believe that we have operated our business so as to qualify as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner  but no assurance can be given that we will be able to qualify at all times 
if we qualify as a reit  we will generally not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on our net income that is currently distributed to our stockholders 
this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation at the corporate and stockholder levels that typically applies to corporate dividends 
our failure to continue to qualify under the applicable reit qualification rules and regulations would cause us to owe state and federal income taxes and would have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
revenue recognition third party payors approximately two thirds of our facility operating revenues are derived from medicare  medicaid  and other government programs 
amounts earned under these programs are subject to review by the third party payors 
in our opinion  adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from these reviews 
any differences between our estimates of settlements and final determinations are reflected in operations in the year finalized 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of funds our primary sources of cash include rent and interest receipts  the revenues of facilities we operate  proceeds from the sales of real property and principal payments on loans receivable 
our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions  the expenses of facilities we operate  debt service payments including principal and interest  real property acquisitions and general and administrative expenses 
these sources and uses of cash are reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and are discussed in further detail below

we may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure 
at december   we did not participate in any such financial instruments 
commitments at december   we were committed  subject to due diligence and financial performance goals  to fund approximately  in health care real estate projects  all of which is expected to be funded within the next months 
the commitments include additional mortgage investments for three long term health care centers  at an interest rate of prime plus 
we currently have sufficient liquidity to finance current investments for which we are committed to repay or refinance borrowings at or prior to their maturity  and to pay dividends required to maintain our reit status 
real estate  mortgage and notes receivable write downs recoveries our borrowers  tenants and the properties we operate as foreclosure properties have experienced financial pressures and difficulties similar to those experienced by the health care industry in general since governments at both the federal and state levels have enacted legislation to lower or at least slow the growth in payments to health care providers 
furthermore  the costs of professional liability insurance have increased significantly during this same period 
prior to  a number of our real estate property operators and mortgage loan borrowers experienced bankruptcy 
others were forced to surrender properties to us in lieu of foreclosure

further maintenance analysis resulted in the recording of an additional  of accrued maintenance expense in the third quarter of on two florida assisted living facilities as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
see note to our financial statements for details of the properties identified as impaired real estate investments and non performing loans 
we believe that the carrying amounts of our real estate properties and notes receivable  including those identified as impaired or non performing  are recoverable and supported by the value of the underlying collateral

decreases in mortgage interest income totaling  relate primarily to prior period payoffs of mortgage and remic investments 
the  decrease in rental income in resulted primarily from decreases of  because of terminated leases and  because of delinquent leases  offset in part by increases of  from new leases and  from improved paying leases and increased percentage rent from fully paying leases 
the  increase in facility operating revenues is due primarily to the improved government payment rates and census at our foreclosure properties in massachusetts  new hampshire  kansas and missouri for the year ended december  the increase in facility operating revenues is attributable to a  increase in our massachusetts and new hampshire operating facilities and a  increase in our kansas and missouri operating facilities

the new hampshire facilities experienced a one time  state medicaid retroactive bed tax fee in applicable to and which increased expenses as compared to expenses at these facilities increased also because of inflation and service improvements to enhance census

furthermore  a gain of  on the sale  as a result of merger  of alc common stock for cash after  of the alc common sale proceeds is treated as a recovery is included in non operating income in discontinued operations during the year ended december   we sold two assisted living facilities with carrying amounts totaling  for cash proceeds of  we recognized a  gain on the sale of these facilities 
the net gain on the sale of real estate of  is composed of a  gain from a charlotte  north carolina assisted living facility sale and an  loss from a dallas  texas assisted living facility sale 
both of these assisted living facilities were sold as a result of never achieving their expected profitability as discussed in note of the notes to our financial statements 
during the prior year ended december   we sold three nursing facilities one previously designated as held for sale with carrying amounts totaling  for cash proceeds of  we recognized a gain of  on the sale of these facilities 
for and  we have reclassified the operations  including the net gain on the sale of these facilities  as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas funds from operations our funds from operations ffo for the year ended december   on a diluted basis was  an increase of  as compared to  for the same period in ffo represents net earnings available to common stockholders  excluding the effects of asset dispositions  plus depreciation associated with real estate investments 
diluted ffo assumes  if dilutive  the conversion of convertible subordinated debentures  the conversion of cumulative convertible preferred stock and the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method 
we believe that ffo is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a real estate investment trust 
because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight line depreciation except on land  such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions  presentation of operating results for a real estate investment trust that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative  and should be supplemented with a measure such as ffo 
the term ffo was designed by the real estate investment trust industry to address this issue 
our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other reits 
consequently  our funds from operations may not provide a meaningful meas ure of our performance as compared to that of other reits 
since other reits may not use our definition of ffo  caution should be exercised when comparing our company s ffo to that of other reits 
funds from operations in and of itself does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap funds from operations does not include changes in operating assets and liabilities and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net earnings as an indication of operating performance  or to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap in the united states  as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
we have complied with the sec s interpretation that recurring impairments taken on real property may not be added back to net income in the calculation of ffo 
the sec s position is that recurring impairments on real property are not an appropriate adjustment 
the following table reconciles net income to funds from operations year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands  except per share amounts net income dividends to preferred stockholders net income available to common stockholders elimination of non cash items in net income real estate depreciation real estate depreciation in discontinued operations gain on sale of real estate basic funds from operations available to common stockholders interest on convertible subordinated debentures diluted funds from operations available to common stockholders basic funds from operations per share diluted funds from operations per share shares for basic funds from operations per share shares for diluted funds from operations per share impact of inflation during the past three years  inflation has not significantly affected our earnings because of relatively moderate inflation rates 
inflation may affect us in the future by changing the underlying value of our real estate or by impacting our cost of financing its operations 
our revenues are generated primarily from long term investments with fixed rates of return 
these investments are financed through a combination of equity  long term borrowings  and  as needed  line of credit arrangements 
during periods of rising interest rates  our ability to grow may be adversely affected because yields on new investments may increase more slowly than new borrowing costs 
certain of our leases offer some degree of inflation protection by requiring increases in rental income based upon increases in the revenues of the tenants 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
the new standard requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
the company adopted sfas r beginning january  the scope of sfas r includes a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
the adoption of sfas r has resulted in the recording of compensation charges of  for options and restricted shares granted

sfas requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented on the new accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas also provides that a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long lived nonfinancial asset be accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively that was effected by a change in accounting principle  and correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement

sfas 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities 
this statement clarifies when servicing rights should be separately accounted for  requires companies to account for separately recognized servicing rights initially at fair value and gives companies the option of subsequently accounting for those servicing rights at either fair value or under the amortization method 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after september  the implementation of sfas is not expected to have material impact on the company s consolidated financ ial statements 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin

fin will require that the financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions assuming the taxing authorities full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts  but without considering time values
