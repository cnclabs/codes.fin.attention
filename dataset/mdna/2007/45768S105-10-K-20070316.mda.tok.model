item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  included elsewhere herein 
factors affecting our results the primary factor affecting our results of operations is the continuing transformation of the company s business from one which was focused on octane additives to one in which the fuel specialties and performance chemicals segments play an increasingly predominant role 
for the year ended december   the combined operating income of the fuel specialties and performance chemicals segments of our business rose  as compared with the year ended december  by comparison  for the year ended december   operating income for the octane additives segment was million  which represents a decline of approximately from operating income for the octane additives segment of our business for the year ended december  we expect that the role of the octane additives segment of our business will continue to decline in the coming years 
we expect that we will cease all sales of tel for use in automotive gasoline at some time in the future  and that we will continue to write off the business goodwill for our octane additives business until or prior to that point 
the company s strategic plan is for the growth in the fuel specialties and performance chemicals segments to off set the decline in the octane additives business 
revision to classification of certain items during the final quarter   the company revised the classification of certain shipping and handling costs and commission charges in its results for and comparable information for and previously  these charges were netted off sales and are now charged to cost of goods sold and selling expenses  respectively 
this has no impact on or any prior periods reported income before income taxes  net income  earnings per share  net cash provided by operating activities or any balance sheet category 
the classification of charges of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  with respect to shipping and handling costs has been revised from a reduction in net sales to an increase in costs of goods sold of million  million and million  respectively  and with respect to commission charges has been revised from a reduction in net sales to an increase in selling expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
the company undertook an analysis of the aggregate effect of these reclassifications on its gross margin for each of  and as originally reported  gross margin for the year ended december  was 
after giving effect to the reclassifications  gross margin would decline by an absolute amount of percentage points  to  which represents a reduction of the gross margin relative to what was originally reported 
similarly  for the year ended december   the gross margin after giving effect to the reclassifications declined from to  an absolute reduction of percentage

the revenue increase of achieved by this business unit was focused in the 
table of contents europe  middle east and africa emea region and the americas region  which delivered revenue growth of and  respectively 
there were also strong sales in the asia pacific aspac region which delivered revenue growth of albeit from a much lower base 
americas sales were driven by our strong market leading position in diesel fuel additives and the us government s adoption early in of new ultra low sulfur diesel regulations 
approximately half of the emea sales growth was due to a one off contract with a single customer 
the aspac growth was due to the benefit generated from customer contracts entered into early in the performance chemicals sales growth in was spread across each of the individual operations which comprise this business 
in absolute dollar terms however  the growth was focused in aroma fine chemicals  our aroma fragrances business  and finetex  our surfactants and emollients business 
aroma fine chemicals benefited from price increases throughout and greater production capacity which came on stream in the latter stages of the year 
during finetex leveraged its customer base to increase both sales prices and volumes across almost all of its product range 
the octane additives sales decline was limited to in dollar terms despite volumes decreasing 
this was primarily due to the richer sales mix in  compared to  and moderate price increases achieved during sales volumes were adversely impacted by south africa leaving the market for tel for use in automotive gasoline at the start of the year  and the absence in of significant shipments to south east asia 
however  sales to the middle east in remained resilient 
in aggregate terms the sales decline was limited to million as the combined sales growth of our fuel specialties and performance chemicals businesses of million went a long way in mitigating the expected continued sales decline in our octane additives business 
gross profit in millions change fuel specialties performance chemicals octane additives gross margin fuel specialties performance chemicals octane additives aggregate the increase in gross profit generated by our fuel specialties business outstripped the sales growth achieved due to improved margins 
the increase of percentage points in 
table of contents the fuel specialties gross margin was focused in the americas region and offset the lower margins seen in the emea and aspac regions 
the americas gross margin benefited from sales prices increases implemented early in and tight control of material costs throughout the year 
the emea gross margin was diluted by the impact of a one off contract with a single customer and the aspac gross margin was impacted by product mix 
the performance chemicals business delivered a increase in gross profit which again was significantly in excess of the sales growth 
this increase was generated from a percentage points improvement in gross margins spread across each of the individual operations which comprise this business segment 
this gross margin improvement was focused in finetex  innospec leuna and prochem with the latter two businesses benefiting from product mix improvements 
the decline in gross profit in our octane additives business compares favourably to the decrease in sales 
this is due to the percentage points improvement in gross margin which reflects the richer sales mix and moderate price increases achieved during overall gross profit declined to million  compared to the sales decline of  despite each of our businesses actually managing to increase their gross margins 
this is due to the fact that higher margin octane additives sales formed a smaller proportion of total sales  reducing from to  with this mix effect depressing the aggregate gross margin by percentage points 
operating expenses in millions change fuel specialties performance chemicals octane additives fas pension charge credit corporate costs increases in operating expenses in our fuel specialties and performance chemicals businesses have been limited to and  respectively  despite the sales growth of and  respectively 
this sales growth and tight cost control has been achieved by leveraging the infrastructures of these businesses 
the reduction in operating expenses of octane additives compares to the sales decline experienced in this business 
the majority of the savings were generated from reduced commission charges caused by the absence of sales to south east asia 
in accordance with fas  we were required to recognize a non cash charge of million in  primarily in respect of the amortization of prior service cost 
no similar charge was required to be recognized in 
table of contents the reduction achieved in corporate costs results from the restructuring of the corporate functions and reduced costs in relation to sarbanes oxley compliance 
there were also significant costs recognized in for the special investigation into the transfer of funds in south africa by the former ceo 
restructuring charge restructuring costs of million in  substantially reduced from the million incurred in  were comprised of severance and other restructuring costs of million and million  respectively 
the severance costs included million in respect of cost reduction programs in manufacturing and support activities on the uk octane additives manufacturing site  million in respect of additional salary and other emoluments to be paid to the former ceo and million in relation to severance of corporate staff 
the other restructuring costs comprised million in respect of site clearance in the uk  million in relation to costs associated with a plan to consolidate manufacturing activities on to one site in one of our us businesses and million in respect of the relocation of our european headquarters to the ellesmere port site 
amortization of intangible assets the amortization charge was million in and in both years a charge of million was recognized in respect of the veritel intangible asset that is being amortized on a straight line basis and as such is comparable year on year 
the remaining million in both years relates to the amortization of intangible assets recognized in the acquisition accounting in respect of finetex  aroma fine chemicals and innospec fuel specialties formerly known as octel starreon 
impairment of octane additives business goodwill the company recognized a charge of million for the impairment of octane additives business goodwill in this compares to a charge of million in since the end of there have been no significant changes in the estimates used in the detailed forecast model to calculate the impairment charges 
the charge was significantly higher in due to the loss of anticipated sales and associated cash flows from venezuela  a major customer  in the second quarter of the remaining balance of octane additives business goodwill is now million 
the company will continue to test the value of octane additives business goodwill at the end of each quarter and expects to recognize a charge of approximately to million for the months ending december   if actual cash flows are in line with the company s current forecasts 
the charge remains critically dependent upon developments that affect the company s best estimates of future volumes of octane additives  future revenue  gross margins  selling and administrative costs as well as the fixed and working capital requirements

profits loss on disposal net the company recognized million profit following the disposal of surplus real estate in the uk this was partially off set by prepaid disposal costs of million 
interest expense net net interest expense in at million was million lower than the million incurred in this reduction is primarily due to the fact that average net debt was lower in when compared to  and also due to the inclusion in the net charge of repayment of interest of million charged on a tax balance 
net debt fell by million  between the end of and  primarily due to the million of cash flows from operating activities generated by our businesses and the million of proceeds from the disposal of surplus real estate in the uk  offset by million of common stock repurchased 
moreover  this reduced net interest expense was achieved despite the fact that the us base interest rate rose between the corresponding periods 
other net income expense in other net income of million was generated of which million related to foreign exchange gains offset by million of other sundry expenses 
in other net expense of million comprised a million charge for the write off of the company s investment in stylacats in the third quarter  a charge of million to fully provide against two other investments  a million charge for exchange losses on forward foreign exchange contracts and million of other sundry expenses 
income taxes the company recognized a tax charge of million in which is million greater than the million incurred in the headline rate of income tax is compared to in however  the effective rate of tax for excluding the impairment of octane additives business goodwill was compared to in tax relief is not available on this impairment charge and accordingly we believe that the effective rate of tax is best calculated by adjusting for this non cash charge 
this adjusted effective rate has increased percentage points between the corresponding periods due to the disposition of our profits  exhaustion of us net operating losses and increased profitability of our us based fuel specialties business which suffers the standard federal tax rate of  together with state taxes 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal the following table is presented to show the incremental impact of the acquisitions of leuna  aroma fine chemicals afc and finetex in 
table of contents effect of acquisitions on group results compared to in millions as reported effect of acquisitions before acquisitions as reported net sales gross profit selling general and administrative expense research and development expense amortization of intangible assets impairment of tel business goodwill restructuring charge loss on disposals operating income the table above includes the impact of the acquisition of leuna  the results of which were consolidated for six months in  and the results of afc  the results of which have been consolidated for four months in and the results of finetex which was acquired in january the impact of the acquisition of the remaining of the shares in innospec fuel specialties llc formerly known as octel starreon llc has not been included as the results of innospec fuel specialties llc have been fully consolidated by the company since the inception of the joint venture in  with a corresponding charge in the minority interest line item 
the minority interest charge for the period to full acquisition of innospec fuel specialties llc on july  was million 
accordingly no table of the impact of acquisitions is presented for the fuel specialties business 
the effect of acquisitions on performance chemicals business results compared to is as follows in millions as reported acquisitions effect performance chemicals before acquisitions as reported net sales gross profit selling general and administrative expense research and development amortization of intangible assets business operating income net sales fuel specialties sales of million were million higher than in sales in the americas grew by due to higher sales of cetane number improver and additives for diesel ahead of new legislation 
sales in the emea region grew by and sales in the asia pacific region grew by 

table of contents the subsidiaries acquired in and at the beginning of afc  leuna and finetex contributed million of the million additional performance chemicals sales in the year 
octane additives sales volumes were below volumes but sales value declined by only mainly due to price increases 
sales volumes to the americas were down due to the loss of business in venezuela 
sales to asia pacific have proved to be resilient and volumes were actually higher than in shipments to the middle east were ahead of shipments in sales to africa fell by from the level  and in south africa left the market for use of tel in automotive gasoline 
total net sales for of million were million ahead of sales 
gross profit in fuel specialties gross profit increased by million though the gross margin fell percentage points from to 
the gross margin was impacted by the rapid growth in sales of relatively lower margin cetane number improvers in the usa and the loss of manufacturing margin as a result of the bycosin disposal in in performance chemicals  the effect of the acquisitions on the gross margin can be seen above 
the gross profit margin including the impact of acquisitions reduced percentage points to from the achieved in this is due to the fact that the acquisitions operate in markets that generate lower gross margins than the previously existing businesses in this business unit  however they also operate with lower overhead cost bases 
gross profit in the octane additives business at million was million lower than in despite sales declining in the comparable period 
gross margin decreased percentage points from to 
results in were boosted by the release of a million surplus remediation provision relating to a former octane additives manufacturing site at doberitz in germany 
in addition  in a million provision related to a take or pay contract for materials was released following a review of the likely material requirements 
following the loss of venezuela volumes in a further review of this contract was performed and as a result a provision of million was recognized in the second quarter of excluding the impact of these items the gross margin still declined due to a combination of higher unit production and raw material costs 
total gross profit for of million was million below that in the overall gross margin declined percentage points from to 
this decline was caused by the lower margins generated by all three business units in compared to  and also by higher margin octane additives sales forming a smaller proportion of overall sales in compared to down from 

table of contents operating expenses operating expenses consist of selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses 
operating expenses increased within our fuel specialties business unit due to the inclusion of legal and other costs associated with the company s voluntary disclose to ofac 
in performance chemicals the effect of the acquisitions on operating expenses can be seen from the table above 
this impact represents the majority of increase in operating expenses seen in this business unit since existing operations held their cost bases 
in the octane additives business unit the operating expenses were essentially flat as the benefit obtained from reduced selling expenses following the closure of certain sales offices was offset by additional commission charges on sales to south east asia 
due to the high proportion of inactive members in the company s principal defined benefit pension plan in the uk  the net pension charge or credit associated with this is reported separately 
the net pension credit in was million compared to a net pension charge of million in this reversal from pension credit to pension charge was mainly due to the de risking of the pension fund as a result of the decision to invest in a higher proportion of bonds rather than equities 
corporate costs declined million from million in to million in this decline primarily reflects the effect of the relocation in of the european headquarters to the ellesmere port site and the streamlining of the executive structure 
overall operating expenses increased by million in to million  million of the increase being due to the effect of acquisitions 
restructuring charge the company incurred restructuring costs of million in these costs comprised million in relation to a cost reduction program in manufacturing and support activities on the uk octane additives manufacturing site and million in respect of severance of corporate staff 
a charge of million was recognized under fas under a previous cost reduction program where the leavers stayed longer than their contractual notice periods 
associated with all of the severance programs a pension charge of million was recognized under fas as there had been a curtailment event due to the significant restructuring activity in the uk in a charge of million was recognized in relation to the closure of the european headquarters in manchester  uk this charge represented a write off of fixed assets where the value had been impaired by the closure and other costs of closure 
a charge of million was recognized relating to fixed asset write offs resulting from the closure of the fuel technology centre in bletchley  uk a charge of million was recognized relating 
table of contents to severance costs arising from the decision to relocate the research and technology activities that had previously been carried out at that site to the ellesmere port  uk site

this included million of fixed asset and other write offs and million of severance costs 
a charge of million was recognized in relation to the severance costs associated with a plan to consolidate manufacturing activities on to one site in one of our us businesses 
other charges relate to the costs of site clearance in the uk million and non uk severance in the fuel specialties business million 
a charge of million was recognized relating to the costs of salary  additional costs of professional advice and other emoluments to be paid to the former ceo pursuant to an agreement governing the terms of the former ceo s resignation dated april  amortization of intangible assets the amortization charge in of million was million higher than the million recognized in in both years a charge of million was recognized in respect of the veritel intangible asset that is being amortized on a straight line basis and as such is comparable year on year 
the remaining million relates to the amortization of intangible assets recognized in the acquisition accounting in respect of finetex  aroma fine chemicals and octel starreon now called innospec fuel specialties 
impairment of octane additives business goodwill the company recognized a charge of million for the impairment of octane additives business goodwill in the loss of anticipated sales from venezuela was the principal reason for this unexpectedly high charge and reflects the loss of the anticipated future cash flows that had previously been assumed in the detailed forecast model that supported the value of octane additives business goodwill at the end of the charge in was million 
interest expense and interest income at million the net interest expense was million higher than in this was principally because of the higher average level of net debt in when compared to the equivalent period in following the acquisition outflows in the second half of and early and the increase in us base interest rate 
in interest expense was million and interest income was million 
in interest expense was million and interest income was million 
other expense net other income and expense of million consists mainly of a million charge for the write off of the company s investment in stylacats in the third quarter  a charge of million to fully provide against two other investments  million sundry other charges and a million charge for exchange losses on forward foreign exchange contracts 

table of contents income taxes the headline rate of income tax was in compared to in the change in the effective tax rate and the reason why the company is paying taxes on a loss making operation is that the charge for the impairment of octane additives business goodwill is not an allowable deduction for tax purposes 
the effective rate of tax for excluding the impact of the octane additives business goodwill impairment charge was compared to in discontinued operations the loss of million relates to the disposal of octel performance chemicals inc and the gamlen waste water treatment business 
cash flows discussion we generated cash from operating activities of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in net cash provided by operating activities declined million from million in to million in despite our return to profitability 
the primary reason for this decline was the million increase in working capital requirement discussed more fully under working capital 
this was offset by a million movement in tax creditor due to a cash receipt from the uk tax authorities related to a tax reclaim in the first quarter of and the increased tax charge for the million net movement on plant closure provisions primarily represents the million severance payments made largely at the beginning of the million movement in the pension prepayment relates to the cash contributions made during the year to the uk contributory defined benefit pension plan 
we generated million from the disposal of property  plant and equipment  primarily following the disposal of surplus real estate in the uk  of which million was re invested in capital expenditures to support our fuel specialties and performance chemicals growth businesses and corporate it structure 
the disposal of a stake in deurex micro technologies gmbh resulted in an inflow of million 
the company drew down an additional million of revolving credit facility and repaid a million instalment on the term loan 
on april and october the company paid a semi annual dividend of cents per share aggregating to cents for the year and million in total 
in addition we repurchased million of our own common stock and raised million by the issue of treasury stock to holders of options who chose to exercise their stock options 
during large tax payments relating to tax charges from prior periods  and a low tax charge  resulted in a significant million reduction in the accrual for income taxes and other liabilities 
the million reduction in the pension prepayment was mainly due to the curtailment charge of million  relating to higher pension liabilities arising from restructuring  that was not concurrently cash funded to the uk contributory defined benefit pension plan 
the million business combinations outflow mainly represented the million acquisition of finetex  net of cash 
in january million of the former 
table of contents revolving credit facility was drawn down to finance a million scheduled loan repayment on our former term loan  and the acquisition of finetex  resulting in a net million increase in borrowings 
in december the company agreed a new financing facility and drew down the new term loan of million and million of the new revolving credit facility  repaying million owed under the old financing facility 
on april and september the company paid a semi annual dividend of cents per share aggregating to cents for the year and million in total 
the issue of treasury stock to holders of options who chose to exercise their stock options raised million and million was spent on the repurchase of  shares at an average price of 
in business combinations accounted for an million outflow 
of this million related to the cash outlay to acquire the share in octel starreon llc previously held by starreon corporation llc  million related to the acquisition of aroma fine chemicals limited afc  million was expended to acquire control of leuna polymer gmbh  million was spent to acquire a shareholding in deurex micro technologies gmbh and million was used on sundry investments in associates 
these outflows were offset by the million received from the sale of our interest in joss holdings bv 
the majority of the million proceeds on disposal of property  plant and equipment related to the million sale of our octane additives paris office 
the million increase in restricted cash related to million placed into escrow to secure and match loan notes issued by the company to the vendors as part of the consideration for afc 
in january million of the previous borrowing facility had been repaid and million of the new borrowing facility drawn down 
on april and october the company paid a semi annual dividend of cents per share aggregating to cents for the year and million in total 
liquidity and financial condition working capital in our working capital requirement increased by million 
the million increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses was spread across our three business units as a result of the increased trading in our fuel specialties and performance chemicals growth businesses and the impact of the timing of octane additives shipments compared to the corresponding period last year 
inventories increased by million also in all three business units though it was focused in fuel specialties and octane additives  the latter being due to our octane additives manufacturing strategy implemented at ellesmere port 
the million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was limited to a moderate increase within performance chemicals due to increased trading levels and a somewhat larger increase within octane additives reflecting the non cash release in the first quarter of a million retrospective pricing provision and corresponding reduction in accrued liabilities 
cash at december  and we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
in addition  at december  we had million of 
table of contents restricted cash 
the restricted cash related to million placed into escrow to secure and match loan notes issued by the company to the vendors as part of the consideration for afc 
one tranche of million was paid in january and the remaining tranche of million was paid in october debt the loss of venezuela as a major octane additives customer in the second quarter of required the company to review its current and projected operational flexibility and liquidity 
the company therefore initiated discussions with its senior lenders in the third quarter of as a result of those discussions the company agreed the terms of a new three and one half year financing facility more appropriate to the company s needs 
the facility contains terms which  if breached  would result in the loan becoming repayable on demand 
it requires  among other matters  compliance with two financial covenant ratios 
these ratios are the ratio of net debt to ebitda and the ratio of net interest to ebita 
ebitda and ebita are non us gaap measures of liquidity defined in the finance facility 
in the event that the ratio of net debt to ebitda exceeds then in addition to these covenants  the facility also requires a look forward test and an additional financial covenant ratio in the form of net operating cash flow before finance costs to scheduled debt amortization and interest costs 
this look forward test was not applicable to the company during due to such ratio not being exceeded 
as of december   the company had million of debt outstanding under its new senior credit facility agreement and was in compliance with all financial covenants therein 
the debt profile as at december   including the principal facility and other group debt  is set out below in millions current portion of long term debt long term debt  net of current portion in january the company repaid million under the principal facility consisting of the scheduled million term loan repayment and million on the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility can be drawn down upon again until the financing facility expires on june  or later if the facility is extended 
pension plans and other post employment benefits effective for fiscal year  the company adopted the provisions of fas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
fas requires that the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans be recognized on the company s 
table of contents consolidated balance sheets  and changes in the funded status be reflected in comprehensive income 
fas also requires the measurement date of the plan s funded status to be the same as the company s fiscal year end 
although the measurement date provision was not required to be adopted until fiscal year the company early adopted this provision for fiscal year the effect of applying fas was to record a total reduction to equity through recognition in accumulated other comprehensive loss of million on an after tax basis 
contractual commitments the following represents contractual commitments at december  and the effect of those obligations on future cash flows in millions total less than year to years to years over years long term debt obligations remediation payments severance payments unconditional purchase obligations capital commitments operating lease commitments interest payments on debt planned funding of pension obligations total at december  long term debt comprised million term loan and million drawn under the revolving credit facility 
at the same date long term debt obligations represent scheduled term loan repayments and amounts drawn under the revolving credit facility repaid when the financing facility expires on june   unless extended 
in january the company repaid million under the principal facility consisting of the scheduled million term loan repayment and million on the revolving credit facility 
remediation payments represent those cash flows that the company is currently obligated to pay in respect of current and former facilities 
it does not include any discretionary remediation costs that the company may choose to incur 
unconditional purchase obligations relate to certain raw material take or pay contracts which have been entered into by the company 
capital commitments relate to certain capital projects that the company has committed to undertake 
operating lease commitments relate primarily to office space  motor vehicles and items of office equipment which are expected to be renewed and replaced in the normal course of business 

table of contents the company is subject to interest at variable rates on certain elements of its long term debt 
the estimated payments included in the table above assume a constant us base interest rate of to on the main credit facility 
estimated commitment fees are also included  interest income is excluded and the impact of the company repaying million on the revolving credit facility in january is included 
the amounts related to the pension plan refer to the likely levels of company funding of the uk contributory defined benefit pension plan and certain pension commitments to senior employees 
it is not meaningful to predict an amount after five years since there are numerous uncertainties including future return on assets  pay escalation  pension increases  inflation and employment levels 
environmental matters and plant closures the company is subject to environmental laws in all of the countries in which it operates 
under certain environmental laws the company is responsible for the remediation of hazardous substances or wastes at currently or formerly owned or operated properties 
most of our manufacturing operations have been conducted outside the us and  therefore  any liability pertaining to the investigation and remediation of contaminated properties is likely to be determined under non us law 
we evaluate costs for remediation  decontamination and demolition projects on a regular basis 
full provision is made for those costs to which we are committed under environmental laws 
full provision has been made for the committed costs of million 
expenditure against provisions was million  million and million in the years  and  respectively 
we have also incurred personnel severance costs in relation to the management of the decline in the octane additives market and the restructuring of the fuel specialties business 
total severance expenditure was million  million  million in the years  and  respectively 
provision is made for severance costs under the conditions of fas and fas the provision at december  was million 
inflation inflation has not been a significant factor for the company over the last several years 
management believes that inflation will continue to be moderate over the next several years 
future outlook we undertook a detailed strategic review in and concluded that with the octane additives market gradually disappearing we needed to get to the position where the company was solidly profitable even without the profit contribution of the octane additives business unit 
we measure our progress towards achieving  and surpassing  this objective through the concept of ongoing operating profitability 

table of contents ongoing operating profitability in millions change fuel specialties operating income performance chemicals operating income fas pension charge credit corporate costs in the combined operating income of our growth businesses of fuel specialties and performance chemicals did not cover the corporate costs and fas pension charge 
however  with the significant improvement in the operating incomes of these business and substantial reduction in the corporate cost base our ongoing operating profitability was nearly million in we believe we are in a strong financial position today and our overall objective remains unchanged 
we will continue to leverage and organically grow the fuel specialties and performance chemicals businesses 
we have many internal opportunities for growth in the near term from both geographical and product line extensions 
acquisitions in these businesses are also a primary focus for us 
we believe the industries in which these businesses operate provide the greatest opportunities for a good return on investments  including associated synergies  while minimizing risk by investing in those markets where we have operating knowledge and experience 
we expect our ongoing operating profitability to improve further in there are however many variables which will determine the ultimate profitability of the company 
the impact of raw material prices  and specifically their continued volatility  remain difficult to predict 
in addition  the newly approved reach legislation in europe will impact our cost base and efforts in fuel specialties has been an outstanding year for our fuel specialties business with net sales increasing million to million and operating income increasing million to million 
this sales growth comes on top of the organic growth already experienced in gross margins increased to from in fuel specialties is now our largest business unit accounting for well over half of our revenues 
it is widely recognized that it will be increasingly difficult to sustain these levels of growth 
we therefore expect sales growth in to approximate to to per annum and gross margin to be in the to region 
this organic growth will be pursued in the company s three key regions  europe  middle east and africa emea  americas and asia pacific 

table of contents performance chemicals this was the first year in recent times which allowed like for like comparisons with the previous year following the acquisitions in  and very early in  in this business segment 
we reorganized this business in the second quarter of and the benefits started to flow from there with improved sales and profitability being demonstrated in the last two quarters of the year 
in net sales increased million to million and operating income increased million to million 
gross margins increased by percentage points from in to in we believe the performance chemicals business unit will experience an acceleration in its growth 
organic sales growth of to will be pursued across the various operations which comprise this business unit and with improved operating efficiencies and pricing our gross margins should range between to 
octane additives over the last three years octane additives sales have declined from million to million and now represent of the company s total sales compared to in however  continued cost control and flexible management of manufacturing capacity have delivered benefits and accordingly the reduction in gross profit over the equivalent three year period has been limited to 
the octane additives market has been in decline since the s and this trend is expected to continue 
moreover  following the exit from this market in and of the significant customers of south africa and venezuela  respectively  world market decline in is likely to be limited to the to range 
we will continue to manage costs within this business unit and price the product to reflect its economic value to our customers 
we expect the octane additives business to continue to be cash generative and gross margins to range between to 
following our adoption of fas in the annual amortization charge on goodwill has been replaced by an impairment review process 
the continued decline in the octane additives market will inevitably result in impairment charges in future years 
our latest review has revealed a need to recognize further impairment charges for octane additives business goodwill impairment in each period until the octane additives business cash flows are exhausted 
an annual impairment review of the goodwill relating to the fuel specialties and performance chemicals business segments indicates that there is no requirement to recognize an impairment charge in respect of this goodwill 
critical accounting estimates our objective is to clearly present our financial information in a manner that enhances the understanding of our sources of earnings and cash flows together with our financial position 
we aim to achieve this by disclosing information required by the sec together with further information that provides insight into our businesses 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses innospec s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the financial statements 
our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data disclose our accounting principles and the methods and estimates used in the preparation of those consolidated financial statements 
we believe those statements and disclosures represent fairly the operating results and financial position of the company 
the purpose of this portion of our report is to further emphasize some of the more critical areas where a significant change in facts and circumstances in our operating and financial environment could cause a change in results of operations or financial position 
the policies and estimates that the company considers the most critical in terms of subjectivity and judgment of assessment are provided below 
environmental liabilities remediation provisions at december  amounted to million and relate principally to our uk site 
the company records environmental liabilities when they are probable and costs can be estimated reasonably 
the company has to anticipate the program of work required and the associated future costs  and has to comply with environmental legislation in the relevant countries 
the company views the costs of vacating our main uk site as a contingent liability because there is no present intention to exit the site 
the company has further determined that  due to the uncertain product life of octane additives  particularly in the market for aviation gas  there exists such uncertainty as to the timing of such cash flows that it is not possible to estimate these flows sufficiently reliably to recognize a provision 
goodwill the company adopted fas  goodwill and other intangible assets effective january  this requires that goodwill deemed to have an indefinite life should no longer be amortized  but subject to an annual impairment review  or between years if events occur or circumstances change which suggest that an impairment may have occurred 

table of contents the company elected to perform its annual tests in respect of fuel specialties and performance chemicals goodwill as of december each year 
in reviewing for any impairment charge the fair value of the reporting units underlying the segments is estimated using an after tax cash flow methodology based on management s best estimates at that time 
during and  the goodwill impairment test for the octane additives business was performed annually at december both these reviews showed that the fair value of the reporting unit based on after tax cash flows at the company s weighted average cost of capital exceeded the carrying value of octane additives assets and  accordingly  no indicator of impairment existed and step of the fas impairment test was not performed 
in light of the continuing decline in the octane additives market globally  as the company makes sales of octane additives in each quarter  the remaining sales and corresponding cash flows that can be derived from the octane additives business are reduced  and accordingly the fair value of the octane additives reporting unit is reduced 
based on the company s detailed forecast model  assumptions at december  indicated that the reduction in forecast future cash flows during would reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below the carrying value of octane additives assets and  accordingly  there was likely to be a significant goodwill impairment charge during the year ended december  as a result the company determined that quarterly impairment reviews be performed from january  and any impairment charge arising be recognized in the relevant quarter 
the value of the remaining cash flows from the octane additives business is calculated at any review date by reference to the best available estimates for future revenues  gross margins  selling and administrative costs as well as the fixed and working capital requirements of the business 
the resulting cash flows are then discounted and the total discounted cash flows of the octane additives business are then allocated to the fair value of the octane additives business unit at that date 
the company uses this information to derive an implied goodwill value which is then compared to the carrying value to determine what impairment is needed 
using this methodology and the assumptions underlying the detailed forecast model the company believes that it is possible to predict the pattern of likely future impairment charges of octane additives business goodwill 
this method reflects the relatively unique nature of the octane additives business 
as a result of the reviews performed during  and  respectively  impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  were recognized 
the company expects to recognize charges in subsequent years as the octane additives market continues to decline 
there is million of goodwill remaining which relates to the octane additives business 
at december  we had million of goodwill relating to our fuel specialties and performance chemicals businesses 
at this date we performed annual impairment reviews and concluded that there has been no impairment of goodwill in respect of those reporting segments 

table of contents intangible assets  net of amortization at december  we had million of intangibles that are discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these intangible assets relate to all of our businesses and are being amortized straight line over periods of up to years 
we continually assess the markets and products related to these intangibles  as well as their specific carrying values  and have concluded that these carrying values and amortization periods remain appropriate 
we also evaluate these intangibles for any potential impairment when events occur or circumstances change which suggest that an impairment may have occurred 
if events occur or circumstances change it may possibly cause a reduction in periods over which these intangibles are amortized or result in a non cash write off of a portion of the intangibles carrying value 
a reduction in amortization periods would have no effect on cash flows 
pensions the company s principal pension arrangement is a contributory defined benefit pension plan in the uk though it does also have other much smaller pension arrangements in the uk and overseas 
the company accounts for this pension plan in accordance with fas  employers accounting for pensions  fas  employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and fas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
at december  the underlying plan asset value and projected benefit obligation were million and million  respectively  resulting in a deficit of million 
this deficit  net of tax  was recognized on adoption of fas on december  and the prepaid pension cost  net of tax  transferred to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
further disclosure is provided in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements movements in the underlying plan asset value and projected benefit obligation are dependent on actual return on investments and pay awards as well as our assumptions in respect of the discount rate  annual member mortality rates  future return on assets  future pay escalation  future pension increases and future inflation 
we develop these assumptions after considering advice from a major global actuarial consulting firm 
a change in any one of these assumptions could impact the plan asset value  projected benefit obligation and pension cost recognized in the income statement 
such changes could impact our operating results and financial position 
a full actuarial valuation of the pension plan was carried out as at december  the results of this valuation have been reflected in these consolidated financial statements 
sales and marketing agreements the company has entered into a number of sales and marketing agreements with ethyl corporation ethyl to market and sell tel in all areas of the world except north america for the period to december   subject to renewal thereafter 
all marketing and sales effort made under the arrangement is made in the name of innospec 
innospec continues to 
table of contents produce all tel marketed under the agreements and also provide marketing and other services 
ethyl continues to provide marketing and other services 
the net proceeds under the agreements are paid to innospec and ethyl as compensation for services and are based on an agreed upon formula  with innospec receiving of the total compensation for services provided 
no separate legal entity or joint venture has been established as a consequence of the agreements 
sales and expenses incurred under the agreements are included within innospec s income statement 
these comprise all revenues and costs incurred directly by innospec  together with costs recharged by ethyl for marketing and other services provided under the terms of the agreements 
ethyl s share of the net proceeds for services is charged within cost of goods sold 
the majority of net proceeds are calculated and settled on a monthly basis but there is an element receivable by the company from ethyl which is computed annually in arrears 
in prior years the amounts involved were not significant but due to increases in the value of this retrospective element we decided effective january  that it was more appropriate to recognize an appropriate accrual during the year based on best current estimates of the expected outcome

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company operates manufacturing and blending facilities  offices and laboratories around the world  though the largest manufacturing facility is located in the uk the company sells a range of fuel specialties  performance chemicals and octane additives to customers around the world 
the company uses floating rate debt to finance these global operations 
consequently  the company is subject to business risks inherent in non us activities  including political and economic uncertainty  import and export limitations  and market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the political and economic risks are mitigated by the stability of the countries in which the company s largest operations are located 
credit limits  ongoing credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures are used to minimize bad debt risk 
collateral is not generally required 
the company uses derivatives  including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts  in the normal course of business to manage market risks 
the derivatives used in hedging activities are considered risk management tools and are not used for trading purposes 
in addition  the company enters into derivative instruments with a diversified group of major financial institutions in order to monitor the exposure to non performance of such instruments 
the company s objective in managing exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the impact of such changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower overall borrowing costs 
the company s objective in managing the exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates is to reduce volatility on earnings and cash flow associated with such changes 
interest rate risk the company uses interest swaps to manage interest rate exposure 
as of december  the company had cash and cash equivalents of million  no bank overdraft and long term debt of million 
the long term debt comprised million senior term loan  million revolving credit and million capital leases 
in january the company repaid million under the principal facility consisting of the scheduled million senior term loan repayment and million on the revolving credit facility 
in the company entered into interest swap agreements that cover million of the remaining term loan as at december  of million 
on the basis that million of the million long term debt  excluding capital leases  is hedged against interest movements and that the company would receive interest on the million positive cash balances  then unhedged debt of million is more than covered by the positive cash balances 
on a gross basis  assuming no additional interest on the cash balances  a hypothetical absolute change of in us base interest rate on the gross amount of these balances of million for a one year period would impact net income and cash flows by approximately million before tax 
the above does not consider the effect of interest or exchange rate changes on overall activity nor management action to mitigate such changes 

table of contents exchange rate risk approximately of the company s forecast sales for are denominated in us dollars with the balance mainly comprising euros over and sterling around 
the reporting currency of the company is the us dollar 
the company evaluates the functional currency of each reporting unit according to the economic environment in which it operates 
several major subsidiaries of the company operating outside of the us have the us dollar as their functional currency due to the nature of the markets in which they operate 
in the fuel specialties business more than of forecast sales are denominated in us dollars and more than in euros 
the fuel specialties business is reasonably well hedged against a strengthening in the us dollar against the euro 
for this reason such a shift in exchange rates  while reducing net sales  would increase operating income by around million for this business 
in the performance chemicals business approximately of forecast sales are denominated in euros with the remainder split between us dollars around and sterling around 
due mainly to the large operating profits denominated in euros a strengthening in the us dollar against both sterling and the euro would reduce operating profit by approximately million 
the octane additives market is predominantly a us dollar market although sales to certain territories are transacted in euros 
tel raw materials are purchased in a mixture of us dollars  sterling and euros 
ethyl compensation payments are denominated in us dollars 
selling  general and administrative expenses are generally in the currency of the legal entity with the majority being denominated in sterling 
a strengthening in the us dollar against both sterling and the euro would result in additional operating income of million due mainly to the lower burden of the sterling denominated cost of goods sold and operating expenses 
corporate costs are largely denominated in sterling 
a strengthening in the us dollar against both the euro and sterling would increase reported operating income by approximately million 
in all cases where a strengthening of the us dollar has been used as an illustration  a weakening would be expected to have the opposite effect on operating income
