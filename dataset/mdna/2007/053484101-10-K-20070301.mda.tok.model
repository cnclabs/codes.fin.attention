actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of the risk factors described in item a  risk factors  of this report 
overview business description we are primarily engaged in developing  acquiring  owning and operating apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the united states 
we seek to create long term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms  deploying that capital to develop  redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets  operating apartment communities  and selling communities when they no longer meet our long term investment strategy or when pricing is attractive 
we believe that apartment communities present an attractive long term investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle 
we intend to continue to pursue real estate investments in markets where constraints to new supply exist  and where new rental household formations are expected to out pace multifamily permit activity over the course of the real estate cycle 
barriers to entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply 
we regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets  which are located in the northeast  mid atlantic  midwest  pacific northwest  and northern and southern california regions of the united states 
our strategy is to more deeply penetrate these markets with a broad range of products and services and an intense focus on our customer 
a substantial majority of our communities are upscale  which generally command among the highest rents in their markets 
however  we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points  consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 
we believe that  over an entire real estate cycle  lower housing affordability and the limited new supply of apartment homes in our markets will result in a higher propensity to rent and larger revenue and cash flow increases relative to other markets 
however  throughout the real estate cycle  apartment market fundamentals  and therefore operating cash flows  are affected by overall economic conditions 
a number of our markets experienced economic contraction due to job losses in and  resulting in a prolonged period of weak apartment market fundamentals ie  the ratio of demand  including from new renter household formations  to supply as reflected in declining rental revenue and demand 
however  was a year of transition with apartment fundamentals further improving in and the economic upturn  as evidenced by job growth and declining unemployment claims  and modest increases in net supply  are contributing to the current strong apartment market fundamentals 
financial highlights and outlook strong apartment fundamentals in were evidenced by the year over year rental revenue growth of achieved within our established community portfolio as defined later in this report during the year ended december   comprised of an increase in rental rates of and an increase in occupancy of 
this revenue growth combined with constrained expense growth contributed to our established community portfolio achieving year over year growth in net operating income noi of in for the fourth quarter of  our established communities experienced an increase in rental revenue of and a corresponding increase in noi of over the prior year period  our strongest operating performance since we expect the positive revenue and net operating income growth of established communities to continue in but at a more moderate pace 
modest net new supply  low home affordability and continued but moderating job growth should support favorable apartment fundamentals 
we expect modest increases in net rental supply in our markets in that will remain below the national average 
the single family housing market continues to moderate  such that the increase in home prices is flat or down and for sale inventory has increased 
however  the current gap between the cost to rent and the cost to own continues to make rental apartments an economically attractive housing alternative in our markets 
these recent trends increase the likelihood that potential home buyers will extend the period they rent a home 
finally  we expect that job growth will continue in our markets  however  at a more modest rate in accordingly  we expect apartment market fundamentals to remain strong in our markets such that apartment rental demand will outpace new supply 
our current financial outlook provides for rental revenue growth of to in our established community portfolio in  and projected noi growth of to 
in positioning for future growth  we have increased our development activity and our investments in development rights  as discussed below 
we currently have in excess of  under construction measured by total projected capitalized cost of the communities at completion  including the portions in which joint venture partners hold an equity or economic interest 
for  we expect additional new development activity to be in the range of  to  in addition  we continue to secure new development rights  including the acquisition of land for future development 
we currently have development rights for construction of new apartment communities that  based on total projected capitalized cost if developed as expected  total approximately  we continue to look for opportunities to acquire existing communities through our investment in and management of a discretionary investment fund the fund  in which the company holds an interest of approximately 
during its investment period which will end on or before march   the fund will be our principal vehicle for acquiring apartment communities  subject to certain exceptions 
the fund acquired five communities for an aggregate purchase price of  during and has approximately  under contract for acquisition in early as of january   the total amount invested by the fund is  we expect the fund to continue to focus on acquisition opportunities where value can be created  generally through redevelopment  repositioning and market cycle timing opportunities 
real estate capital flows remain strong  with income investors seeking to acquire existing apartment communities 
as a result  opportunities to realize value upon disposition have continued to be available 
in  we sold four communities one through a joint venture for an aggregate sales price of  resulting in a gain in accordance with gaap of  we expect asset sales of approximately  to  in for new development  the slowing for sale market has resulted in increased investment opportunities 
we are being selective in pursuing these opportunities  given continued high land prices and construction costs 
in addition  we are seeing greater availability of experienced subcontractors and development and construction professionals as a result of slowing construction in both the condominium and single family housing markets 
these positives are somewhat offset by higher construction and development costs 
communities overview our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities  communities in various stages of development development communities and development rights ie  land or options to purchase land held for development  as further described in item of this report 
our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities  other stabilized communities  lease up communities and redevelopment communities 
established communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year  which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years 
other stabilized communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year  but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year 
lease up communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved 
redevelopment communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year 
a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note  segment reporting  of our consolidated financial statements 
although each of these categories is important to our business  we generally evaluate overall operating  industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities  for which a detailed discussion can be found in results of operations as part of our discussion of overall operating results 
we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition  disposition  development  redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized  redevelopment and development communities  and discussions related to these segments of our business can be found in liquidity and capital resources 
the net operating income of our current operating communities  as defined later in this report  is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance 
net operating income is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets  our rental rates and occupancy levels  and our ability to control operating costs 
our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed and acquired apartment communities 
as of december   we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in apartment communities containing  apartment homes in ten states and the district of columbia  of which communities were under construction and six communities were under reconstruction 
in addition  we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional communities that  if developed in the manner expected  will contain an estimated  apartment homes 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  or different estimates or assumptions had been made  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied  resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements 
below is a discussion of a number of accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain 
a discussion of our significant accounting policies  including further discussion of the accounting policies described below  can be found in note  organization and significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements 
cost capitalization we capitalize costs during the development of assets including interest and related loan fees  property taxes and other direct and indirect costs beginning when development efforts commence until the asset  or a portion of the asset  is delivered and is ready for its intended use  which is generally indicated by the issuance of a certificate of occupancy 
we capitalize costs during redevelopment of apartment homes including interest and related loan fees  property taxes and other direct and indirect costs beginning when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment until the apartment home redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident 
rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease up or post redevelopment lease up period are fully recognized as they accrue 
we capitalize pre development costs incurred in pursuit of development rights for which we currently believe future development is probable 
these costs include legal fees  design fees and related overhead costs 
future development of these development rights is dependent upon various factors  including zoning and regulatory approval  rental market conditions  construction costs and availability of capital 
pre development costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred 
in addition  if the status of a development right changes  making future development no longer probable  any capitalized pre development costs are written off with a charge to expense 
we generally capitalize only non recurring expenditures 
we capitalize improvements and upgrades only if the item i exceeds  ii extends the useful life of the asset  and iii is not related to making an apartment home ready for the next resident 
under this policy  a significant portion of our capitalized costs are non recurring  as recurring make ready costs are expensed as incurred 
recurring make ready costs include i carpet and appliance replacements  ii floor coverings  iii interior painting  and iv other redecorating costs 
because we expense recurring make ready costs  such as carpet replacements  our expense levels and volatility are greatest in the third quarter of each year as this is when we experience our greatest amount of turnover 
we capitalize purchases of personal property  such as computers and furniture  only if the item is a new addition and the item exceeds  we generally expense replacements of personal property 
in  and  the amounts capitalized excluding land costs related to acquisitions  development and redevelopment were   and  respectively 
for established and other stabilized communities  we recorded non revenue generating capital expenditures of  or per apartment home in   or per apartment home in and  or per apartment home in in addition  revenue generating  or expense saving capital expenditures  such as water sub metering equipment and cable installations  were   and  in  and  respectively 
the average maintenance costs charged to expense per apartment home  including carpet and appliance replacements  related to these communities was  in   in and  in historically  we have experienced a gradual increase in capitalized costs and expensed maintenance costs per apartment home as the average age of our communities has increased 
we expect to return to the trend of gradual increases in maintenance costs in future years 
asset impairment evaluation we assess the impairment of our investments and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for both our consolidated and unconsolidated entities  factors that could trigger an assessment for impairment include  but are not limited to i underperformance of the asset relative to historical or expected future operating results  ii significant change in legal and economic factors  iii incurrence of costs significantly in excess of amounts originally forecasted for construction or acquisition of an asset  or iv an expectation that a long lived asset will be disposed of at an amount below the current carrying value 
we evaluate the key factors necessary in the assessment of asset impairment on a quarterly basis 
in  and  we did not recognize any impairment in value associated with our investments or long lived assets 
we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed 
reit status we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated  for federal income tax purposes  as a reit 
we elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of the code  as amended  for the year ended december  and have not revoked such election 
a corporate reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that it currently distribute at least of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute of taxable income over time periods allowed under the code to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to elect to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years 
results of operations our year over year operating performance is primarily affected by changes in net operating income of our current operating apartment communities due to market conditions  net operating income derived from acquisitions and development completions  the loss of net operating income related to disposed communities  and capital market  disposition and financing activity 
a comparison of our operating results for the years  and follows dollars in thousands change change change change revenue rental and other income management  development and other fees total revenue expenses direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes property taxes total community operating expenses corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses investments and investment management interest expense  net depreciation expense general and administrative expense total other expenses equity in income of unconsolidated entities  n a venture partner interest in profit sharing n a   minority interest in consolidated partnerships  n a gain on sale of land income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle discontinued operations income from discontinued operations gain on sale of communities total discontinued operations income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle n a   n a net income dividends attributable to preferred stock net income available to common stockholders net income available to common stockholders decreased  or  to  in this decrease is primarily attributable to reduced asset sales and related gains in  partially offset by growth in net operating income from established communities and contributions to net operating income from newly developed communities 
net income available to common stockholders increased  or  to  in this increase is primarily attributable to higher gains on sales of assets in  including the gain related to the sale of a technology investment  as well as increased net operating income from established communities and newly developed communities 
net operating income noi is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate level or financing related costs 
noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets 
in addition  because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures  with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate  noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets 
we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses  including property taxes 
noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
therefore  noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance 
noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities  as determined by gaap  as a measure of liquidity  nor is noi necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
a calculation of noi for the years ended december   and  along with a reconciliation to net income for each year  is as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended net income indirect operating expenses  net of corporate income investments and investment management interest expense  net general and administrative expense equity in income of unconsolidated entities minority interest in consolidated partnerships venture partner interest in profit sharing depreciation expense cumulative effect of change in accounting principle gain on sale of real estate assets income from discontinued operations net operating income the noi increases in both and as compared to the prior years  consist of changes in the following categories dollars in thousands increase increase established communities other stabilized communities development and redevelopment communities total the noi increase in established communities in was largely due to the improved apartment market fundamentals 
during  we focused on rental rate growth  while maintaining occupancy of at least in all regions 
we will continue to seek increases in rental rates 
however we anticipate that increases in rental rates and overall rental revenue growth may moderate in  as we expect continued but moderating job growth demand and increased net supply as compared to recent periods 
we expect revenue growth from our established communities of to in as compared to in addition  although we will continue to aggressively manage operating expenses  there is upward pressure on operating expenses from increasing utility  labor  insurance and property tax expenses 
we expect operating expenses at our established communities to increase by to in as compared to overall  we anticipate growth in noi from our established communities of to in as compared to the company has given projected noi growth in only for established communities and not on a company wide basis 
the company believes that noi growth of the established communities assists investors in understanding management s estimate of the likely contribution to operations from established communities 
however  the company has not provided a projection of noi growth on a company wide basis due to the difficulty in projecting the timing of new development starts  dispositions and acquisitions  as well as the complexities involved in projecting the allocation of corporate level property management overhead  general and administrative costs and interest expense to communities not yet developed  disposed or acquired 
noi growth expected from established communities is not a projection of the company s projected consolidated financial performance or projected cash flow 
rental and other income increased in due to increased rental rates and occupancy for our established communities  coupled with additional rental income generated from newly developed communities 
we expect the strong apartment fundamentals experienced in to continue in  but at a more moderate pace 
overall portfolio the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to  apartment homes for as compared to  apartment homes for and  apartment homes for this change is primarily the result of an increase in the overall occupancy rate and increased homes available from newly developed and acquired communities  partially offset by communities sold in and the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to  in as compared to  in and  in established communities rental revenue increased  or  in and increased  or  in the increases in and are due to both increased rental rates and increased economic occupancy as compared to the prior years 
for  the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to  compared to  in  primarily due to increased market rents and decreased concessions 
the average economic occupancy increased from in to in economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community s gross revenue 
economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss  as a percentage of gross potential revenue 
gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents 
we expect rental revenue from established communities to increase to in as compared to we experienced increases in established communities rental revenue in all six of our regions in as compared to the largest increases in rental revenue were in the pacific northwest  the mid atlantic and northern california  with increases of  and  respectively  between years 
the northeast and northern california regions comprise the majority of our established community revenue  and therefore are discussed in more detail below 
northern california  which represented approximately of established community rental revenue during  experienced an increase in rental revenue of in as compared to average rental rates increased by to  in  and economic occupancy increased to in apartment fundamentals improved in northern california in  resulting in accelerated revenue growth in this region 
we expect northern california to see continued revenue growth in the northeast region  which accounted for approximately of established community rental revenue during  experienced an increase in rental revenue of in as compared to average rental rates increased to  in and economic occupancy increased to during we expect job growth in to increase slightly over the growth levels experienced in in the northeast and net supply to increase 
however  we expect overall apartment fundamentals will remain favorable  resulting in moderate rental rate growth in the northeast during the company believes that northern new jersey will lead the region in revenue growth as a result of the strong apartment fundamentals in neighboring new york city 
we expect boston  massachusetts will lag the region in revenue growth  as economic recovery is not occurring as quickly as in other areas of the region 
in accordance with gaap  cash concessions are amortized as an offset to rental revenue over the approximate lease term  which is generally one year 
as a supplemental measure  we also present rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on gaap based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies 
rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis also allows investors to understand historical trends in cash concessions  as well as current rental market conditions 
the following table reconciles total rental revenue in conformity with gaap to total rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis for our established communities for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands 
information for the year ended december  is not presented  as established community classification is not comparable prior to january  see note  segment reporting  of our consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended rental revenue gaap basis concessions amortized concessions granted rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis year over year change gaap revenue n a year over year change cash concession based revenue n a management  development and other fees increased in and due to increased asset management  property management and redevelopment fees earned from the fund 
the fund was formed in march  and continues to grow through purchases  acquiring five more communities in in addition  construction and development fees earned from unconsolidated entities in and contributed to increased fee income 
direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes increased in both and  primarily due to the addition of recently developed and acquired apartment homes coupled with expense growth in our established communities 
for established communities  direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes  increased  or  to  in due primarily to increases in payroll  maintenance and utility costs  partially offset by decreases in marketing and office and administration expenses 
during  direct property operating expenses increased  or  to  in due primarily to increases in utility  maintenance and payroll costs  partially offset by decreases in marketing and bad debt expenses 
we expect operating expenses for established communities to increase by to in as compared to  primarily as a result of continued higher utility and payroll costs  as well as increased insurance costs 
property taxes increased in both and due to overall higher assessments and the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes  and are impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals in both years 
for established communities  property taxes increased by  or  in and  or  in  due to overall higher assessments throughout all regions and are impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals in both years 
we expect property taxes to continue to increase in as compared to to reflect increased valuations 
however  property tax increases are mitigated for communities in california  where increases in property taxes are limited by law proposition 
we evaluate property tax increases internally  as well as engage third party consultants  and appeal increases when appropriate 
corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses increased in both and due to increased compensation  as well as increased costs relating to corporate initiatives focused on increasing efficiency and enhancing controls at our operating communities 
investments and investment management reflects the costs incurred related to investment acquisitions  investment management and abandoned pursuit costs  which include costs incurred on development pursuits not yet considered probable for development  as well as the abandonment or impairment of development pursuits  acquisition pursuits and disposition pursuits 
investments and investment management increased in as compared to due primarily to increased compensation costs and increased staffing related to management of the fund redevelopment activity  coupled with an increase in abandoned pursuit costs 
abandoned pursuit costs were  in   in and  in abandoned pursuit costs can be volatile  and the costs incurred in any given period may vary significantly in future years 
interest expense  net decreased in as compared to due primarily to higher levels of capitalized interest in connection with our increased development activity  lower average outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility and increased interest income 
in addition  through a maturity and the subsequent issuance of unsecured notes  we reduced the effective annual interest rate on  of debt by approximately 
these decreases in interest expense are partially offset by higher interest rates on variable rate debt in and the timing of the repayment and re issuance of unsecured debt in interest income increased in due to higher invested cash balances as well as increases in the interest rate earned on cash deposits 
in addition  interest income in includes interest earned on an escrow funded from a disposition in that was used in a tax deferred exchange 
depreciation expense increased in both and primarily due to the completion of development and redevelopment activities  coupled with the timing of depreciation expense for a community previously classified as held for sale 
general and administrative expense g a decreased in and increased in relative to the prior years primarily due to the incurrence in of the following i separation costs of approximately  due to the departure of a senior executive  ii the accrual of costs related to various litigation matters of approximately  and iii increased board of director fees due to the acceleration of equity awards with the resignation of a director due to disability in  partially offset by higher compensation costs in we expect expensed overhead costs  including g a  corporate level property management and investments and investment management  to increase approximately to in as compared to in support of the company s continued growth 
equity in income of unconsolidated entities in includes our share of gain on the sale of a joint venture community in the amount of  and the release of amounts previously withheld in escrow allowing recognition of the final installment of the gain from the sale of our investment in rent 
com to ebay in the amount of  equity in income of unconsolidated entities in includes the initial gain recognized in the amount of  related to the sale of our investment in rent 
com to ebay 
minority interest in consolidated partnerships decreased in as compared to due to the conversion of limited partnership units  thereby reducing outside ownership interests and the allocation of net income to outside ownership interests 
however  minority interest increased in due to the consolidation of an entity under fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 as revised in december effective january   we consolidated an entity from which we held a participating mortgage note in accordance with fin we did not hold an equity interest in this entity  and therefore of the entity s net loss was recognized as minority interest in consolidated partnerships during the year ended december  in october  we received payment in full of the outstanding mortgage note due from this entity 
upon repayment of the mortgage note  our economic interest in this entity ended  and therefore we discontinued consolidation as this entity was no longer considered a variable interest entity under fin gain on sale of land in represents the gain on sale of three land parcels located in danvers  massachusetts  jersey city  new jersey and stamford  connecticut 
during  we sold three land parcels  one located in dublin  california  one in madison  washington  and one in freehold  new jersey 
income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold during the period from january  through december  see note  real estate disposition activities  of our consolidated financial statements 
the decreases in and are due to the sale of three consolidated communities in  seven communities and one office building in and five communities in  eliminating the income generated from the assets upon disposition 
gain on sale of real estate assets decreased in as compared to primarily due to the volume and size of dispositions  coupled with the carrying value of the communities sold 
gain on sale of real estate assets increased in and decreased in due to the volume and size of dispositions in each year 
the amount of gain realized in any given reporting period depends on many factors  including the number of communities sold  the size and carrying value of those communities and the sales price  which are driven by local and national market conditions 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in is a result of the implementation of fin  discussed above  and represents the difference between the net assets consolidated under fin and the previously recorded net assets 
funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ffo ffo is considered by management to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance 
in calculating ffo  we exclude gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and exclude real estate depreciation 
these amounts are generally excluded in the industry definition of ffo as amounts can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates 
ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies 
we believe that in order to understand our operating results  ffo should be examined with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements 
for a more detailed discussion and presentation of ffo  see selected financial data  included in item of this report 
liquidity and capital resources factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations  financing activities and investing activities  as well as general economic and market conditions 
operating cash flow has historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned  ii rental rates  iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes 
the timing  source and amount of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment  particularly to changes in interest rates 
the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage  as well as our plans for development  redevelopment  acquisition and disposition activity  are affected by changes in the capital markets environment  such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost effective capital 
we regularly review our liquidity needs  the adequacy of cash flows from operations  and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 
we believe our principal short term liquidity needs are to fund normal recurring operating expenses  debt service and maturity payments  preferred stock dividends and downreit partnership unit distributions  the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our reit qualification under the internal revenue code of development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged  and capital calls for the fund  as required 
we anticipate that we can fully satisfy these needs from a combination of cash flow provided by operating activities  proceeds from asset dispositions and borrowing capacity under our variable rate unsecured credit facility  as well as other public or private sources of liquidity 
cash and cash equivalents totaled  at december   an increase of  from  at december  the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating  investing and financing activities  which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased to  in from  in the increase was driven primarily by the additional noi from our established communities operations  as well as noi from recently developed communities  partially offset by the loss of noi from the four communities sold in  as discussed earlier in this report 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities of  in related to investments in assets through the development redevelopment and acquisition of apartment communities  partially offset by proceeds from asset dispositions 
during  we invested  in the purchase and development of the following real estate and capital expenditures we began the development of eight new communities 
these eight communities  if developed as expected  will contain a total of  apartment homes  and the total capitalized cost  including land acquisition costs  is projected to be approximately  we completed the development of six communities containing a total of  apartment homes for a total capitalized cost  including land acquisition cost  of  we began the redevelopment of three consolidated communities  which contain an aggregate of  apartment homes and  if redeveloped as expected  will be completed for a total redevelopment capitalized cost of  excluding costs incurred prior to redevelopment 
we completed the redevelopment of one consolidated community containing apartment homes for a total capitalized cost of  excluding costs incurred prior to redevelopment 
we acquired nine parcels of land in connection with development rights  for an aggregate purchase price of  we had capital expenditures relating to current communities real estate assets of  and non real estate capital expenditures of  we disposed of four communities one through a joint venture for an aggregate sales price of  and a total gain in accordance with gaap of  we also disposed of three parcels of land for an aggregate sales price of  and a total gain in accordance with gaap of  in addition  we received proceeds in the amount of  from the sale of a interest in our investments in avalon del rey apartments  llc 
for further discussion see note  investments in unconsolidated entities  included in item of this report 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities totaled  in the net cash inflow is due primarily to the proceeds from  of unsecured notes that we issued in september  partially offset by the  of unsecured notes that was repaid upon maturity in july in addition  net cash provided by financing activities includes the issuance of common stock for option exercises and the issuance of secured mortgage loans  partially offset by dividends paid and repayment of borrowings under our unsecured credit facility 
see note  notes payable  unsecured notes and credit facility  and note  stockholders equity  of our consolidated financial statements  for additional information 
variable rate unsecured credit facility we entered into a  revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks 
jpmorgan chase bank  wachovia bank  na and bank of america  na led the syndication effort in varying capacities 
under the terms of the credit facility  we may elect to increase the facility up to  provided that one or more banks from the syndicate or otherwise voluntarily agree to provide the additional commitment 
no member of the syndicate of banks can prohibit such an increase  such an increase in the facility will only be effective to the extent banks from the syndicate or otherwise choose to commit to lend additional funds 
we pay participating banks  in the aggregate  an annual facility fee of approximately  the unsecured credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate libor  our credit rating and on a maturity schedule selected by us 
the current stated pricing is libor plus per annum on january  
the spread over libor can vary from libor plus to libor plus based on our credit rating 
in addition  a competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to  this option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the unsecured credit facility 
the competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow 
we had no outstanding balance under this competitive bid option at january  we are subject to certain customary covenants under the unsecured credit facility  including  but not limited to  maintaining certain maximum leverage ratios  a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio and minimum unencumbered assets and equity levels 
the credit facility matures in november  assuming our exercise of a one year renewal option 
at january   no amounts were outstanding on the credit facility   was used to provide letters of credit and  was available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility 
future financing and capital needs debt maturities one of our principal long term liquidity needs is the repayment of long term debt at the time that such debt matures 
for unsecured notes  we anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of these notes will be repaid prior to maturity 
if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due  it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt 
this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings  additional debt financing that is collateralized by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities  draws on our unsecured credit facility or by additional equity offerings 
although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our long term liquidity needs  we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or  if available  that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory

financed by variable rate  tax exempt debt  but the interest rate on a portion of this debt is effectively fixed at december  and december  through a swap agreement 
the portion of the debt fixed through a swap agreement decreases and therefore the variable portion of the debt increases monthly as payments are made to a principal reserve fund

balances outstanding represent total amounts due at maturity  and are not net of  and of debt discount as of december  and december   respectively  as reflected in unsecured notes on our consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere in this report 
future financing and capital needs portfolio and other activity as of december   we had new communities under construction  for which a total estimated cost of  remained to be invested 
in addition  we had six communities which we own  or in which we have a direct or indirect interest  under reconstruction  for which a total estimated cost of  remained to be invested 
substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction  as well as development costs related to pursuing development rights  will be funded from cash currently on hand invested in highly liquid overnight money market funds and repurchase agreements  the remaining capacity under our current  unsecured credit facility  the net proceeds from sales of existing communities  retained operating cash  the issuance of debt or equity securities including proceeds from the recent stock offering  and or private equity funding 
before planned reconstruction activity  including reconstruction activity related to communities acquired by the fund as discussed below  or the construction of a development right begins  we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings  although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing 
in the event that financing cannot be obtained  we may have to abandon development rights  write off associated pre development costs that were capitalized and or forego reconstruction activity 
in such instances  we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred 
we have invested in the fund  a private  discretionary investment vehicle that acquires and operates apartment communities in our markets 
the fund will serve  until march  or until of its committed capital is invested  as the principal vehicle through which we will invest in the acquisition of apartment communities  subject to certain exceptions 
these exceptions include significant individual asset and portfolio acquisitions  properties acquired in tax deferred transactions and acquisitions that are inadvisable or inappropriate for the fund 
the fund will not restrict our development activities  and will terminate after a term of eight years  subject to two one year extensions 
the fund has nine institutional investors  including us  with a combined equity capital commitment of  a significant portion of the investments made in the fund by its investors are being made through avalonbay value added fund  inc  a maryland corporation that qualifies as a reit under the internal revenue code the fund reit 
a wholly owned subsidiary of the company is the general partner of the fund and has committed  to the fund and the fund reit of which approximately  has been invested as of january  representing a combined general partner and limited partner equity interest 
under the fund documents  the fund has the ability to employ leverage through debt financings up to on a portfolio basis  which  if achieved  would enable the fund to invest up to  of which approximately  has been invested as of january  
we currently expect that leverage of less than will be employed  reducing the projected investment value to between  and from time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets 
we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk or secondarily as a source of liquidity 
we may also use joint ventures related to mixed use land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture 
each joint venture or partnership agreement has been and will continue to be individually negotiated  and our ability to operate and or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement 
however  we cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures 
in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets  we sell assets that do not meet our long term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities 
in response to real estate and capital markets conditions  we sold four communities  including an investment held in a joint venture  with net proceeds in the aggregate of approximately  from january  through january  because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets  the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income  but reduce future total revenues  total expenses and noi 
however  we believe that the absence of future cash flows from communities sold will have a minimal impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs 
off balance sheet arrangements in addition to the investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities  we have certain off balance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest 
additional discussion of these entities can be found in note  investments in unconsolidated entities  and note  commitments and contingencies  of our consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report 
cvp i  llc cvp i  llc has outstanding tax exempt  variable rate bonds maturing in november in the amount of  which have permanent credit enhancement 
we have agreed to guarantee  under limited circumstances  the repayment to the credit enhancer of any advances it may make in fulfillment of cvp i  llc s repayment obligations under the bonds 
we have also guaranteed to the credit enhancer that cvp i  llc will obtain a final certificate of occupancy for the project chrystie place in new york city overall once tenant improvements related to a retail tenant are complete  which is expected in our partner in this venture has agreed that it will reimburse us its pro rata share of any amounts paid relative to these guaranteed obligations 
the estimated fair value of  and our obligation under these guarantees  both at inception and as of december  were not significant 
as a result we have not recorded any obligation associated with these guarantees at december  mvp i  llc mvp i  llc has a construction loan in the amount of  of which  is outstanding as of december   which matures in september  assuming exercise of two one year renewal options  and is payable by the unconsolidated real estate entity 
in connection with the construction management services that we provided to mvp i  llc  the entity that owns and developed avalon at mission bay north ii in san francisco  we have provided a construction completion guarantee to the lender in order to fulfill their standard financing requirements related to the construction financing 
construction was completed in  and our obligations under this guarantee will terminate once all of the lender s standard completion requirements have been satisfied  which we currently expect to occur in the estimated fair value of and our obligation under this guarantee  both at inception and as of december  was not significant and therefore no liability has been recorded related to this construction completion guarantee as of december  the fund the fund has mortgage loans with amounts outstanding in the aggregate of  these mortgage loans have varying maturity dates or dates after which the loans can be prepaid  ranging from february to october these mortgage loans are secured by the underlying real estate 
in addition  the fund has a credit facility with  outstanding as of december   which matures in january the mortgage loans and the credit facility are payable by the fund with operating cash flow from the underlying real estate  and the credit facility is secured by capital commitments 
we have not guaranteed the debt of the fund  nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the fund be unable to do so 
in addition  as part of the formation of the fund  we have provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee 
the guarantee provides that if  upon final liquidation of the fund  the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of the fund whether from operating cash flow or property sales does not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner  then we will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall  but in no event more than of the total capital contributions made by the partner maximum of approximately  as of december  
as of december   the fair value of the real estate assets owned by the fund is considered adequate to cover such potential payment to that partner under a liquidation scenario 
the estimated fair value of  and our obligation under this guarantee  both at inception and as of december  was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of december  phvp i  llc in connection with the pursuit of a development right in pleasant hill  california   in bond financing was issued by the contra costa county redevelopment agency the agency in connection with the possible future construction of a multifamily rental community by phvp i  llc 
the bond proceeds were immediately invested in their entirety in a guaranteed investment contract gic administered by a trustee 
this development right is planned as a mixed use development  with residential  for sale  retail and office components 
the bond proceeds will remain in the gic until at least june   but no later than december   at which time a loan will be made to phvp i  llc to fund construction of the multifamily portion of the development  or the bonds will be redeemed by the agency 
although we do not have any equity or economic interest in phvp i  llc at this time  we do have an option to make a capital contribution to phvp i  llc in exchange for a general partner interest in the entity 
should we decide not to exercise this option  the bonds will be redeemed  and a loan will not be made to phvp i  llc 
the bonds are payable from the proceeds of the gic and are non recourse to both phvp i  llc and to us 
there is no loan payable outstanding by phvp i  llc as of december  in addition  as part of providing construction management services to phvp i  llc for the construction of a public garage  we have provided a construction completion guarantee to the related lender in order to fulfill their standard financing requirements related to the garage construction financing 
our obligations under this guarantee will terminate following construction completion of the garage once all of the lender s standard completion requirements have been satisfied  which we currently expect to occur in in the third quarter of  significant modifications were requested by the local transit authority to change the garage structure design 
we do not believe that the requested design changes impact the construction schedule 
however  it is expected that these changes will increase the original budget by an amount up to  we believe that substantially all potential additional amounts are reimbursable from unrelated third parties 
at this time we do not believe that it is probable that we will incur any additional costs 
the estimated fair value of  and our obligation under this guarantee  both at inception and as of december  was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of december  avalon del rey apartments  llc in the fourth quarter of  we admitted a venture partner to the llc for an investment of  including the assumption of debt 
in conjunction with this investment  we provided an operating guarantee to the joint venture partner 
this guarantee provides that if the initial year return earned by the joint venture partner is less than a threshold return of on its initial equity investment  we will pay the joint venture partner an amount equal to the shortfall  up to the threshold return required 
as of december   the cash flows and expected return on investment of the community are expected to meet and exceed the initial year threshold return required by our joint venture partner 
therefore we have not recorded any liability associated with this guarantee as of december  there are no other lines of credit  side agreements  financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between us and our unconsolidated real estate entities 
in evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage  management takes into consideration our proportionate share of this unconsolidated debt 
contractual obligations we currently have contractual obligations consisting primarily of long term debt obligations and lease obligations for certain land parcels and regional and administrative office space 
scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations total no balance outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as of december  amounts exclude interest payable as of december  includes land leases expiring between july and march amounts do not include any adjustment for purchase options available under the land leases 
inflation and deflation substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less 
in an inflationary environment  this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases 
short term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation  although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents 
in a deflationary rent environment  we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter term leases

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain financial market risks  the most predominant being interest rate risk 
we monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management program  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations 
the effect of interest rate fluctuations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results  such as rental rates and occupancy 
the specific market risks and the potential impact on our operating results are described below 
our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as well as outstanding bonds with variable interest rates 
we had  and  in variable rate debt outstanding excluding variable rate debt effectively fixed through swap agreements as of december  and  respectively 
if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been basis points higher throughout and  our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately  and  respectively  based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 
we currently use interest rate protection agreements consisting of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate indebtedness  not for trading on speculative purposes 
under swap agreements we agree to pay to a counterparty the interest that would have been incurred on a fixed principal amount at a fixed interest rate generally  the interest rate on a particular treasury bond on the date the agreement is entered into  plus a fixed increment  and the counterparty agrees to pay to us the interest that would have been incurred on the same principal amount at an assumed floating interest rate tied to a particular market index 
as of december   the effect of swap agreements is to fix the interest rate on approximately  of our variable rate  tax exempt debt 
the interest rate protection provided by certain swap agreements on the consolidated variable rate  tax exempt debt was not electively entered into by us but  rather  was a requirement of either the bond issuer or the credit enhancement provider related to certain tax exempt bond financings 
had these swap agreements not been in place during and  our annual interest costs would have been approximately  and  lower  respectively  based on balances outstanding and reported interest rates during the applicable years 
additionally  if the variable interest rates on this debt had been basis points higher throughout and and these swap agreements had not been in place  our annual interest costs would have been approximately  higher in and  lower in because the counterparties providing the swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard poor s ratings group and the interest rates fixed by the swap agreements are significantly higher than current market rates for such agreements  we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider 
in addition  changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt  which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness 
debt securities and notes payable excluding amounts outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility with an aggregate carrying value of  at december  had an estimated aggregate fair value of  at december  fixed rate debt excluding our variable rate debt effectively fixed through swap agreements represented  of the carrying value and  of the fair value at december  if interest rates had been basis points higher as of december   the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by we do not have any exposure to foreign currency or equity price risk  and our exposure to commodity price risk is insignificant
