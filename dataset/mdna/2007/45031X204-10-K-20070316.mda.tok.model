the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are an ophthalmic pharmaceutical company 
our products and product candidates address the billion us prescription ophthalmic market and include therapies for inflammation  ocular pain  glaucoma  allergy  dry eye  vitreous hemorrhage  and diabetic retinopathy 
we currently have three products for sale in the us xibrom bromfenac sodium ophthalmic solution for the treatment of inflammation and pain following cataract surgery  istalol timolol maleate ophthalmic solution for the treatment of glaucoma  and vitrase hyaluronidase for injection for use as a spreading agent 
we also have several product candidates in various stages of development 
we have incurred losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit of million through december  
table of contents results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations generally reflects our transition from a development stage company to a commercial stage company with a primary focus on ophthalmology 
years ended december   and revenue 
revenue was approximately million in  as compared to million in and million in the increase in revenue in as compared to was primarily attributable to a full year of product sales for all three of our commercial products  including the launch of smaller vial sizes for both xibrom and istalol during the first quarter of the increase in revenue in as compared to was primarily attributable to the launch of vitrase and xibrom in the first and second quarters of  respectively 
in addition to product revenues in  and  we recorded license revenue of  in each of  and  reflecting the amortization of deferred revenue recorded in december for the license fee payment made by otsuka pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
in connection with the license of vitrase in japan for ophthalmic uses in the posterior region of the eye 
net revenue millions year ended december  year ended december  change xibrom istalol vitrase other total net revenue cost of products sold 
cost of products sold was million in  as compared to million in and million in cost of products sold for consisted primarily of standard costs for each of our commercial products  distribution costs  royalties  inventory reserves for short dating of certain vitrase lots and other costs of products sold 
the increase in cost of products sold in from is primarily the result of increased net product sales year over year 
the increase in cost of products sold in from was primarily the result of increased net product sales after the launch of our new products in gross margin for was  or million  as compared to  or million for and  or 
million for the increase in gross margin in as compared to and is primarily due to the change in revenue mix 
we expect our gross margin for will be approximately  subject to quarterly fluctuations based on revenue mix 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in the increase in research and development expenses for was primarily the result of an increase in clinical development costs  which include fda filing fees  clinical investigator fees  study monitoring costs and data management costs due to the filing of an nda with the fda for t pred  the commencement and completion of the xibrom qd once daily phase iii clinical trials  as well as the commencement of our phase iii clinical trial for xibrom allergy and phase iib confirmatory study for ecabet sodium 
our research and development expenses to date have consisted primarily of costs associated with the clinical trials of our product candidates  compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  costs for consultants and contract research organizations and costs related to the development of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities for vitrase  istalol and xibrom 
generally  our research and development resources are not dedicated to a single project but are applied to multiple product candidates in our portfolio 
as a result  we manage and evaluate our research and development expenditures generally by the type of costs incurred 
we generally classify and separate research and development expenditures into amounts related to clinical development costs  regulatory costs  pharmaceutical development costs  manufacturing development costs  medical affairs costs 
in addition  we also record as research and development expenses any up front and milestone payments that have accrued to third parties 
table of contents prior to regulatory approval of a product candidate under our licensing agreements unless there is an alternative future use 
in  approximately of our research and development expenditures were for clinical development costs  were for regulatory costs  were for pharmaceutical development costs  were for manufacturing development costs  were for medical affairs costs and approximately was for an up front payment to in license bepotastine  an investigational ophthalmic treatment for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis 
changes in our research and development expenses are primarily due to the following clinical development costs overall clinical costs  which include clinical investigator fees  study monitoring costs and data management  for were million as compared to million for or an increase of million 
the increase in clinical costs in was primarily due to the commencement and completion of the xibrom qd once daily phase iii clinical trials  as well as the commencement of the phase ii clinical trial for xibrom allergy and phase iib confirmatory study for ecabet sodium 
regulatory costs regulatory costs  which include compliance expense for existing products and other activity for pipeline projects  for were million as compared to million for or an increase of  the increase is primarily attributable to the filing of an nda with the fda for t pred 
pharmaceutical development costs pharmaceutical development costs  which include costs related to the testing and development of our pipeline products  for were million as compared to million for or a decrease of  the decrease is primarily due to the overall reduction in outside research expenses 
manufacturing development costs manufacturing development costs  which include costs related to production scale up and validation  raw material qualification  and stability studies  for were million as compared to million for or an increase of million 
the increase is primarily attributable to the scale up of activities associated with the increase in the number of commercial products during as compared to and the continued increase in the number of products in our pipeline 
medical affairs costs medical affairs costs  which include activities that relate to medical information in support of our products  for remained relatively flat as compared to at million 
our research and development activities reflect our efforts to advance our product candidates through the various stages of product development 
the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our development plans are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may affect our research and development expenditures and capital resources 
for instance  the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly depending on a variety of factors including a trial s protocol  the number of patients in the trial  the duration of patient follow up  the number of clinical sites in the trial  and the length of time required enrolling suitable patient subjects 
even if earlier results are positive  we may obtain different results in later stages of development  including failure to show the desired safety or efficacy  which could impact our development expenditures for a particular product candidate 
although we spend a considerable amount of time planning our development activities  we may be required to alter from our plan based on new circumstances or events or our assessment from time to time of a product candidate s market potential  other product opportunities and our corporate priorities 
any deviation from our plan may require us to incur additional expenditures or accelerate or delay the timing of our development spending 
furthermore  as we obtain results from trials and review the path toward regulatory approval  we may elect to discontinue development of certain product candidates in certain indications  in order to focus our resources on more promising candidates or indications 
as a result  the amount or ranges of estimable cost and timing to complete our product development programs and each future product development program is not estimable 
depending upon the progress of our clinical and pre clinical programs we expect our research and development expenses in will be approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to is primarily attributable to an increase of million in sales and marketing expenses due to higher expenses associated with the expanded indication of xibrom to include pain during  an increase of million in due to increased administrative costs related to expanding the operations and other general corporate expenses  and the expense associated with the adoption on january  of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment in the amount of million 
the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to is primarily attributable to an increase of million in sales and marketing expenses associated with the commercial launch of our approved products including an increase in sales personnel from to representatives as of december  offset by a decrease of million 
table of contents in general corporate expenses 
the decrease of million in general corporate expenses is the result of a  increase in general corporate expense in principally related to facility and personnel costs  offset by a one time payment during the third quarter of of million which was recorded upon entering an agreement with allergan pursuant to which we reacquired all rights to market and sell vitrase for all uses in the united states and other specified markets 
we anticipate our selling  general and administrative expenses for will be approximately to million  excluding stock compensation expense which we estimate will be approximately to million for stock based compensation 
compensation for stock options granted to non employees has been determined in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  consensus no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods or services  and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  as the fair value of the equity instrument issued and is periodically re measured as the underlying options vest 
stock option compensation for non employees is recorded as the related services are rendered and the value of compensation is periodically re measured as the underlying options vest 
for the year ended december   we granted stock options to employees to purchase million shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share  equal to the fair market value of our common stock at the time of grant 
in previous years  under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  we granted stock options to employees with a grant price less than the fair market value at the date of grant and recorded deferred compensation of approximately  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively  and recorded amortization of  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we also issued restricted stock awards and included in stock compensation expense is  for the year ended december  related to these restricted stock awards 
interest income 
interest income was million in  million in and  in the increase in interest income in was primarily attributable to higher cash balance as a result of our receipt of million in net proceeds from the issuance of senior subordinated convertible notes during and higher rates of return as compared to the increase in interest income in was primarily attributable to higher cash balances as a result of our receipt of million of net proceeds from our january financing and other stock issuances and higher rates of return as compared to interest expense 
interest expense was approximately million in   in and  in interest expense incurred during was primarily attributable to the interest on the outstanding amounts under our credit facility  the amortization of the deferred financing costs associated with the issuance of million in senior subordinated convertible notes and the interest recorded on these outstanding senior subordinated convertible notes 
interest expense incurred during was primarily attributable to the interest accrued on the million liability due and fully paid during the first quarter of to allergan as a result of our reacquisition of all rights to market and sell vitrase in the united states and other specified markets 
interest expense incurred during was also primarily attributable to the interest accrued on the million liability due to allergan  which was entered into during the fourth quarter of we expect our net interest expense in will be approximately to million as a result of interest on our senior subordinated convertible notes and interest on our revolving credit facility which we anticipate using to a greater extent in to facilitate the growth of our business 
income taxes 
we incurred net operating losses in  and and consequently did not pay any federal  state or foreign income taxes 
at december   we had federal and california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which we have fully reserved due to the uncertainty of realization 
our federal tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in  unless utilized 
our california tax loss carryforwards will continue to expire in  unless utilized 
we also have federal and california research tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal research tax credits will begin to expire in  unless utilized 
our california research tax credit carryforwards do not expire and will carryforward indefinitely until utilized 
in addition  we have california manufacturer s investment credit of approximately  that will begin to expire in  unless utilized 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  million of restricted cash  which supports a letter of credit issued as security for interest payments on the outstanding senior subordinated convertible notes and working capital of million 
historically  we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our debt and equity securities 
since march  we have received gross proceeds of approximately million from sales of our common stock and the issuance of promissory notes and convertible debt 
under our revolving credit facility  we may borrow up to the lesser of million or of our unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and net receivables 
as of december   we had million available for borrowing under the credit facility 
all outstanding amounts under the credit facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to the lender s prime rate plus  which is payable on a monthly basis 
the credit facility also contains customary covenants regarding operations of our business and financial covenants relating to ratios of current assets to current liabilities and is collateralized by all of our assets with the exception of our intellectual property 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the credit facility 
all amounts owing under the credit facility will become due and payable on march  in april  we entered into a credit arrangement whereby we may borrow up to million to finance the purchase of certain capital equipment 
the outstanding amounts under this arrangement will become due and payable ratably over three years from the purchase date of the equipment 
as of december   million was outstanding under this arrangement 
additionally  in june  we issued an aggregate of million in principal amount of our senior subordinated convertible notes  bearing interest per annum payable quarterly in cash in arrears which began october  the notes mature in june and are convertible  at any time following their issuance  into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  subject to certain adjustments 
during  we used million of cash for operations primarily as a result of the net loss of million offset by non cash compensation expense of million  amortization of deferred financing costs related to the senior subordinated convertible notes of million and depreciation expense of million 
during  we used million of cash for operations primarily as a result of the net loss of million and a change in working capital of million  which primarily includes a million payment including interest incurred as a result our reacquisition of all rights to market and sell vitrase in the united states and other specified markets from allergan  and a combined increase in accounts receivable  net  and inventory  net  of million 
during  we used million of cash for operations principally as a result of the net loss of million partially offset by non cash compensation expense of  the transfer of equipment for technology of  and the change in other liabilities of million  relative to the million liability incurred in connection with our reacquisition of all rights to market and sell vitrase for all uses in the united states and other specified markets million was paid prior to december  net cash provided by investing activities totaled million during compared to million of cash used in investing activities during during  million of cash was provided by investing activities 
cash provided by investing activities for is primarily attributable to the issuance of senior subordinated convertible notes in the amount of million  which was subsequently invested in short term investments  offset by allocation of million to support the letter of credit issued as security for interest payments on the outstanding senior subordinated convertible notes 
cash used in investing activities for is primarily attributable to the purchase of our short term investment securities  net of maturities 
cash provided for investing activities in is primarily attributable to the sale of an aggregate of  shares of common stock in two registered direct offerings in august at an aggregate purchase price of million before offering expenses and fees  which was subsequently invested in short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million during compared to million in and million in the net cash provided by financing activities in is primarily the result of proceeds from the line of credit totaling million and repayment on the line of credit totaling million and the issuance of senior subordinated convertible notes in the principal amounts of million  offset by million in financing costs associated with the senior subordinated convertible notes 
the net cash provided by financing activities in is primarily the result of the sale of an aggregate of  shares of common stock under our universal shelf registration statement in an underwritten public offering for an aggregate purchase price of million  before offering expenses and underwriting discounts 
the net cash provided by financing activities in is primarily attributable to million net cash from the sale of an aggregate of  shares of common stock in two registered direct offerings in august at an aggregate purchase price of million 

table of contents we believe that our existing cash balances  together with amounts available for borrowing under our credit facility  will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months 
however  our actual future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the success of the commercialization of our products  sales and marketing activities  and expansion of our commercial infrastructure  related to our approved products and product candidates  the results of our clinical trials and requirements to conduct additional clinical trials  the rate of progress of our research and development programs  the time and expense necessary to obtain regulatory approvals  activities and payments in connection with potential acquisitions of companies  products or technology  competitive  technological  market and other developments  and our ability to establish and maintain collaborative relationships 
these factors may cause us to seek to raise additional funds through additional sales of our debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that funds from these sources will be available when needed or  if available  will be on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution or such equity securities may provide for rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
we have never been profitable  and we might never become profitable 
in this regard  we anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to increase from historical levels as we continue to expand our commercial infrastructure in connection with our commercialization of our approved products 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million  including a net loss of approximately million for the twelve months ended december  and a stockholders deficit of million 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations obligation under capital leases line of credit obligation under equipment debt long term liability obligations total represents million in principal amount of our senior subordinated convertible notes  bearing interest per annum payable quarterly in cash in arrears which began october  the notes mature in june and are convertible  at any time following their issuance  into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  subject to anti dilution adjustments 
in april  we entered into a credit arrangement under which the company may borrow up to million to finance the purchase of capital equipment 
the outstanding amounts under this arrangement will become due and payable ratably over three years from the date of each loan schedule 
in addition to the above  we are committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of our in licensing and development programs 
milestone payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain development  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   the maximum potential future milestone payments to third parties is million 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
included within these policies are our critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management s most subjective and complex judgment due to the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
changes in estimates and assumptions based upon actual results may have a material impact on our results of operations and or financial condition 
we believe that the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are as described below 
revenue recognition product revenue 
we recognize revenue from product sales  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
revenue recognition when right of return exists  when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  when title has passed  the price is fixed or determinable  and we are reasonably assured of collecting the resulting receivable 
we recognize product revenue net of estimated allowances for discounts  returns  rebates and chargebacks 
if actual future payments for allowances for discounts  returns  rebates and chargebacks exceed the estimates we made at the time of sale  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would be negatively impacted 
in general  we are obligated to accept from our customers the return of pharmaceuticals that have reached their expiration date 
we authorize returns for damaged products and exchanges for expired 
table of contents products in accordance with our return goods policy and procedures  and have established reserves for such amounts at the time of sale 
with the launch of each of our products  we recorded a sales return allowance  which was larger for stocking orders than subsequent re orders 
to date  actual product returns have not exceeded our estimated allowances for returns 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable as of the date when made  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
our financial position  results of operations and cash flows may be materially and negatively impacted if actual returns exceed our estimated allowances for returns 

table of contents we establish allowances for estimated rebates  chargebacks and product returns based on numerous qualitative and quantitative factors  including the number of and specific contractual terms of agreements with customers  estimated level of units in the distribution channel  historical rebates  chargebacks and returns of products  direct communication with customers  anticipated introduction of competitive products or generics  anticipated pricing strategy changes by ista s and or its competitors  analysis of prescription data gathered by a third party prescription data provider  the impact of changes in state and federal regulations  and estimated remaining shelf life of products 
in our analyses  we utilize on hand unit data purchased from the major wholesalers  as well as  prescription data purchased from a third party data provider to develop estimates of historical unit channel pull through 
we utilize an internal analysis to compare historical net product shipments to estimated historical prescriptions written 
based on that analysis  we develop an estimate of the quantity of product in the channel which may be subject to various rebate  chargeback and product return exposures 
consistent with industry practice  we periodically offer promotional discounts to our existing customer base 
these discounts are calculated as a percentage of the current published list price and the net price ie  the current published list price less the applicable discount is invoiced to the customer 
accordingly  the discounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period that the program is offered 
in addition to promotional discounts  at the time that we implement a price increase  we generally offer our existing customer base an opportunity to purchase a limited quantity of product at the previous list price 
shipments resulting from these programs generally are not in excess of ordinary levels  therefore  we recognize the related revenue upon receipt by the customer and include the sale in estimating our various product related allowances 
in the event we determine that these sales represent purchases of inventory in excess of ordinary levels for a given wholesaler  the potential impact on product returns exposure would be specifically evaluated and reflected as a reduction in revenue at the time of such sale 
allowances for estimated rebates and chargebacks were million   and  as of december   and  respectively 
these allowances reflect an estimate of our liability for items such as rebates due to various governmental organizations under the medicare medicaid regulations  rebates due to managed care organizations under specific contracts and chargebacks due to various organizations purchasing certain of our products through federal contracts and or group purchasing agreements 
we estimate our liability for rebates and chargebacks at each reporting period based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative assumptions listed above 
allowances for product returns were million  million  and million as of december   and  respectively 
these allowances reflect an estimate of our liability for product that may be returned by the original purchaser in accordance with our stated return policy  which allows customers to return product within six months of it expiry dating and for a period up to months after it has reached the expiration date 
we estimate our liability for product returns at each reporting period based on the estimated units in the channel and the other factors discussed above 
for the years ended december   and  our absolute exposure for rebates  chargebacks and product returns has grown primarily as a result of increased sales of our existing products and the approval of new products 
accordingly  reductions to revenue and corresponding increases to allowance accounts have likewise increased 
the exposure to these revenue reducing items as a percentage of gross product revenue in  and was  and for the allowance for rebates  chargebacks and discounts and was  and for the allowance for product returns  respectively 
the reason for the high product return allowance as a percentage of gross product revenue during was due to the fact that we had only one product on the market that was launched that year 
we typically apply a higher allowance for product returns on stocking orders in connection with an initial launch 
license revenue 
we recognize revenue consistent with the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines in the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and customer acceptance 
amounts received for product and technology license fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period of such services or performance if such arrangements require on going services or performance in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf 
issue no 

table of contents revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
amounts received for milestones are recognized upon achievement of the milestone  unless we have ongoing performance obligations 
royalty revenue is recognized upon sale of the related products  provided the royalty amounts are fixed and determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria will be recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets 
inventories inventory relates to xibrom  a topical non steroidal anti inflammatory formulation of bromfenac for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery  istalol  for the treatment of glaucoma  vitrase usp units ml for use as a spreading agent to facilitate the absorption and dispersion of other injected drugs  and vitrase  lyophilized  usp units multi purpose vial 
inventories  net of allowances  are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first to expire method 
inventories are reviewed periodically for slow moving or obsolete status 
we adjust our inventory to reflect situations in which the cost of inventory is not expected to be recovered 
we would record a reserve to adjust inventory to its net realizable value if a launch of a new product is delayed  inventory may not be fully utilized and could be subject to impairment  when a product is close to expiration and not expected to be sold  when a product has reached its expiration date or when a product is not expected to be saleable 
in determining the reserves for these products  we consider factors such as the amount of inventory on hand and its remaining shelf life  and current and expected market conditions  including management forecasts and levels of competition 
we have evaluated the current level of inventory considering historical trends and other factors  and based on our evaluation  have recorded adjustments to reflect inventory at its net realizable value 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly from actual results if future economic conditions  customer demand  competition or other relevant factors differ from expectations 
these estimates require us to make assessments about the future demand for our products in order to categorize the status of such inventory items as slow moving  obsolete or in excess of need 
these future estimates are subject to the ongoing accuracy of our forecasts of market conditions  industry trends  competition and other factors 
if we over or under estimate the amount of inventory that will not be sold prior to expiration  there may be a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which addresses the accounting for stock based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and instead generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
we use the black scholes merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock based awards under sfas no 
r 
we have elected to use the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas no 
r and  accordingly  prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of sfas no 
r 
the modified prospective transition method requires that stock based compensation expense be recorded for all new and unvested stock options  restricted stock and employee stock purchase plan espp shares that are ultimately expected to vest as the requisite service is rendered 
stock based compensation expense for awards granted prior to january  is based on the grant date fair value measured under sfas no 
we recorded incremental stock based compensation expense of million for the year ended december   as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r 
the black sholes merton option pricing model has various inputs such as the risk free interest rate  volatility  expected life and dividend yield  all of which are estimates 
the change of any of these inputs could significantly impact the determination of the fair value of our options and thus could significantly impact our results of operations 

table of contents income taxes we record a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
new accounting pronouncements the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements  in september the new standard provides guidance on the use of fair value in such measurements 
it also prescribes expanded disclosures about fair value measurements contained in the financial statements 
we are in the process of evaluating the new standard which is not expected to have any effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations although financial statement disclosures will be revised to conform to the new guidance 
the pronouncement  including the new disclosures  is effective for us as of the first quarter of in july  the fasb issued fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
it prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will be required to adopt this interpretation in the first quarter of fiscal year we are currently evaluating the requirements of fin and have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  an amendment of fasb statements no 
and amongst other things  sfas no 
permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments beginning after september  we are currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of sfas no 
 but believe it will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  or sfas no 
sfas no 
expands opportunities to use fair value measurement in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we have not decided if we will early adopt sfas no 
or if we will choose to measure any eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
seeking to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities 
the average duration of all of our investments in was less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair market value of our interest sensitive financial investments 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our investment income  while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest expense 
historically  and as of december   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
all outstanding amounts under our revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to the lender s prime rate plus  which is payable on a monthly basis and which may expose us to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our credit facility 
we estimate that a change in interest rates on our credit facility would not have had a material effect on our net loss for the year ended december  
table of contents we have operated primarily in the united states 
accordingly  we have not had any significant exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
