item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in or implied by any of the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including but not limited to those listed in risk factors and elsewhere in this form k and those listed in other documents we have filed with the securities and exchange commission 
critical accounting policies a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported consolidated amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods reported 
judgments and assessments of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in the areas of allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory obsolescence reserve  stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our judgments and estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
trade receivables are reported in the consolidated balance sheets net of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
generally  we consider receivables past due days subsequent to the billing date 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally extend credit without requiring collateral 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts  which is determined based on historical collection experience or changes in the financial condition of our customers 
as these factors change  our allowance for doubtful accounts may change in subsequent accounting periods 
generally  losses have historically been within management s expectations and have not been significant 
as of june  and june   we maintained an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately  and  or and of gross accounts receivable  respectively 
we determine the inventory obsolescence reserve based on management s historical experience and establish reserves against inventory according to the age of the product 
additional reserves are sometimes established as a result of lack of marketability or changes in customer consumption patterns 
management s judgment is necessary in determining the realizable value of those products to arrive at the proper obsolescence reserve 
total inventory obsolescence reserve as of june  and june  were  and  respectively  or and of total inventory 
we account for corporate income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires an asset and liability approach 
this approach results in the recognition of deferred tax assets future tax benefits and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary timing differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
future tax benefits are subject to a valuation allowance to the extent of the likelihood that the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
the company had a net operating loss carry forward for us federal and state income tax purposes of approximately  as of june  recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued fasb interpretation no

fin 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of fin and the amounts recognized after the adoption should be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
management is currently studying the impact on its financial position upon the adoption of this pronouncement starting the first quarter of the company s fiscal year in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities and to provide additional information that will help investors and other financial statement users to more easily understand the effect of the company s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
finally  sfas requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year beginning after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year provided that the entity makes that choice in the first days of that fiscal year and also elects to apply the provisions of sfas see below 
the company is currently assessing the impact of sfas which it will be required to adopt at the start of fiscal year in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
this standard establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the company has not yet assessed the impact of adopting sfas in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas 
this standard requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded sta us of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur as a component of comprehensive income 
the standard also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position 
the requirement to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan is effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending after december  the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position is effective for the fiscal years ending after december  currently  the company does not have a defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement plans  therefore the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab eliminates the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
it establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of the company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
sab must be applied to annual financial statements for their first fiscal year ending after november  the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
results of operations fiscal year ended june  weeks compared to fiscal year ended june  weeks net sales by geographic region june  june  change usa sales europe sales rest of world sales net sales june  june  change existing products new products net sales by channel june  june  change on board services food service retail military national restaurant chain net sales net sales of  for fiscal year increased  or over prior fiscal year sales of  after considering the additional week in  a week year  sales were still up compared to the prior fiscal year we do not have any defined segments since all of our products are produced similarly despite the sales channel or area of distribution 
our new product sales rose dramatically to  in fiscal year from prior fiscal year new product sales of  a increase 
these new product sales are defined as sales over the first year of introduction 
for fiscal year we had gains in all sales channels with retail now the largest channel with a increase over prior fiscal year  a gain of approximately million 
while we consider new products and channel information helpful to the reader we cannot forecast any particular trends for our sales as a result of such information 
our sales cycle can run over one year in certain markets before recognizing a sale 
gross margin the gross margin decreased this fiscal year to compared the prior fiscal year of 
this margin reduction can be attributed to higher raw materials costs  increases in raw materials due solely to a weak us dollar  fuel surcharges  continued increases in facility expansion and increased costs associated with new product introductions 
while we strive to attain a gross margin target  our sales growth and new product introductions are below target margins 
we anticipate our margins will remain constant with current levels for the foreseeable future 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased in fiscal year to  from prior fiscal year of  a increase 
these expenses represented and  respectively  of the amount of new products sold in the past year 
much of research and development occurs well before an actual sale and the cycle can last over one year in certain markets 
the increase is primarily related to increased salaries from additional staff 
selling and marketing expenses our sales and marketing teams are focused on customers primarily in the usa and europe 
expenses for fiscal year increased  to  or over prior fiscal year expense of  selling and marketing expenses represented and of revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
this increase was primarily related to increased costs associated with in store demonstrations of  increased fees to brokers on higher sales of  and increased salary expense of  general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased  to  or  over prior fiscal year expenses of  general and administrative expenses represented and of revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
most of this increase was related to increased salaries for additional staff of  offset partially by decreased stock option expenses of  and lower consulting fees of  non operating income and expense non operating expense increased to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year  due primarily to the increase in interest expense to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year  relating to the increased outstanding borrowings in the us and france 
income before income taxes income before income taxes in fiscal year of  decreased slightly from fiscal year of  or a decrease of  this decrease is primarily related to lower margins percentage principally from higher raw material costs resulting in approximately a  decrease in potential margins offset by lower increases in selling and marketing and general administrative expenses relevant to revenue and decreased by higher research and development as well as higher interest expenses 
income taxes the effective income tax rate was and in fiscal years and  respectively 
in fiscal year  as a result of positive earnings in recent years  the effective income tax rate differed from the applicable mixed statutory rate of approximately primarily due to the company s current year release of valuation allowances of  resulting in a reduction in effective tax 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this statement addresses uncertainty in tax positions recognized in a company s financial statements and stipulates a recognition threshold and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
management is currently studying the impact on its financial position upon the adoption of this pronouncement starting in the first quarter of the company s fiscal year discontinued operations the company completed the closedown of the norway facility and received official notice in june the favorable  amount represents the final resolution of the estimated expenses related to the closedown effort 
net income net income increased  to  for fiscal year from  in fiscal year the primary reason for the increase was a reversal of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax of  offset by increased deferred taxes of  for a net benefit of  decreased gross margins of in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year were offset by slower increases of selling and marketing expense and general and administrative expense as a percent of sales 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  net sales net sales by region for fiscal year and are as follows june  june  change us france net sales fiscal year revenue of  reflects a consolidated sales increase of from fiscal year revenue of  the increase in sales in fiscal year was attributable to a increase in us sales and a increase in sales from france compared to fiscal year the increases in sales is primarily due to the sales volume increase of and in fiscal year and  respectively  while unit sales prices remained the same in fiscal year versus an increase of in fiscal year is primarily due to the change in product mix 
in fiscal year  four out of five sales channels in the us and two of the four sales channels in france experienced a growth in revenue 
the company s premium food is sold to airlines  passenger rail lines and harbor cruise lines restaurants  hotel and convention center restaurants and banquets  casinos  retail supermarkets  the us military and restaurant chains 
in fiscal year  us sales accounted for of total revenue compared to of total revenue in fiscal year  while france accounted for of total revenue in fiscal year and in fiscal  after eliminating inter company sales 
net sales by sales channel for fiscal year and are as follows june  june  change on board services foodservice retail military national restaurant chains total the company s net sales increased by to  in fiscal year as compared to  in fiscal due to the improved economy and the successful implementation of new cuisine solutions sales strategies resulting in higher demand and sales of the products 
collectively  in the us and france  company sales grew in all five sales channels and it had at least double digit growth in four of the five channels 
although retail sales of cuisine solutions branded items grew substantially in the us in fiscal  retail sales grew cautiously in france with its private label items after management chose to discontinue certain low margin products in fiscal during fiscal year  retail  military and national restaurant chains sales increased substantially by   and  respectively  while foodservices and on board services sales increased by and  respectively 
cuisine solutions fiscal year and sales in the us by sales channel are as follows year ended june  june  change on board services foodservice retail military national restaurant chains total in the us  net sales grew by in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this is primarily due to increased product demand in all sales channels except on board services 
military sales achieved both the highest increase in sales of  and growth rate of due to continual increase in sales to the us military s field feeding programs providing meals to the troops overseas 
also  retail had a strong growth of compared to fiscal primarily resulting from increased cuisine solutions branded package products sold to warehouse and supermarket retailers 
a better diversified sales focus on each of the channels and the improvement in the us economy was very important to the growth in the us sales 
national restaurant chains sales grew as the company gained more products placements in more restaurants during fiscal on board services sales in the us continued to slump as many of the carriers continued having financial difficulties and were eliminating meals to many destinations or were trying alternative menus in first and business class to cut costs 
cuisine solutions fiscal year and sales in france by sales channel are as follows june  june  change on board services foodservice retail new business total net sales grew by in france in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due primarily to the increase in sales in the on board services channel and the stability of the retail channel 
the on board services channel sales grew in fiscal to  compared to the  in fiscal year as airlines in europe continued their recovery 
the foodservice channel sales decreased by  to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year due to a decline in demand resulting from political demonstrations and strikes in france that affected the hospitality industry during early february to early april as well as reduced poultry consumption due to initial scares of an avian flu outbreak in europe during the third quarter of fiscal the retail sales increased  to  in fiscal year  compared to the  in fiscal year  largely due to cautious growth after management s decision to phase out certain low margin private label items in fiscal gross margin a comparison of net sales  gross margin and gross margin percentages for fiscal year and are as follows year ended june  june  net sales gross margin gross margin percentage gross margin increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  due primarily to significantly higher sales  and to a lesser extent increased production efficiencies  and better control over procurement costs 
gross margin as a percent of sales increased to for fiscal compared to in fiscal cuisine solutions has developed new sales channels in the us over the past few years to include military and retail accounts and meals for passenger rail lines  and has seen relatively consistent results in its french subsidiary 
we expect gross margins as a percentage of sales to continue to increase as sales continue to grow and we benefit from economies of scale although operating costs are expected to increase in fiscal year due to increased facility space and equipment in both the us and france 
during fiscal year  the management re evaluated the presentation of its french financial statements and determined that certain manufacturing and depreciation costs should be reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
as a result  in fiscal year  cost of goods sold  other operating income and other income increased by   and  respectively  while selling and administrative expenses and interest expenses decreased by  and  there was no impact to the company s results of operations for either year as a result of these reclassifications 
selling and administrative expenses a comparison of selling and administrative expenses by region are as follows june  june  change us france total selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased  or in fiscal to  compared to  in fiscal these expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in selling and general administrative expenses as a percentage of sales from fiscal versus fiscal is a result of continued cost reduction  efficient use of existing resources and the significant increase in sales described above 
payroll and related expenses  marketing and sales promotion  and travel expenses increased by   and  respectively  in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  as a result of the increased sales activities 
also included in the selling and administrative expenses in fiscal year is a  non cash compensation charge as the result of implementing the new accounting standard sfas no 
r  share based payment 
depreciation and amortization the fiscal year depreciation and amortization expense increased by  over fiscal year to  as a result of an increased amount of machinery and equipment deployed in fiscal to meet the production requirement from the sales increase 
the portions of depreciation and amortization expense that are included in the cost of goods sold are  and  in fiscal year and  respectively 
non operating income and expense non operating expense decreased to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year  due primarily to the decrease in interest expense  to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year  relating to the outstanding borrowings in the us and france  offset by the loss of  in selling the long term investment in fiscal year and the decreases of investment interest income to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year foreign exchange gains of  and  are included in non operating expense for and income from continuing operations a comparison of income from continuing operations for fiscal year and are as follows year ended june  june  income from continuing operations the company reported income from continuing operations of  in fiscal year  or a increase  compared to the income from continuing operations of  in fiscal year the increase in income from continuing operations was primarily driven by a increase in sales and lower cost of goods sold due to manpower and production efficiencies and lower raw material cost 
discontinued operations the company s board of directors approved a plan to discontinue its manufacturing operations in norway on october  as the company had incurred consecutive losses from its operations in norway since inception 
the company liquidated the investments and satisfied the outstanding debt obligation during fiscal year with no impact to the net income 
the discontinued operations in norway had reported a  loss for the fiscal year net income a comparison of net income for fiscal year and are as follows june  june  net income the company reported net income of  for fiscal year  or a increase  compared to the net income of  for fiscal year the increase in income was primarily driven by a increase in sales and lower cost of goods sold due to manpower and production efficiencies and lower raw material cost 
net income loss by region are as follows june  june  us france norway discontinued operations total net income cuisine solutions increased its net income in the us fiscal year by  or  from net income of  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year this increase in net income in the us is due primarily to a increase in sales  strong growth in the military and retail channels  and a increase in gross margin 
cuisine solutions france had its seventh consecutive profitable year since the acquisition by cuisine solutions in net income increased  or  to  in fiscal year profits in france in fiscal year were  in spite of the lackluster economy during the last four years in europe  the french subsidiary reported profitable results and double digit growth in the on board service channel in france 
however  in fiscal  the growth in the on board service channel was offset by the decline in demand in the foodservice channel due to political demonstrations and strikes in france that affected the hospitality industry during early february to early april as well as reduced poultry consumption due to initial scares of an avian flu outbreak in europe during the third quarter of fiscal impact of inflation and the economy inflation in labor and ingredient costs can significantly affect the company s operations 
in fiscal  many of the company s employees were paid hourly rates related to  but generally higher than the federal minimum rates 
the company s sales pricing structure allows for the fluctuation of raw material prices and fuel costs 
as a result  market price variations do not significantly affect the gross margin realized on product sales 
however  most customers require a sixty day notice for price changes in order to update their internal systems and evaluate the impact of price changes 
therefore  in the event of a continuous commodity price increase  the company must either absorb the price increase during that sixty day period or discontinue sales to the customer  and risk losing the long term business relationship 
liquidity and capital resources selected financial ratios at the end of fiscal years and are as follows june  june  liquidity ratios current ratio receivables turnover days sales in receivables inventory turnover days sales in inventory leverage ratio long term debt to equity operating ratios return on investment return on assets cash  cash equivalents  and short term marketable securities were  at the end of fiscal year compared to  at the end of fiscal year during fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was  compared to  in fiscal the decrease in cash by operating activities was primarily due to changes in working capital items increases in inventory of  were only slightly offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year the increase was due primarily to expansion activities at the usa facility  including increased capacity as well as additional production related expenses in france 
projected capital expenditures for fiscal year are estimated to be between  and  cash provided by financing activities was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the company increased its borrowing capacity see below and secured a  equipment loan 
on june   the company entered into two separate lines of credit with branch banking and trust company bb t with a total maximum borrowing amount of million 
both lines of credit bear an annual interest rate of libor plus 
the first line of credit  with a maximum borrowing amount of million and a maturity date of june   is secured by our accounts receivables and inventory  while the second line of credit  with a maximum borrowing amount of million and a maturity of june   is guaranteed by food investors corporation fic  an affiliate of us  and secured by real estate owned by fic 
these two lines of credit replace our million line of credit with the bank of charles town  which was scheduled to mature on november  and has been terminated

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed are interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
interest rate exposure our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our debt portfolio 
a portion of the debt portfolio has fluctuating interest rates that change with changes in the market 
foreign currency exchange rate exposure sales generated in foreign countries were of fiscal year sales 
the majority of our sales are denominated in us dollars  thereby limiting our risk to changes in foreign currency rates 
the functional currency in france is the euro 
fluctuation in the us dollar euro exchange rate impacts the translation of the income statements of our french operations into us dollars and affects year over year comparability of our operating results 
the assets of our foreign subsidiary constituted approximately of the our consolidated total assets and fluctuations in the us dollar euro exchange rate similarly impact the translation of the value of these assets into us dollars 
we do not enter into hedging transactions to mitigate exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as we currently do not believe that this is justified by the potential exposure of the costs associated with derivative securities 
information about our foreign currency translation policy is set forth in note to the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in this form k
