overview the following is a summary of the results of operations for the company in thousands year ended december  revenues expenses income from continuing operations  before income tax provision benefit for income taxes gain loss on disposition of discontinued operations  net of tax net income the company is an insurance holding company engaged in the insurance and reinsurance business through its wholly owned insurance company  independence american insurance company independence american and its managing general underwriter subsidiaries the mgus that currently specialize in medical stop loss insurance 
since november  amic has been affiliated with independence holding company ihc  which currently owns of amic s stock  and ihc s senior management has provided direction to the company through service agreements between the company and ihc 
independence american s primary source of revenue is reinsurance premiums 
the majority of these premiums are ceded to independence american from ihc under long term reinsurance treaties to cede its gross medical stop loss premiums written to independence american 
in addition  independence american assumes full y insured health and short term statutory disability benefit product in new york state dbl premiums from ihc  and assumes medical stop loss premiums from unaffiliated carriers 
independence american began writing medical stop loss business in and will expand this line of business and begin writing two fully insured health products in while management considers a wide range of factors in its strategic planning  the overriding consideration is underwriting profitability 
management s assessment of trends in healthcare and in the medical stop loss market play a significant role in determining whether to expand independence american s reinsurance participation percentage or the number of programs it reinsures 
since independence american reinsures a portion of all of the business produced by the mgus  and since the mgus are also eligible to earn profit sharing commissions based on the profitability of the business they write  the mgus also emphasize underwriting profitability 
in addition  management focuses on controlling operating costs 
by sharing employees with ihc and sharing resources among the mgus and independence american  amic strives to maximize its earnings 
the following is a summary of key performance information and events independence american insurance company was negatively impacted by higher than expected claims from certain of independence american s medical stop loss programs 
the company recorded an overall net loss ratio for medical stop loss of  and in  and  respectively 
the net loss ratio net loss ratio is defined as insurance benefits  claims and reserves  divided by premiums earned less underwriting expenses 
based on currently available information  business incepting in  of which a material portion will be earned and recorded in  is projected to achieve a net loss ratio that is meaningfully lower than that of business incepting in  just as the net loss ratio on business incepting in was meaningfully lower than that of business incepting in premiums increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended added six additional licenses in  bringing total to states and the district of columbia 
average percentage of gross medical stop loss premiums written ceded from ihc to independence american increased to during from during of the company s investment assets  approximately was invested in investment grade fixed income securities  resale agreements  and cash and cash equivalents at december  also at such date  of the company s fixed maturities had the highest naic rating designation naic ratings of and designation 
in  independence american began writing medical stop loss business and will  in  write small group major medical business pursuant to an agreement entered into in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
agreed with a national  career agent marketing organization to begin marketing  in  health plans to individuals and families utilizing independence american as the carrier 
mgu division independencecare  marlton  ras in  the mgus wrote an aggregate of million of annualized gross premium which generated pre tax income of million  as compared to million and million in  respectively 
the mgus wrote less premiums due  in part  to stricter underwriting guidelines and the continuing generally soft market 
in  the mgus generated revenues of million  as compared to million in  a decrease of  due to lower volume of premium underwritten and lower profit commissions 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies and practices is provided in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item management has identified the accounting policies described below as those that  due to the judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements and this management s discussion and analysis insurance reserves the company maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  including legal and other fees  for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
these loss reserves are based on actuarial assumptions and are maintained at levels that are estimated in accordance with gaap 
the company s estimate of loss reserves represents management s best estimate of the company s liability at the balance sheet date 
all of the company s policies are short duration and are accounted for based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims or open claims from prior periods  including losses incurred for claims that have not been reported ibnr 
short duration contract loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events 
management believes that the company s methods of estimating the liabilities for insurance reserves provided appropriate levels of reserves at december  changes in the company s reserve estimates are recorded through a charge or credit to its earnings 
medical stop loss the company s medical stop loss business is comprised of employer stop loss  hmo reinsurance and provider excess 
all of the company s medical stop loss policies are short duration and are accounted for based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims or open claims from prior periods  including losses incurred for claims that have not been reported ibnr 
short duration contract loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events 
the two primary or key assumptions underlying the calculation of loss reserves for medical stop loss business are i projected net loss ratio  and ii claim development patterns 
the projected net loss ratio is set at expected levels consistent with the underlying pricing assumptions projected net loss ratio 
claim development patterns are set quarterly as reserve estimates are developed and are based on recent claim development history claim development patterns 
the company uses the projected net loss ratio to establish reserves until developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate results and it is feasible to set reserves based on claim development patterns 
the company has concluded that a reasonably likely change in the projected net loss ratio assumption could have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  o r liquidity material effect but a reasonably likely change in the claim development pattern would not have a material effect 
projected net loss ratio generally  during the first twelve months of an underwriting year  reserves for medical stop loss are first set at the projected net loss ratio  which is set using pricing assumptions developed using completed prior experience trended forward 
the projected net loss ratio is the company s best estimate of future performance until such time as developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate results 
while the company establishes a best estimate of the projected net loss ratio  actual experience may deviate from this estimate 
while the company believes that larger variations are possible as was the case with the and underwriting years which deviated by and net loss ratio points  respectively  based on a review of historical net loss ratios experienced by the company  the reasonably likely deviation from the expected net loss ratio is between three and five net loss ratio points 
therefore  based on its experience to date  it is reasonably likely that the actual experience will fall within a range up to five loss ratio points above or below the expected pricing loss ratio 
the impact of these reasonably likely changes at december   would be an increase in net reserves in the case of a higher ratio or a decrease in net reserves in the case of a lower ratio of up to approximatel y million with a corresponding increase or decrease in the pre tax expense for insurance benefits  claims and reserves in the consolidated statement of operations 
major factors that affect the projected net loss ratio assumption in reserving for medical stop loss relate to i frequency and severity of claims  ii changes in medical trend resulting from the influences of underlying cost inflation  changes in utilization and demand for medical services  the impact of new medical technology and changes in medical treatment protocols  and iii the adherence by the mgus that produce and administer this business to the company s underwriting guidelines 
changes in these underlying factors are what determine the reasonably likely changes in the projected net loss ratio as discussed above 
claim development patterns subsequent to the first twelve months of an underwriting year  the company s developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate losses 
at this point  claims have developed to a level where claim development patterns can be applied to generate reasonably reliable estimates of ultimate claim levels 
development factors based on historical patterns are applied to paid and reported claims to estimate fully developed claims 
claim development patterns are reviewed quarterly as reserve estimates are developed and are based on recent claim development history 
the company must determine whether changes in development represent true indications of emerging experience or are simply due to random claim fluctuations 
the company also establishes its best estimates of claim development factors to be applied to more developed treaty year experience 
while these factors are based on historical claim development patterns  actual claim development may vary from these estimates 
the company does not believe that reasonably likely changes in its actual claim development patterns would have a material effect 
predicting ultimate claims and estimating reserves in medical stop loss is more complex than first dollar medical and disability business due to the excess of loss nature of these products with very high deductibles applying to specific claims on any individual claimant and in the aggregate for a given group 
the level of these deductibles makes it more difficult to predict the amount and payment pattern of such claims 
fluctuations in results for specific coverage are primarily due to the severity and frequency of individual claims  whereas fluctuations in aggregate coverage are largely attributable to frequency of underlying claims rather than severity 
liabilities for first dollar medical reserves and disability coverages are computed using completion factors and expected loss ratios derived from actual historical premium and claim data 
due to the short term nature of medical stop loss  redundancies or deficiencies will typically emerge during the course of the following year rather than over a number of years 
for employer stop loss  as noted above  the company maintains its reserves based on underlying pricing assumptions until it determines that an adjustment is appropriate based on emerging experience from its mgus for prior underwriting years 
reserves for hmo reinsurance and provider excess are adjusted on a policy by policy basis 
because of the small number of hmo reinsurance and provider excess policies it writes  the company is able to evaluate each policy individually for potential liability by reviewing open claims with each hmo or provider group and applying completion factors using historical data 
fully insured reserves for fully insured medical and dental business are established using historical claim development patterns 
claim development by number of months elapsed from the incurred month is studied each month and development factors are calculated 
these claim development factors are then applied to the amount of claims paid to date for each incurred month to estimate fully complete claims 
the difference between fully complete claims and the claims paid to date is the estimated reserve 
total reserves are the sum of the reserves for all incurred months 
the primary assumption in the determination of fully insured reserves is that historical claim development patterns are representative of future claim development patterns 
factors which may affect this assumption include changes in claim payment processing times and procedures  changes in time delay in submission of claims and the incidence of unusually large claims 
the reserving analysis includes a review of claim processing statistical measures and large claim early notifications  the potential impact of any changes in these factors are minimal 
the time delay in submission of claims tends to be stable over time and not subject to significant volatility 
the company does not believe that any reasonably likely change in these factors will have a material effect 
premium and mgu fee income revenue recognition direct and assumed premiums from short duration contracts are recognized as revenue over the period of the contracts in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided 
the company records mgu fee income as policy premium payments are earned 
mgus are compensated in two ways 
they earn fee income based on the volume of business produced  and collect profit sharing commissions if such business exceeds certain profitability benchmarks 
profit sharing commissions are accounted for beginning in the period in which the company believes they are reasonably estimable  which is typically at the point that claims have developed to a level where claim development patterns can be applied to generate reasonably reliable estimates of ultimate claim levels 
reinsurance independence american is primarily a reinsurer  and currently derives most of its business from pro rata quota share reinsurance treaties with standard security life and madison national life which are wholly owned subsidiaries of ihc 
these treaties were entered into in and terminate on december   unless terminated sooner by independence american 
standard security life and madison national life must cede at least of their medical stop loss business to independence american under these treaties 
additionally  standard security life  madison national life and independence american have received regulatory approval to cede up to to independence american under most of ihc s medical stop loss programs 
for the twelve months ended december  and  standard security life and madison national life ceded an average of and  respectively  of their medical stop loss business to in dependence american 
commencing in july  independence american began reinsuring of standard security life s short term statutory disability benefit product dbl business 
in  standard security life and madison national life began ceding of the majority of its fully insured business to independence american 
ihc provides the company with pro rata quota share reinsurance on business written by independence american 
this business accounted for approximately of the company s total earned premiums at december  commencing in january  independence american began ceding of its provider excess insurance to madison national life 
in january  independence american increased the amount ceded to madison national life to 
this treaty was entered into on january  and will remain in force for an indefinite period  unless terminated by either party as of any december the company is not aware of any regulatory or other restrictions on the ability of ihc to fund its obligations under agreements in which ihc reinsures such provider excess business 
any such restrictions would at this point have a minimal impact on the company 
in addition  in independ ence american ceded of its stm business to unrelated reinsurers 
income taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
management believes that although sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the future realization of deferred tax assets  the valuation allowance has been adjusted to account for the expected utilization of net operating losses against future taxable income 
the company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes available to reduce future income subject to income taxes 
the net operating loss carryforwards expire between and us federal and california tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change for tax purposes  as defined in section of the internal revenue code 
for tax purposes  an ownership change occurred during and  as a result  utilization of the net operating losses arising prior to will be subject to an annual limitation in future years 
investments the company accounts for its investments in debt and equity securities under sfas no

the company also had million and million  on average  in trading accounts at december  and  respectively 
all such trading securities were liquidated at december  and net realized gains and losses on investments are computed using the specific identification method and a re reported in the consolidated statements of operations 
declines in value of securities available for sale that are judged to be other than temporary are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in the consolidated statements of operations as net realized losses 
the factors considered by management in determining when a decline is other than temporary include but are not limited to the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  adverse changes in ratings announced by one or more rating agencies  whether the issuer of a debt security has remained current on principal and interest payments  whether the decline in fair value appears to be issuer specific or  alternatively  a reflection of general market or industry conditions including  in the case of fixed maturities  the effect of changes in market interest rates  and the company s intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in fair value 
for securities within the scope of emerging issues task force issue  such as purchased interest only securities  an impairment loss is recognized when there has been a decrease in expected cash flows combined with a decline in the security s fair value below cost 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  which consist of licenses  are not amortized but are tested for impairment  on a reporting unit basis  at the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year  or more frequently if indicators arise

each month the premium is remitted to the insurance carriers by the mgus 
until such remittance is made the collected premium is carried as an asset on the balance sheet of each mgu with a corresponding payable to each insurance carrier 
in addition to the premium being held at the mgus  the mgus are in possession of cash to pay claims claim funds 
the cash is deposited by each insurance carrier into a bank account that the mgus can access 
the cash is used by the mgus to pay claims on behalf of the insurance carriers they represent 
the availability of cash enables the mgus to reimburse claims in a timely manner 
the company has million of insurance reserves that it expects to pay out of current assets and cash flows from future business 
if necessary  the company could sell its fixed maturity investments if the timing of claim payments associated with our insurance resources does not coincide with future cash flows

of the aggregate carrying value of the company s investment assets  approximately was invested in investment grade fixed income securities  resale agreements  and cash and cash equivalents at december  also at such date  of the company s fixed maturities were investment grade 
these investments carry less default risk and  therefore  lower interest rates than other types of fixed maturity investments 
at december   of the carrying value of fixed maturities was invested in diversified non investment grade fixed income securities 
investments in such securities have different risks than investment grade securities  including greater risk of loss upo n default  and thinner trading markets 
the company does not have any non performing fixed maturities 
the composition of the company s fixed maturities at december   utilizing standard and poor s rating categories  was as follows grade invested aaa aa a bbb bb or lower investment impairments the company reviews its investments regularly and monitors its investments continually for impairments 
for the years ended december  and  the company had no realized losses for other than temporary impairments 
the company s gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities totaled  and  at december  and respectively

the unrealized losses have been evaluated in accordance with the company s policy and were determined to be temporary in nature at december  the company holds all fixed maturities as available for sale and accordingly marks all of its securities to market through accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
balance sheet total investments increased  to  at december  from  at december   due to net income 
the  increase in total stockholders equity is primarily due to net income of  generated during fiscal the company had receivables from reinsurers of  at december  substantially all of the business ceded to such reinsurers is of short duration 
all of such receivables are either due from related parties  highly rated companies or are adequately secured 
no allowance for doubtful accounts was deemed necessary at december  capital resources due to its strong capital ratio and excellent asset quality and credit worthiness  the company remains well positioned to increase or diversify its current activities 
it is anticipated that future acquisitions or other expansion of operations will be funded internally from existing capital and surplus and parent company liquidity 
in the event additional funds are required  it is expected that they would be borrowed or raised in the public or private capital markets to the extent determined to be necessary or desirable 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company may carry its portfolio of fixed income securities either as held to maturity carried at amortized cost  as trading securities carried at fair value or as available for sale carried at fair value 
the company has chosen to carry its debt securities as available for sale 
the company experienced a change in net unrealized loss of  reflecting a net unrealized loss of  at december  from a net unrealized loss of  at december  from time to time  as warranted  the company employs investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures 
the company enters into a variety of contractual obligations with third parties in the ordinary course of its operations 
these obligations  as of december   are set forth in the table below 
however  we do not believe that our cash flow requirements can be fully assessed based upon an analysis of these obligations 
future cash outflows  whether they are contractual obligations or not  also will vary based upon our future needs 
although some outflows are fixed  others depend on future events

independence american is primarily a reinsurer  and currently derives most of its business from pro rata quota share medical stop loss reinsurance treaties the ihc treaties with standard security life and madison national life  which are wholly owned subsidiaries of independence holding company ihc 
ihc owns of the company s common stock 
the ihc treaties were entered into in and terminate on december   unless terminated sooner by independence american 
there are three factors that determine the amount of premiums assumed by independence american i the percentage of business ceded to independence american pursuant to the ihc treaties or otherwise  ii the amount of gross premium produced by the mgu subsidiaries and other distribution sources written by standard security life or madison national life that is ceded to independence american under the ihc treaties  and iii the amount of gross premium produced by the mgu subsidiaries and other distribution sources written by carriers other than standard security life or madison national life that is ceded to independence american 
ihc treaties with respect to the ihc treaties  the company s operating results are affected by the following factors i the percentage of business ceded to independence american pursuant to the ihc treaties  ii the amount of gross premium written by standard security life and madison national life that can be ceded pursuant to the ihc treaties  and iii the profitability of the business ceded 
percentage of business ceded with respect to medical stop loss  ihc has agreed to cede a minimum of of its medical stop loss business to independence american  and ihc has increased this percentage each year since inception of the ihc treaties 
standard security life  madison national life and independence american have received regulatory approval for standard security life and madison national life to cede up to to independence american under most of ihc s medical stop loss programs 
for the twelve months ended december  and december   standard security life and madison national life ceded an average of and  respectively  of their gross medical stop loss premiums written to independence american 
this increase in ceding percentage was offset by a decrease in gross medical stop loss premiums written by ihc including business written by the mgu subsidiaries and otherwise resulting in a small decrease in p remiums earned by independence american 
in and beyond  any increase in the percentage of medical stop loss ceded to independence american will depend on how much ihc determines it has available to reinsure and independence american s desire to increase the percentage 
since the percentage being ceded is now well in excess of the contractual minimum  there is no guaranty that ihc will continue to increase the percentage of business ceded to independence american or  in fact  cede in excess of 
however  the amic mgus are the largest producers of medical stop loss business for ihc  controlling a majority of this premium in commencing in july  independence american began reinsuring of standard security life s short term statutory disability benefit product dbl 
standard security life is not contractually obligated to continue to cede this business to independence american after termination of the current treaty year 
in  standard security life and madison national life began ceding of the majority of its fully insured business to independence american 
standard security life and madison national life are not contractually obligated to continue to cede this business to independence american after termination of the current treaty years 
the company does not expect the percentage ceded to it from ihc will change significantly in the next twelve months upon renewal of each of the programs underlying the ihc treaties  standard security life and madison national life determine the maximum percentage of risk to be offered to independence american and independence american determines the percentage that it wishes to accept 
a typical pro rata quota share reinsurance treaty is for a twelve month period in which the ceding company and the reinsurer share the premiums as well as the losses and expenses in an agreed proportion for all policies written with an effective date within this period 
most treaties run from january to december  but others could begin and end in other periods 
therefore the percentage ceded could change as the year progresses 
if independence american  standard security life  and madison national life had agreed to increase the average percentage ceded to independence american by from the ceded for the twelve months ended december  and standard security life s and madison national life s gross written premium had remained unchanged  independence american s premium would have increased by approximately million  which is approximately of total net premiums earned for the year ended december  that increase in premium  however  would not have flowed directly to pre tax operating income because of corresponding changes in insurance benefits  claims and reserves and other expenses attributable to the increase in premiums 
amount of gross premiums written the gross medical stop loss premiums written by ihc decreased in by and such premiums produced by the amic mgus decreased by in  as a result of writing and or renewing fewer policies due to competitors willingness to write business at profit margins lower than those acceptable to the company  partially offset by increased rates on the policies retained 
this resulted in a decrease in the gross amount of premium available to be ceded to independence american 
the amic mgus do not anticipate materially increasing their production of medical stop loss business in ihc has reported that it expects its gross dbl premiums to be relatively stable in  however  it expects meaningful growth in its stm and cdhp premiums in profitability the medical stop loss market is generally cyclical in nature 
when a product experiences several consecutive years of underwriting profitability  it is not unusual for there to be more competitors entering that line which can increase pressure on pricing and create a softer market 
the medical stop loss market began to soften in and less favorable conditions continued through  and as a result of these market conditions  the rate that the carriers that cede business to the company were able to charge for medical stop loss increased at a lesser rate in recent years  however  increases in medical trend have also been held in check to a greater extent and deductibles and attachment points have increased 
this reduces the risk taker s overall risk exposure 
despite these market conditions  the company produced significantly profitable results in and  marginally profitable resu lts in and  and expects improved profitability in based on currently available information  business incepting in  of which a material portion will be earned and recorded in  is projected to achieve a net loss ratio that is meaningfully lower than that of business incepting in  just as the net loss ratio on business incepting in was meaningfully lower than that of business incepting in fully insured business  including the stm and cdhp lines  tends to be less volatile and less cyclical than excess insurance 
therefore  the impact on the company s operating results relating to the ihc treaties can be summarized as follows i assuming continuing profitability of the underlying business  the company s results would be positively impacted if ihc were to cede a higher percentage and adversely affected if ihc were to cede less  ii independence american s income would be negatively impacted if ihc s gross premium written were to decrease  and iii independence american s income in future years would be positively affected if ihc were to produce higher profit margins  and negatively impacted if loss ratios increase 
marketing agreements in february  independence american entered into an agreement with a marketing organization with a growing block of fully insured health business  including cdhps  primarily sold to small employer groups  and medical stop loss  to begin writing for independence american 
the organization that produces this business began writing employer medical stop loss through independence american in  and will move the majority of its existing block of fully insured and stop loss health insurance currently approximately million to independence american during this block  which is expected to have meaningful growth  has averaged risk profit over the past five years  although there is no guaranty that such results will be maintained 
independence american will be the exclusive issuing carrier for business underwritten by this organization through december  subject to certain conditions  the agre ement will automatically extend until december   and this organization could be entitled to additional cash consideration see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the company has entered into an agreement with a national  career agent marketing organization to begin marketing health plans to individuals and families utilizing independence american as the carrier 
the agency projects that it will have million of annualized premiums million on an earned basis on independence american paper as of december  independence american initially anticipates retaining of the risk on this business 
the program will be administered by insurers administrative corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of ihc 
these amounts are less than what was initially disclosed due to a later than anticipated launch date as a result of product design changes and filing requirements
