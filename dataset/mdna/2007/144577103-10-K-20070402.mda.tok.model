general overview for the year ended december   we achieved record annual drilling success rates  levels of production  natural gas and oil revenues and at the end of our proved oil and gas reserves also reached a record level 
due to our drilling success  we produced a record bcfe in compared to bcfe in at the end of  we also reached a record estimated proved reserves level of bcfe with bcfe of net additions for the year  replacing of our production

between january  and december   of our wells drilled were exploratory and were developmental 
in  of these wells were exploratory and were developmental 
the percentage of developmental wells reflects our increased activity in the barnett shale area  which has a relatively higher concentration of development well targets than the onshore gulf coast area 
in  our natural gas and oil revenues reached a record level at million  and our net income available to common shareholders was million  or and per basic and fully diluted share  respectively 
in  our natural gas and oil revenues were million  and our net income available to common shareholders was million  or and per basic and fully diluted share  respectively 
these increases in natural gas and oil revenues and net income were attributable in part to the record levels of production discussed above 
our financial results are largely dependent on a number of factors  including commodity prices 
commodity prices are outside of our control and historically have been and are expected to remain volatile 
natural gas prices in particular have remained volatile during the last few years 
commodity prices are affected by changes in market demands  overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil prices  and therefore  cannot accurately predict revenues 
carrizo s average natural gas sales price for decreased to per mcf compared to per mcf in  and the average oil sales price for increased to per barrel from per barrel in because natural gas and oil prices are unstable  we periodically enter into price risk management transactions such as swaps  collars  futures and options to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations associated with a portion of our natural gas and oil production and to achieve a more predictable cash flow 
the use of these arrangements limits our ability to benefit from potential increases in the prices of natural gas and oil 
our derivative arrangements may apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial protection against declines in natural gas and oil prices 
we have continued to reinvest a substantial portion of our operating cash flows into funding our drilling program and increasing the amount of d seismic data available to us 
in  we expect capital expenditures  excluding capitalized interest and overhead  to be approximately to million  as compared to million in in  we plan to drill gross wells in the onshore gulf coast area  gross wells in our barnett shale area  to gross wells in our east texas area  primarily in our camp hill oil field  and five wells in other areas 
the actual number of wells drilled will vary depending upon various factors  including the availability and cost of drilling rigs  land and industry partner issues  our cash flow  success of drilling programs  weather delays and other factors 
if we drill the number of wells we have budgeted for  depreciation  depletion and amortization  oil and natural gas operating expenses and production are expected to increase over levels incurred in our ability to drill this number of wells is heavily dependent upon the timely access to oilfield services  particularly drilling rigs 
the shortage of available rigs in delayed the drilling of several wells  slowing our growth in production 
at december   our net debt to total net capitalization ratio computed as total debt net of cash  net debt  divided by the sum of net debt plus total book equity was  an increase from the ratio at the end of this increase was primarily the result of borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility totaling million during  partially offset by million of net proceeds from the private placement of million shares of common stock in july please read liquidity and capital resources financing arrangements for more information on our financing activities 
since our initial public offering  we have grown primarily through the exploration of properties within our project areas  although we consider acquisitions from time to time and may in the future complete acquisitions that we find attractive 
in  and we completed asset acquisitions in our barnett shale project area described below in barnett shale area 
public offering and and private placements of common stock in the first quarter of  we completed the public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share 
the offering included  newly issued shares offered by us and  shares offered by certain selling shareholders 
our net proceeds of approximately million from this offering were used to accelerate our drilling program  to retain larger interests in portions of our drilling prospects that we otherwise would sell down or for which we would seek joint partners  to fund a portion of our activities in the barnett shale area and for general corporate purposes 
we did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by the selling shareholders 
in the second quarter of  we sold million shares of our common stock or approximately of the fully diluted shares outstanding before the offering to institutional investors at a price of per share in a private placement the 
table of contents private placement  a discount to the close price on the nasdaq stock market for our common stock the day prior to pricing 
the net proceeds from the private placement  after the placement agents fees but before offering expenses  were approximately million 
we used the proceeds from the private placement to fund a portion of our capital expenditure program  including our drilling programs in the barnett shale and onshore gulf coast areas 
in july  we sold million shares of our common stock to institutional investors at a price of per share in a private placement the private placement 
the number of shares sold was approximately of our fully diluted shares outstanding before the offering 
the net proceeds  after deducting placement agents fees but before paying offering expenses  of approximately million were principally used to fund a portion of our capital expenditures program 
in connection with the private placement  we entered into subscription and registration rights agreements the subscription and registration rights agreements with the investors in the private placement 
the subscription and registration rights agreements provide registration rights with respect to the shares purchased in the private placement 
we filed a resale shelf registration statement in connection with the private placement that has been declared effective by the sec 
we are generally subject to specified penalties in the event we do not maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement 
we are subject to certain covenants under the terms of the subscription and registration rights agreements  including the requirement that the registration statement be kept effective for resale of shares for two years 
in certain situations  we are required to indemnify the investors in the private placement  including without limitation  for certain liabilities under the securities act 
barnett shale area in mid  we became active in the barnett shale play located in tarrant and parker counties in northeast texas 
our activity accelerated as a result of the acquisition on february  of working interests and acreage in certain oil and gas wells located in the newark east field in denton county  texas in the barnett shale trend for million the barnett shale acquisition 
this acquisition included non operated working interests in properties ranging from to over  gross acres  or an average working interest of 
the acquisition included existing gross wells net and interests in approximately  net acres 
in april  we acquired leases and producing wells in the barnett shale for approximately million which consisted of approximately net acres and working interests in existing gross wells net with an estimated mmcfe of proved reserves  based upon our internal estimates 
all of the interests in the wells acquired related to wells in which we already had an interest 
the consideration paid for this acquisition was million in cash and  shares of our common stock 
initially  we financed our barnett shale activities with our available cash on hand 
we subsequently financed a portion of our capital expenditure program for the barnett shale area with a portion of the funds from the october issuance of the senior subordinated secured notes the private placement  the private placement and the second lien credit facility 
in the barnett shale area  we drilled gross wells net in  gross wells net in and gross wells net in  all of which were successful 
we plan to drill gross wells net in this area in at the end of our net production had risen to approximately mmcfe d with gross wells on line and another gross wells in various stages of testing  completion and awaiting pipeline hookup 
as of march   our estimated net production in this area was mmcfe d 
in addition to our drilling activity  we have continued to expand our barnett shale acreage position  growing our net leasehold acreage from approximately  to  acres  at the end of and  respectively 
similarly  we have increased our estimated number of developmental locations from to horizontal locations  at the end of and  respectively  and we have increased our estimated number of exploratory drilling locations horizontal in the barnett shale area from to locations  at the end of and  respectively 
pinnacle gas resources  inc during the second quarter of  we acquired interests in natural gas and oil leases in wyoming and montana in areas prospective for coalbed methane and subsequently began to drill wells on those leases 
during the second quarter of  we through ccbm  our wholly owned subsidiary contributed our interests in certain of these leases to a newly formed company  pinnacle gas resources  inc pinnacle 
in exchange for this contribution  we received of the common stock of pinnacle and options to purchase additional pinnacle common stock 
in march  credit suisse first boston private equity entities the csfb parties contributed additional funds of million into pinnacle to fund its development program  which increased the csfb parties ownership to on a fully diluted basis assuming we and us energy corp

in november  the csfb parties and a former pinnacle employee received  and  shares of pinnacle common stock  respectively  after exercising certain warrants and options 
accordingly  ccbm s ownership in pinnacle was at december  on a fully diluted basis 
in april  prior to and in connection with a private placement by pinnacle of  shares of its common stock  pinnacle issued new shares of its common stock to each of its stockholders in exchange for each existing share in a stock split  pinnacle redeemed the preferred stock held by the csfb parties at of par value  the csfb parties exercised all of their warrants on a cashless net exercise basis  and ccbm and us energy exercised their respective options on a cashless net exercise basis 
on april   after the stock split  the redemption of the preferred stock  the warrant and option exercises and the private placement  ccbm owned  shares of pinnacle s common stock  and its ownership of pinnacle was on a fully diluted basis 
on such date  us energy and the csfb parties owned  and  shares of pinnacle s common stock  respectively  and their ownership of pinnacle was and on a fully diluted basis  respectively 
on september   us energy sold all of its  shares of pinnacle s common stock to the csfb parties 
as of december   ccbm owned  shares of pinnacle s common stock  and its ownership of pinnacle was on a fully diluted basis 
in addition to our interest in pinnacle  we have maintained interests in approximately  gross acres at the end of in the castle rock coalbed methane project area in montana and the oyster ridge project area in wyoming 
see business and properties pinnacle transaction for a description of this transaction 
our discussion of future drilling and capital expenditures does not reflect operations conducted through pinnacle 
derivative transactions our financial results are largely dependent on a number of factors  including commodity prices 
commodity prices are outside of our control and historically have been and are expected to remain volatile 
natural gas prices in particular have remained volatile during the last few years and more recently oil prices have become volatile 
commodity prices are affected by changes in market demands  overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil prices  and therefore  cannot accurately predict revenues 
because natural gas and oil prices are unstable  we periodically enter into price risk management transactions such as swaps  collars  futures and options to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations associated with a portion of our natural gas and oil production and to achieve a more predictable cash flow 
the use of these arrangements limits our ability to benefit from increases in the prices of natural gas and oil 
our derivative arrangements may apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial protection against declines in natural gas and oil prices 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues for increased to million from million in production volumes for oil and natural gas in increased to bcfe from bcfe in realized average natural gas sales price for decreased to per mcf compared to per mcf in  and the average oil sales price for increased to per barrel from per barrel in the increase in natural gas production was primarily due to the production from the three galloway gas unit wells and new wells in the barnett shale area 
the gas production volume increases were partially offset by production declines from the delta farms and the beach house wells

this was partially offset by a million decrease in severance taxes due to lower average natural gas prices in and a lower effective severance tax rate for our barnett shale wells which qualify for high cost gas tax well credits 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense for increased to million from million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in production volumes and an increase in the dd a rate primarily due to additions to the proved property cost base 
general and administrative g a expense for increased to million from million for the increase in g a was due primarily to i higher incentive compensation and base salary costs of million  ii increased contract labor cost of million to cover certain accounting staff vacancies and to support the continued phase in of our new integrated software system  iii million in higher audit fees primarily related to the company s financial restatement for mark to market accounting derivatives and iv increased bad debt expenses of million primarily due to an outside operator bankruptcy filing 
the net gain on derivatives was million for the year ended december   comprised of a million of unrealized mark to market net gains on derivatives million gain on oil and gas derivatives and million losses on interest rate swaps and a million of net realized gains million gain from oil and gas derivatives  million gain from interest rate swaps and million gain from the sell down of the interest rate swap position as a result of an amendment to the company s second lien credit facility in december 
interest expense and capitalized interest in were million and million  respectively  as compared to million and million in these increases were attributable to the debt refinancing in july and borrowings under the company s senior secured credit facility beginning in may income taxes increased to million in from million in due to the increase in pre tax income

the gas production volume increases were partially offset by production declines from the delta farms and the beach house wells  which were shut in for workovers during the second and third quarters of  the temporary shut in of a number of wells as a result of the katrina and rita hurricanes  and the sale of the shadyside in the first quarter of the decrease in oil production volume was principally due to production declines from the aforementioned workovers  the hurricane related shut ins  and a natural production decline for the hankamer the following table summarizes production volumes  average sales prices and operating revenues for our oil and natural gas

operating expenses per equivalent unit in increased to per mcfe from per mcfe in the per unit cost increased primarily as a result of the higher costs noted above 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense for increased to million from million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in production volumes and an increase in the dd a rate attributable to the increased land  seismic and drilling costs added to the proved property cost base and to future development costs largely related to the significant increase in barnett shale wells 
general and administrative g a expense for increased to million from million for the increase in g a was due primarily to higher salary due to increased headcount and annual raises and incentive compensation costs and in part due to million of expenses related to an integrated software migration project 
stock based compensation in increased by million to million compared to mark to market loss on derivatives  net was million in comprised of million of realized loss on net settled derivatives and million of net unrealized loss on the derivatives accounted for as non designated derivatives 
mark to market gain loss of derivatives  net was million in comprised of million of realized loss on net settled derivates and million of net unrealized gain on the derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges 
we recorded a million after tax charge  or per fully diluted share  on our minority interest in pinnacle for the ended year december  of this charge  million relates to a valuation allowance for federal income taxes and million is for the mark to market loss on derivatives 
it is likely that pinnacle will continue to record a valuation allowance on the deferred federal tax benefit generated from the operating losses incurred during the early development stages of pinnacle s coalbed methane project 
concurrently  we will record valuation allowances relative to our share of pinnacle s financial results 
interest income was million for the year of compared to million in the year of the increase is due to the significant increase in the average cash and cash equivalent balance outstanding in connection with the july debt refinancing and borrowings under the million second lien credit facility 
interest expense and capitalized interest in were million and million  respectively  as compared to interest expense and capitalized interest of million and million in these increases in are attributable to the aforementioned debt refinancing in july income taxes increased to million in from million in due to the increase in pre tax income  including the valuation allowance for the equity in loss of pinnacle gas resources  inc dividends and accretion of discount on preferred stock decreased to zero in from million in as a result of the conversion of all of the series b preferred stock into common stock during the second quarter of 
table of contents net income available to common shareholders for decreased to million from million in primarily as a result of the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources during  our capital expenditures of  net of million in proceeds from property sales  exceeded our net cash flows provided by operating activities 
for future capital expenditures  we expect to use cash on hand  cash generated by operating activities and available draws on the senior credit facility to partially fund our planned drilling expenditures and fund leasehold costs and geological and geophysical costs on our exploration projects in we may need to seek other financing alternatives to fully fund our capital expenditures program  including possible debt or equity financings 
we may not be able to obtain financing needed in the future on terms that would be acceptable to us 
if we cannot obtain adequate financing  we may be required to limit or defer our planned oil and natural gas exploration and development program  thereby adversely affecting the recoverability and ultimate value of our oil and natural gas properties 
our primary sources of liquidity have included funds generated by operations  proceeds from the issuance of various securities  including our common stock  preferred stock and warrants including our public offering in and our private placements in and of our common stock  and borrowings under our credit facilities 
our liquidity position has been enhanced by the availability of funds under the senior credit facility  the borrowing base of which was increased to million  effective november  in addition  we received net proceeds of million from the private placement 
in december  we completed an amendment to the second lien credit facility providing for million of additional borrowings which was drawn on january  the company used a portion of million net proceeds to repay the million of outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility 
accordingly  the amended and undrawn borrowing base availability on our senior credit facility was million see financing arrangements senior secured revolving credit facility for further discussion 
we received million in proceeds from property sales in the sales included properties in both our gulf coast and barnett shale areas 
we may continue to sell properties to fund a portion of our capital expenditures program 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in cash flows provided by operations in as compared to was primarily due to higher oil and gas revenues generated from increased production

estimated maturities of long term debt are million in each of the years through and the remainder in the following table sets forth estimates of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by year in thousands total long term debt operating leases drilling contracts seismic data commitments total contractual cash obligations in addition to the contractual obligations presented above  we are also party to a firm well commitment agreement in the north sea to drill one well within the next four years 
currently we expect to incur between million and million to drill the well between and  unless we alternately choose in the future to sell down our interest to another company 
we have planned capital expenditures excluding capitalized interest in of approximately million to million  of which million is expected to be used for drilling activities in our project areas and the balance is expected to be used to fund d seismic surveys and land acquisitions 
in  we plan to drill approximately gross wells in the onshore gulf coast area and gross wells in our barnett shale area and to gross wells in our east texas areas  primarily in our camp hill oil field 
the actual number of wells drilled and capital expended is dependent upon our available financing  cash 
table of contents flow  availability and cost of drilling rigs  land and partner issues and other factors 
capital expenditures do not include operating costs such as the steam costs that will be required for the multi year development of our camp hill project  as discussed below 
we have continued to reinvest a substantial portion of our cash flows into increasing our d prospect portfolio  improving our d seismic interpretation technology and funding our drilling program 
oil and gas capital expenditures were million  million and million including the barnett shale acquisition for  and  respectively 
our efforts resulted in the apparent drilling successes comprised of gross wells in  including gross wells in the barnett shale area  gross wells in  including gross wells in the barnett shale area  and gross wells in  including gross wells in the barnett shale area 
we have increased the development of our camp hill project 
in august  management proposed the acceleration of the camp hill development to our board of directors 
accordingly  a development plan was formally approved by the board for increased drilling activity in the camp hill field  beginning with an initial well drilling program 
in february  our board of directors formally approved a multi year plan to fully develop the entire camp hill field 
in furtherance of this plan  we expect to drill between and gross wells in this area at an estimated cost of million during to fully develop the field  we expect to drill approximately wells from through  at a total cost of approximately million and total operating costs including steam of approximately million 
the precise timing and amount of our expenditures on additional well drilling and increased steam injection to develop the proved undeveloped reserves in this project will depend on several factors including the relative prices of oil and natural gas

lease option arrangements due to the limited capital available in the first half of to fund all of the company s ongoing lease acquisition efforts in the barnett shale and other shale plays  the company elected to enter into several lease option agreements with a number of third parties and with steven a 
webster  the company s chairman collectively  the counterparties 
the terms and conditions of the leasing arrangement agreement terms are described below with mr 
webster are consistent with the leasing arrangements the company has entered into with the other third parties 
these leasing arrangements provide the company the option to purchase leases from the counterparties  over an option period  generally days  for the counterparties original cost of the leases plus an option fee 
strategically  these leasing arrangements have allowed the company to temporarily control important acreage positions during periods that the company has lacked sufficient capital to directly acquire such oil and gas leases 
since may  the company has acquired certain oil and gas leases through the aforementioned lease option arrangement with mr 
webster 
the acquisitions were made pursuant to a land option agreement between mr 
webster and the company dated january  the terms and conditions of this leasing arrangement with mr 
webster are consistent with leasing arrangements the company has entered into with the other third parties 
under the option agreement  mr 
webster agreed to acquire oil and gas leases in areas where the company is actively leasing or that it deems prospective 
on or before the th day from the date that mr 
webster acquires any lease in these areas  the company has the option to acquire these leases from mr 
webster for of mr 
webster s purchase price or  on the th day  pay a non refundable option extension fee to add a second day option period 
on or before the end of this second day option period  the company has the option to pay mr 
webster of his original purchase price to acquire the lease 
if  at the end of the second option period  the company has not exercised its purchase option  mr 
webster will retain ownership of the oil and gas leases 
in addition to the cash payments described above  the company will assign a one half of one percent of ths overriding royalty interest proportionally reduced to the actual net interest in any given lease acquired on any lease it acquires from mr 
webster in the first day option period and a one percent of ths overriding royalty interest also proportionally reduced on any lease acquired from mr 
webster in the second day option period 
as of december   mr 
webster has acquired oil and gas leases for approximately million  the company paid approximately million for leases from mr 
webster and the company has made option extension payments of approximately  to mr 
webster 
there are currently no outstanding lease options under our arrangement with mr 
webster 
the company may continue to use these arrangements as a strategic alternative 
effects of inflation and changes in price our results of operations and cash flows are affected by changing oil and natural gas prices 
if the price of oil and natural gas increases decreases  there could be a corresponding increase decrease in the operating cost that we are required to bear for operations  as well as an increase decrease in revenues 
inflation has had a minimal effect on us 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  including issues relating to financial statement recognition and measurement 
fin provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in the financial statements only if the position is more likely than not of being sustained if the position were to be challenged by a taxing authority 
the assessment of the tax position is based solely on the technical merits of the position  without regard to the likelihood that the tax position may be challenged 
if an uncertain tax position meets the more likely than not threshold  the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being recognized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority is recorded 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on our consolidated financial statements

is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently assessing whether we will early adopt sfas no 
as of the first quarter of fiscal as permitted  and are currently evaluating the impact adoption may have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
this statement amends statement  fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  fasb statement  and fasb statement no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  and other related accounting literature 
sfas no 
requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
this statement also requires employers to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position  with limited exceptions 
employers with publicly traded equity securities are required to initially recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and to provide the required disclosures as of the end of the fiscal year ending after december  we currently have no defined benefit or other postretirement plans subject to this standard 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas no 
applies to all entities and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently determining the impact  if any  that sfas no 
will have on our financial statements 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in their consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the adoption of sfas no 
r requires additional accounting and disclosure related to the income tax and cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangements 
sfas no 
r was effective beginning as of the first annual reporting period after june  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r during the first quarter of using the modified prospective method for transition and recognized approximately million in stock based compensation expense during summary of critical accounting policies the following summarizes several of our critical accounting policies 
see a complete list of significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the use of these estimates significantly affects our natural gas and oil properties through depletion and the full cost ceiling test  as discussed in more detail below 
significant estimates include volumes of oil and natural gas reserves used in calculating depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties  future net revenues and abandonment obligations  impairment of undeveloped properties  future income taxes and related assets liabilities  the collectability of outstanding accounts receivable  fair value of derivatives  stock based compensation expense  contingencies and the results of future and current litigation 
oil and natural gas reserve estimates  which are the basis for unit of production depletion and the ceiling test  have numerous inherent uncertainties 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
subsequent drilling results  testing and production may justify revision of such estimate 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  reserve estimates are vulnerable to changes in wellhead prices of crude oil and natural gas 
such prices have been volatile in the past and can be expected to be volatile in the future 
the significant estimates are based on current assumptions that may be materially effected by changes to future economic 
table of contents conditions such as the market prices received for sales of volumes of oil and natural gas  interest rates  the market value of our common stock and corresponding volatility and our ability to generate future taxable income 
future changes to these assumptions may affect these significant estimates materially in the near term 
oil and natural gas properties we account for investments in natural gas and oil properties using the full cost method of accounting 
all costs directly associated with the acquisition  exploration and development of natural gas and oil properties are capitalized 
these costs include lease acquisitions  seismic surveys  and drilling and completion equipment 
we proportionally consolidate our interests in natural gas and oil properties 
we capitalized compensation costs for employees working directly on exploration activities of million  million and million in  and respectively 
we expense maintenance and repairs as they are incurred 
we amortize natural gas and oil properties based on the unit of production method using estimates of proved reserve quantities 
we do not amortize investments in unproved properties until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until these investments are impaired 
we periodically evaluate  on a property by property basis  unevaluated properties for impairment 
if the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired  we add the amount of impairment to the proved natural gas and oil property costs to be amortized 
the amortizable base includes estimated future development costs and  where significant  dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of estimated salvage values 
the depletion rate per mcfe for  and was  and respectively 
we account for dispositions of natural gas and oil properties as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
we have not had any transactions that significantly alter that relationship 
the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are limited to a ceiling test based on the estimated future reserves  discounted at a per annum  from proved oil and natural gas reserves based on current economic and operating conditions the full cost ceiling 
if net capitalized costs exceed this limit  the excess is charged to operations through depreciation  depletion and amortization 
in connection with our year end ceiling test computation  a price sensitivity study also indicated that a percent increase or decrease in commodity prices at december  would have increased or decreased the full cost ceiling test cushion by approximately million 
the aforementioned price sensitivity is as of december  and  accordingly  does not include any potential changes in reserves due to first quarter performance  such as commodity prices  reserve revisions and drilling results 
the full cost ceiling cushion at the end of of approximately million was based upon average realized oil and natural gas prices of per bbl and per mcf  respectively  or a volume weighted average price of per boe 
this cushion  however  would have been zero on such date at an estimated volume weighted average price of per boe 
a boe means one barrel of oil equivalent  determined using the ratio of six mcf of natural gas to one bbl of oil  condensate or natural gas liquids  which approximates the relative energy content of oil  condensate and natural gas liquids as compared to natural gas 
prices have historically been higher or substantially higher  more often for oil than natural gas on an energy equivalent basis  although there have been periods in which they have been lower or substantially lower 
under the full cost method of accounting  the depletion rate is the current period production as a percentage of the total proved reserves 
total proved reserves include both proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves 
the depletion rate is applied to the net book value and estimated future development costs to calculate the depletion expense 
proved reserves materially impact depletion expense 
if the proved reserves decline  then the depletion rate the rate at which we record depletion expense increases  reducing net income 
we have a significant amount of proved undeveloped reserves 
we had bcfe  bcfe  and bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves  representing  and of our total proved reserves at december   and  respectively 
as of december   and  a portion of these proved undeveloped reserves  or approximately  bcfe  bcfe and bcfe  respectively  are attributable to our camp hill properties that we acquired in see business and properties east texas area camp hill project for further discussion of the camp hill properties 
the estimated future development costs to develop our proved undeveloped reserves on our camp hill properties are relatively low  on a per mcfe basis  when compared to the estimated future development costs to develop our proved undeveloped reserves on our other oil and natural gas properties 
furthermore  the average depletable life the estimated time that it will take to produce all recoverable reserves of our camp hill properties is considerably longer  or approximately years  when compared to the depletable life of our remaining oil and natural gas properties of approximately years 
accordingly  the combination of a relatively low ratio of 
table of contents future development costs and a relatively long depletable life on our camp hill properties has resulted in a relatively low overall historical depletion rate and dd a expense 
this has resulted in a capitalized cost basis associated with producing properties being depleted over a longer period than the associated production and revenue stream  causing the build up of nondepleted capitalized costs associated with properties that have been completely depleted 
this combination of factors  in turn  has had a favorable impact on our earnings  which have been higher than they would have been had the camp hill properties not resulted in a relatively low overall depletion rate and dd a expense and longer depletion period 
as a hypothetical illustration of this impact  the removal of our camp hill proved undeveloped reserves starting january  would have reduced our earnings by  i an estimated million in comprised of after tax charges for a million full cost ceiling impairment and a million depletion expense increase  ii an estimated million in due to higher depletion expense  iii an estimated million in due to higher depletion expense  iv an estimated million in due to higher depletion expense and v an estimated million in due to higher depletion expense 
we expect our relatively low historical depletion rate to continue until the high level of nonproducing reserves to total proved reserves is reduced and the life of our proved developed reserves is extended through development drilling and or the significant addition of new proved producing reserves through acquisition or exploration 
if our level of total proved reserves  finding cost and current prices were all to remain constant  this continued build up of capitalized costs increases the probability of a ceiling test write down 
we depreciate other property and equipment using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives ranging from five to years 
oil and natural gas reserve estimates the proved reserve data as of december  included in this document are estimates prepared by ryder scott company  laroche petroleum consultants  ltd  and fairchild wells  inc  independent petroleum engineers 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of hydrocarbons that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the process relies on judgment and the interpretation of available geologic  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions regarding drilling and operating expense  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the sec mandates some of these assumptions such as oil and natural gas prices and the present value discount rate 
proved reserve estimates prepared by others may be substantially higher or lower than our estimates 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may differ from actual results  reserve quantities actually recovered may be significantly different than estimated 
material revisions to reserve estimates may be made depending on the results of drilling  testing  and rates of production 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
our rate of recording depreciation  depletion and amortization expense for proved properties is dependent on our estimate of proved reserves 
if these reserve estimates decline  the rate at which we record these expenses will increase 
a increase or decrease in our proved reserves would have increased or decreased our depletion expense by for the year ended december  as of december   approximately of our proved reserves were proved undeveloped and proved nonproducing 
moreover  some of the producing wells included in our reserve reports as of december  had produced for a relatively short period of time as of that date 
because most of our reserve estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis  those estimates are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history 
volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure based on seismic analysis 
in addition  realization or recognition of our proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans 
lack of certainty with respect to development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved 
we have from time to time chosen to delay development of our proved undeveloped reserves in the camp hill field in east texas in favor of pursuing shorter term exploration projects with higher potential rates of return  adding to our lease position in this field and further evaluating additional economic enhancements for this field s development 
the average life of the camp hill proved undeveloped reserves is approximately years  with of these reserves being booked over nine years ago 
although we have increased the pace of the development of the camp hill project  there can be no assurance that the aforementioned discontinuance will not occur 

table of contents derivative instruments the company uses derivatives  typically fixed rate swaps and costless collars  to manage price and interest rate risk underlying our oil and gas production and the variable interest rate on the second lien credit facility 
for a discussion of the impact of changes in the prices of oil and gas on our hedging transactions  see volatility of oil and natural gas prices below 
the company s board of directors sets all of our risk management policies and reviews volume limitations  types of instruments and counterparties  on a quarterly basis 
these policies require that derivative instruments be executed only by either the president or chief financial officer after consultation and concurrence by the president  chief financial officer and chairman of the board 
the master contracts with the approved counterparties identify the president and chief financial officer as the only representatives authorized to execute trades 
the board of directors also reviews the status and results of derivative activities quarterly 
upon entering into a derivative contract  the company either designates the derivative instrument as a hedge of the variability of cash flow to be received cash flow hedge or the derivative must be accounted for as a non designated derivative 
all of the company s derivative instruments at december  and december  were treated as non designated derivatives and the unrealized gain loss related to the mark to market valuation was included in the company s earnings 
income taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  deferred income taxes are recognized at each year end for the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards  it is reduced by a valuation allowance 
however  despite our attempt to make an accurate estimate  the ultimate utilization of our deferred tax assets is highly dependent upon our actual production and the realization of taxable income in future periods 
contingencies liabilities and other contingencies are recognized upon determination of an exposure  which when analyzed indicates that it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or that a liability has been incurred and that the amount of such loss is reasonably estimable 
volatility of oil and natural gas prices our revenues  future rate of growth  results of operations  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital  as well as the carrying value of our properties  are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices of oil and natural gas 
see item a 
risk factors natural gas and oil prices are highly volatile  and lower prices will negatively affect our financial results 
we periodically review the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the commission 
see summary of critical accounting policies oil and natural gas properties and item a 
risk factors we may record ceiling limitation write downs that would reduce our shareholders equity 
to mitigate some of our commodity price risk  we engage periodically in certain other limited derivative activities including price swaps  costless collars and  occasionally  put options  in order to establish some price floor protection 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
total oil purchased and sold under swaps and collars during  and were  bbls   bbls and  bbls  respectively 
total natural gas purchased and sold under swaps and collars in  and were  mmbtu   mmbtu and  mmbtu  respectively 
the net gains losses realized by the company under such derivative arrangements were million  million and million for  and  respectively  and were included in net gain loss on derivatives 
as of december   and unrealized gains and losses on oil and gas derivatives of million  million and million  respectively  were included in net gain loss on derivatives 
while the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit our ability to benefit from increases in the prices of natural gas and oil 
we enter into the majority of our derivative transactions with two 
table of contents counterparties and have a netting agreement in place with those counterparties 
we do not obtain collateral to support the agreements but monitor the financial viability of counterparties and believe our credit risk is minimal on these transactions 
under these arrangements  payments are received or made based on the differential between a fixed and a variable product price 
these agreements are settled in cash at expiration or exchanged for physical delivery contracts 
in the event of nonperformance  we would again be exposed to price risk 
we have additional risk of financial loss because the price received for the product at the actual physical delivery point may differ from the prevailing price at the delivery point required for settlement of the hedging transaction 
moreover  our derivative arrangements generally do not apply to all of our production and thus provide only partial price protection against declines in commodity prices 
we expect that the amount of our hedges will vary from time to time 
our natural gas derivative transactions are generally settled based upon the average of the reporting settlement prices on the houston ship channel index for the last three trading days of a particular contract month 
our oil derivative transactions are generally settled based on the average reporting settlement prices on the west texas intermediate index for each trading day of a particular calendar month 
at december  we had the following outstanding derivative positions swaps collars average average average quarter mmbtu fixed price mmbtu floor price ceiling price first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter based on houston ship channel spot prices

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk 
our major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
the effects of such pricing volatility have been discussed above  and such volatility is expected to continue 
a fluctuation in the price received for oil and gas production would have an approximate million impact on our annual revenues 
to mitigate some of this risk  we engage periodically in certain limited hedging activities  including price swaps  costless collars and  occasionally  put options  in order to establish some price floor protection 
costs and any benefits derived from these price floors are accordingly recorded as a reduction or increase  as applicable  in oil and gas sales revenue and were not significant for any year presented 
the costs to purchase put options are amortized over the option period 
we do not hold or issue 
table of contents derivative instruments for trading purposes 
net gains and losses realized by us related to these instruments were million  million and million or  and per mmbtu for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to changes in interest rates results from our floating rate debt 
the result of a fluctuation in short term interest rates would have impacted cash flow by approximately million 
financial instruments and debt maturities 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and bank borrowings  including borrowings under our senior credit facility and second lien credit facility 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid nature of these short term instruments 
the fair values of the bank and vendor borrowings approximate the carrying amounts as of december  and  and were determined based upon interest rates currently available to us for borrowings with similar terms 
maturities of long term debt are million in each of the years through and the balance  or million  is due in
