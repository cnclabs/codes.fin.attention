item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this annual report 
all share and per share information has been restated to give effect to a two for one common stock split that became effective november  we are a diversified insurance agency  wholesale brokerage and services organization headquartered in daytona beach and tampa  florida 
since  our stated corporate objective has been to increase our net income per share by at least every year 
we have increased revenues from million in as originally stated  without giving effect to any subsequent acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting to million in  a compound annual growth rate of 
in the same period  we increased net income from million as originally stated  without giving effect to any subsequent acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting to million in  a compound annual growth rate of 
since  excluding the historical impact of poolings  our pre tax margins income before income taxes and minority interest divided by total revenues improved in all but one year  and in that year  the pre tax margin was essentially flat 
these improvements have resulted primarily from net new business growth new business production offset by lost business  revenues generated by acquisitions and continued operating efficiencies 
our revenue growth in was driven by i net new business growth  and ii the acquisition of agency entities and several books of business customer accounts  generating total annualized revenues of approximately million 
our commissions and fees revenue is comprised of commissions paid by insurance companies and fees paid directly by customers 
commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by the insured and are materially affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds underlying insurable exposure units  which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values  sales and payroll levels so as to determine what premium to charge the insured 
these premium rates are established by insurance companies based upon many factors  including reinsurance rates paid by insurance carriers  none of which we control 
beginning in and continuing through  commission revenues were adversely influenced by a consistent decline in premium rates resulting from intense competition among property and casualty insurance companies for market share 
this condition of a prevailing decline in premium rates  commonly referred to as a soft market  generally resulted in flat to reduced commissions on renewal business 
the effect of this softness in rates on our commission revenues was somewhat offset by our acquisitions and net new business production 
as a result of increasing loss ratios the comparison of incurred losses plus adjustment expenses against earned premiums of insurance companies through  there was a general increase in premium rates beginning in the first quarter of and continuing into during  the increases in premium rates began to moderate  and in certain lines of insurance  premium rates decreased 
in  as general premium rates continued to moderate  the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season since when hurricane andrew hit south florida 
the insured losses from the hurricane season were absorbed relatively easily by the insurance industry and the general insurance premium rates continued to soften during during the third quarter of  the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season ever recorded 
as a result of the significant losses incurred by the insurance carriers as the result of these hurricanes  the insurance premium rates in increased on coastal property  primarily in the southeastern region of the united states 
in the other regions of the united states  the insurance premium rates  in general  declined during the volume of business from new and existing insured customers  fluctuations in insurable exposure units and changes in general economic and competitive conditions further impact our revenues 
for example  the increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards have caused some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage 
conversely  level rates of inflation or general declines in economic activity could limit increases in the values of insurable exposure units 
our revenues have continued to grow as a result of an intense focus on net new business growth and acquisitions 
we anticipate that results of operations will continue to be influenced by these competitive and economic conditions in we also earn profit sharing contingent commissions  which are profit sharing commissions based primarily on underwriting results  but may also reflect considerations for volume  growth and or retention 
these commissions are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each year  based on underwriting results and other aforementioned considerations for the prior year s 
over the last three years profit sharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately of the previous year s total commissions and fees revenue 
profit sharing contingent commissions are included in our total commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of income in the year received 
the term core commissions and fees excludes profit sharing contingent commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold  and specific fee based services rendered 
recently  two national insurance carriers announced the replacement of the current loss ratio based profit sharing contingent commission calculation with a more guaranteed fixed based methodology 
the impact of such changes on our operations or financial position is not currently known 
fee revenues are generated primarily by our services division  which provides insurance related services  including third party claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers compensation and all lines liability arenas  as well as medicare set aside services 
in each of the past three years  fee revenues generated by the services division have declined as a percentage of our total commissions and fees  from in to in this declining trend is anticipated to continue as the revenues from our other reportable segments grow at a faster pace 
investment income consists primarily of interest earnings on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies 
our policy is to invest available funds in high quality  short term fixed income investment securities 
investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments 
acquisitions during  we acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of insurance intermediary operations and several books of business customer accounts 
the aggregate purchase price was million  including million of net cash payments  the issuance of million in notes payable and the assumption of million of liabilities 
these acquisitions had estimated aggregate annualized revenues of million 
during  we acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of insurance intermediary operations and several books of business customer accounts 
the aggregate purchase price was million  including million of net cash payments  the issuance of million in notes payable and the assumption of million of liabilities 
these acquisitions had estimated aggregate annualized revenues of million 
during  we acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of insurance intermediary operations  several books of business customer accounts and the outstanding stock of three general insurance agencies 
the aggregate purchase price was million  including million of net cash payments  the issuance of million in notes payable and the assumption of million of liabilities 
these acquisitions had estimated aggregate annualized revenues of million 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we continually evaluate our estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities  which values are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that  of our significant accounting policies see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following critical accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition commission revenues are recognized as of the effective date of the insurance policy or the date on which the policy premium is billed to the customer  whichever is later 
at that date  the earnings process has been completed  and we can reliably estimate the impact of policy cancellations for refunds and establish reserves accordingly 
management determines the policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted by known circumstances 
subsequent commission adjustments are recognized upon notification from the insurance companies 
profit sharing contingent commissions from insurance companies are recognized when determinable  which is when such commissions are received 
fee revenues are recognized as services are rendered 
business acquisitions and purchase price allocations we have significant intangible assets that were acquired through business acquisitions 
these assets consist of purchased customer accounts  noncompete agreements  and the excess of costs over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill 
the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of the purchase price to the intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  all of our business combinations initiated after june  have been accounted for using the purchase method 
in connection with these acquisitions  we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased  which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements 
purchased customer accounts partially include the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies  customers and other matters essential to policy renewals 
however  they primarily represent the present value of the underlying cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future renewal periods of the insurance policies comprising those purchased customer accounts 
the valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency  expenses and discount rates 
any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts 
noncompete agreements are valued based on the duration and any unique features of each specific agreement 
purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements are amortized on a straight line basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods  which range from five to years 
the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is no longer amortized  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

intangible assets impairment effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to lower of cost or market impairment testing 
sfas no 
requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
fair value is estimated based on multiples of revenues  and earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
management assesses the recoverability of our goodwill on an annual basis  and of our amortizable intangibles and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the following factors  if present  may trigger an impairment review i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  ii significant negative industry or economic trends  iii significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and iv significant decline in our market capitalization 
if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above referenced factors  an impairment analysis is performed 
management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to revise the assessment and  if appropriate  record an impairment charge 
we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november  and identified no impairment as a result of the evaluation 
stock based compensation the company grants stock options and non vested stock awards previously referred to as restricted stock to its employees  officers and directors 
effective january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  for its stock based compensation plans 
among other things  sfas r requires that compensation expense for all share based awards be recognized in the financial statements based upon the grant date fair value of those awards 
reserves for litigation we are subject to numerous litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable  an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
management  with the assistance of inside and outside counsel  determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues 
new developments or changes in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters may significantly affect the required reserves and impact our net income 
derivative instruments in  we entered into one derivative financial instrument an interest rate exchange agreement  or swap to manage the exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our million variable rate debt 
as of december   we maintained this swap agreement  whereby we pay a fixed rate on the notional amount to a bank and the bank pays us a variable rate on the notional amount equal to a base london interbank offering rate libor 
we have assessed this derivative as a highly effective cash flow hedge  and accordingly  changes in the fair market value of the swap are reflected in other comprehensive income 
the fair market value of this instrument is determined by quotes obtained from the related counter parties in combination with a valuation model utilizing discounted cash flows 
the valuation of this derivative instrument is a significant estimate that is largely affected by changes in interest rates 
if interest rates increase or decrease  the value of this instrument will change accordingly 
new accounting pronouncements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effects of the adoption of new accounting standards 
results of operations for the years ended december   and the following discussion and analysis regarding results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
financial information relating to our consolidated financial results is as follows in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change revenues commissions and fees profit sharing contingent commissions investment income other income  net total revenues expenses employee compensation and benefits non cash stock based compensation other operating expenses amortization depreciation interest total expenses income before income taxes net internal growth rate core commissions and fees employee compensation and benefits ratio other operating expenses ratio capital expenditures total assets at december commissions and fees commissions and fees revenue  including profit sharing contingent commissions  increased in  in and in profit sharing contingent commissions increased million to million in  primarily as a result of a better than average year for insurance companies loss ratios 
core commissions and fees revenue increased in  in and in  when excluding commissions and fees revenue generated from acquired operations and also from divested operations 
the results reflect the continued moderation of the insurance premium rate growth that began in in most regions of the united states  but offset by increases in the insurance premium rates for coastal property in the southeastern united states 
investment income investment income increased to million in  compared with million in and million in the increases in over  and over were primarily the result of higher investment yields earned each sequential year along with higher average available cash balances for each successive year 
other income  net other income consists primarily of gains and losses from the sale and disposition of assets 
in  gains of million were recognized from the sale of customer accounts as compared with million and million in and  respectively 
although we are not in the business of selling customer accounts  we periodically will sell an office or a book of business one or more customer accounts that does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth 
for these reasons  in  we sold all four of our retail offices in north dakota and our sole remaining operation in the medical third party administration services business 
employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits increased approximately in  in and in  primarily as a result of acquisitions and an increase in commissions paid on net new business 
employee compensation and benefits as a percentage of total revenues were in  in and in  reflecting a gradual improvement in personnel efficiencies as revenues grow 
we had  full time equivalent employees at december   compared with  at december  and  at december  non cash stock based compensation the company grants stock options and non vested stock awards to its employees  officers and directors 
effective january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  for its stock based compensation plans 
among other things  sfas r requires that compensation expense for all share based awards be recognized in the financial statements based upon the grant date fair value of those awards 
prior to january   the company accounted for stock based compensation using the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and related interpretations  and disclosure requirements established by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transitions and disclosures sfas 
under apb no 
 no compensation expense was recognized for either stock options issued under the company s stock compensation plans or for stock purchased under the company s employee stock purchase plan espp 
the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share for stock options and espp awards were instead disclosed in a footnote to the financial statements 
compensation expense was previously recognized for awards of non vested stock  based upon the market value of the common stock on the date of award  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period with the effect of forfeitures recognized as they occurred 
as such the and non cash stock based compensation expense of million and million  respectively  were solely related to the performance stock plan psp grants under apb for  the non cash stock based compensation under sfas r incorporates costs related to each of our three stock based plans as explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the million expense in consisted of million related to the psp plan  million related to the limited amount of incentive stock options issued and the remaining million relates to the espp 
other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues  other operating expenses increased to in from in and in legal and professional fee expenses increased million in over the amount expended in  which in turn was million greater than what was expended in the increase in legal and professional fee expenses was primarily the result of the various ongoing investigations and litigation relating to agent and broker compensation  including profit sharing contingent commissions  by state regulators and  to a lesser extent  by the requirements of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of additionally  in a total of million was paid to state of florida regulatory authorities and other parties  which concluded the state of florida s investigation of compensation paid to us see note 
excluding the impact of these increased legal and professional fee expenses and settlement payments  other operating expenses declined as a percentage of total revenues each year from to  which is attributable to the effective cost containment measures brought about by our initiative designed to identify areas of excess expense 
this decrease is also due to the fact that  in a net internal revenue growth environment  certain significant other operating expenses such as office rent  office supplies  data processing  and telephone costs  increase at a slower rate than commissions and fees revenue during the same period 
amortization amortization expense increased million  or in  million  or in  and million  or in the increases in and were due to the amortization of additional intangible assets as a result of acquisitions completed in those years 
depreciation depreciation increased in  in and in these increases were primarily due to the purchase of new computers  related equipment and software  and the depreciation of fixed assets associated with acquisitions completed in those years 
interest expense interest expense decreased million  or  in over as a result of lower average debt balances due to the normal quarterly principal payments 
interest expense increased million  or  in and million or in as a result of the funding of million of unsecured senior notes in the third quarter of income taxes the effective tax rate on income from operations was in  in and in the higher effective tax rate in and  compared with  was primarily the result of increased amounts of business conducted in states having higher state tax rates 
results of operations segment information as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we operate in four reportable segments the retail  national programs  wholesale brokerage and services divisions 
on a divisional basis  increases in amortization  depreciation and interest expenses are the result of acquisitions within a given division in a particular year 
likewise  other income in each division primarily reflects net gains on sales of customer accounts and fixed assets 
as such  in evaluating the operational efficiency of a division  management places emphasis on the net internal growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue  the gradual improvement of the ratio of total employee compensation and benefits to total revenues  and the gradual improvement of the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenues 
the internal growth rates for our core commissions and fees for the three years ended december   and  by divisional units are as follows in thousands  except percentages for the years ended december  total net change total net growth less acquisition revenues internal net growth florida retail national retail western retail total retail professional programs special programs total national programs wholesale brokerage services total core commissions and fees the reconciliation of the above internal growth schedule to the total commissions and fees included in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and is as follows in thousands  except percentages for the years ended december  total core commissions and fees contingent commissions divested business total commission fees for the years ended december  total net change total net growth less acquisition revenues internal net growth florida retail national retail western retail total retail professional programs special programs total national programs wholesale brokerage services total core commissions and fees the reconciliation of the above internal growth schedule to the total commissions and fees included in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and is as follows in thousands  except percentages for the years ended december  total core commissions and fees contingent commissions divested business total commission fees for the years ended december  total net change total net growth less acquisition revenues internal net growth florida retail national retail western retail total retail professional programs special programs total national programs wholesale brokerage services total core commissions and fees the reconciliation of the above internal growth schedule to the total commissions and fees included in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and is as follows in thousands  except percentages for the years ended december  total core commissions and fees contingent commissions divested business total commission fees the retail segment includes commissions and fees reported in the other column of the segment information in note which includes corporate and consolidation items 
retail division the retail division provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial  public and quasi public entity  professional and individual insured customers 
more than of the retail division s commissions and fees revenue are commission based 
since the majority of our other operating expenses do not change as premiums fluctuate  we believe that most of any fluctuation in the commissions that we receive will be reflected in our pre tax income 
the retail division s commissions and fees revenue accounted for of our total consolidated commissions and fees revenue in but declined to in  mainly due to continued acquisitions in the national programs and wholesale brokerage divisions 
financial information relating to brown brown s retail division is as follows in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change revenues commissions and fees profit sharing contingent commissions investment income other income  net total revenues expenses employee compensation and benefits non cash stock based compensation other operating expenses amortization depreciation interest total expenses income before income taxes net internal growth rate core commissions and fees employee compensation and benefits ratio other operating expenses ratio capital expenditures total assets at december the retail division s total revenues in increased million to million  a increase over of this increase  approximately million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in the remaining increase was primarily due to net new business growth

the net internal growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue for the retail division in was 
the increase in the net internal growth rate from core commission and fees from to primarily reflects increased premium rates for coastal property in the southeastern part of the united states  but offset by lower insurance premium rates in most other parts of the country 
income before income taxes in increased million to million  a increase over this increase was due to revenues from acquisitions  a positive net internal growth rate and the continued focus on holding our general expense growth rate to a lower percentage than our revenue growth rate

income before income taxes in increased million to million  a increase over this increase was due to revenues from acquisitions  a positive net internal growth rate and the continued focus on holding our general expense growth rate to a lower percentage than our revenue growth rate 
national programs division the national programs division is comprised of two units professional programs  which provides professional liability and related package products for certain professionals delivered through nationwide networks of independent agents  and special programs  which markets targeted products and services designated for specific industries  trade groups  public and quasi public entities and market niches

the majority of the internally generated growth in the core commissions and fees revenue was primarily related to increasing insurance premium rates in our condominium program at our florida intracoastal underwriters fiu profit center that occurred as a result of the and hurricane seasons as well as strong growth in the public entity business and the proctor financial operation 
the growth at fiu has been strong over the last two years  however  with changes made by the state of florida in early  it appears that fiu s revenues may be substantially less than income before income taxes in increased million to million  a increase over  of which the majority related to the revenues derived from acquisitions completed in and the increased earnings at fiu 
additionally  in a total of million was paid to state of florida regulatory authorities and other parties  which concluded the state of florida s investigation of compensation paid to us see note

the weaker internal growth rate than in recent years for the wholesale brokerage division was primarily the result of lower revenues from two of our operations 
one of those operations  which focuses on home building construction accounts in the western region of the united states  experienced a slow down in economic activity during the year as well as lower insurance premium rates 
the second operation was the personal lines wholesale brokerage arm of hull company which had significant premium capacity restrictions on placing coastal property coverage with their insurance carriers  which was not the case in income before income taxes in decreased million to million  a decrease over this decrease is attributable in part to axiom re and delaware valley underwriting agency operations acquired in  which had an aggregate loss before income taxes of million as a result of initial transitional issues and net lost business 
additionally  our operation that focuses on home building construction accounts in the western region of the united states had income before income taxes of million less than it earned in  due to the reduction of revenues mentioned above 
offsetting these losses were net increases in income before income taxes from our other wholesale brokerage operations 
total revenues in increased million to million  a increase over of this increase  approximately million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in the majority of this acquired revenue was from the march  acquisition of hull company  which represented the largest acquisition in our history

the wholesale brokerage division s net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue in was  excluding core commissions and fees revenue recognized in from new acquisitions 
the strong net internal growth rate was generated primarily from two of our operations  one of which focuses on property accounts in the southeastern united states  and the other which focuses on construction accounts in the western part of the united states
