item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and their notes contained in this annual report on form k 
overview of our business we are a leading provider of non hazardous solid waste collection and disposal services in the united states 
we provide solid waste collection services for commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers through collection companies in states 
we also own or operate transfer stations  solid waste landfills and recycling facilities 
we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations 
our remaining revenue is from other services including landfill disposal  recycling  compost  mulch and soil operations 
the following table reflects our revenue by source for the years ended december   and in millions years ended december  collection residential commercial industrial other total collection transfer and disposal less intercompany transfer and disposal  net other revenue our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers 
our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on long term contracts with municipalities 
we generally provide industrial and commercial collection services to individual customers under contracts with terms up to three years 
our revenue from landfill operations is from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties 
in general  we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials 
no one customer has individually accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years 
the cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and includes disposal  labor  self insurance  fuel and equipment maintenance costs 
it also includes capital costs for equipment and facilities 
we seek operating efficiencies by controlling the movement of waste from the point of collection through disposal 
during the three months ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of the total volume of waste we collected was disposed of at landfills we own or operate 
our landfill costs include daily operating expenses  costs of capital for cell development  costs for final capping  closure and post closure  and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance 
daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal  methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance  interim cap maintenance  and costs associated with the application of daily cover materials 
we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred 
we use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to cell development 
in life cycle accounting  certain direct costs are capitalized  and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of 
table of contents available airspace 
these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation  natural and synthetic liners  construction of leachate collection systems  installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems  installation of groundwater monitoring wells  and other costs associated with the acquisition and development of the site 
obligations associated with final capping  closure and post closure are capitalized  and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed 
cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 
these estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to adjust our rates used to expense capitalized costs 
changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs  available airspace  inflation and applicable regulations 
changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates  changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted

table of contents our operations are managed and reviewed through five regions that we designate as our reportable segments 
from to  operating income increased in all of our regions due to the successful execution of our pricing strategy 
compared to revenue in our eastern region increased during compared to due to price increases in our collection and landfill lines of business and due to increased volume in our industrial collection and landfill businesses 
this increase in revenue was partially offset by decreased volume in our commercial and residential collection businesses and by the sale of our operations in western new york during the three months ended march  operating margins decreased from to due to higher landfill operating and fuel costs partially offset by higher revenue 
in our central region  revenue increased during compared to due to price increases in our collection and landfill lines of business and volume growth in our landfill line of business arising from favorable economic conditions 
operating margins decreased primarily due to increased third party hauling costs associated with our company assuming responsibility for hauling waste from the city of toronto to one of our landfills in michigan 
this increase in costs was partially offset by adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with sfas our operations in the southern region experienced the greatest margin improvement of all of our segments because of price increases and volume growth in our collection and landfill lines of business 
operating margins increased because of an increase in revenue arising from favorable economic conditions  partially offset by higher fuel costs and adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with sfas operating margins also improved during because of higher costs incurred during the fourth quarter of related to hurricane clean up 
in our southwestern region  revenue increased due to price increases and volume growth in our collection and landfill lines of business  partially offset by the sale of our remediation and heavy construction services business during the fourth quarter of the increase in operating margins from to is attributable to an increase in revenue arising from improving economic conditions  partially offset by higher fuel costs and adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with sfas in our western region  revenue increased due to price increases and volume growth in our collection and landfill lines of business 
operating margins decreased from to because of higher fuel  labor and insurance costs  partially offset by an increase in revenue during and adjustments for landfill amortization expense associated with sfas the increase in operating costs for corporate entities from to is due to the expansion of our business  incremental costs associated with our adoption of sfas r  additional costs associated with our k plan resulting from an increase in the employer s matching contribution percentage and an increase in other incentive compensation 
compared to during the first quarter of  we divested of our operations in western new york which reduced revenue in our eastern region 
this reduction in revenue was almost completely offset by increases in prices 
operating margins improved because of increases in prices and lower average disposal costs resulting from the new york divestiture 
in our central region  price increases and acquisitions resulted in higher revenue during compared to operating margins decreased primarily due to higher fuel costs partially offset by lower subcontracting and third party hauling costs 
our operations in the southern region benefited from stronger volumes in our collection  transfer and landfill businesses 
operating margins decreased primarily due to higher fuel costs and higher costs 
table of contents incurred during the fourth quarter of related to hurricane clean up  partially offset by decreases in labor and maintenance costs resulting from operating efficiencies 
in our southwestern region  increased revenue resulting from increased prices and volumes was partially offset by a decrease in revenue at our remediation and heavy construction services business 
this business was sold in the fourth quarter of operating margins improved because of a decrease in subcontracting costs and due to adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with sfas in our western region  increases in prices and volumes in our collection  transfer and landfill operations resulted in higher revenue during compared to operating margins decreased because of higher fuel and disposal costs and because of adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with sfas the increase in operating loss for corporate entities from to is primarily due to higher compensation and other costs related to the expansion of our business  approximately million of costs associated with the exchange of unsecured notes during and million related to the acceleration of the vesting of all outstanding stock options in financial objectives in january  we publicly announced our objectives for the year 
these objectives included the following generating free cash flow a non gaap measure in the range of to million 
this guidance excluded federal tax payments for that had been deferred until february as a result of an internal revenue service notice issued in response to hurricane katrina 
in july  we increased our range of anticipated free cash flow to approximately to million 
using our free cash flow to repurchase our common stock under our existing million share repurchase programs 
generating diluted earnings per share of to 
we updated our earnings per share guidance in july to a new range of to per diluted share and in november to a new range of to per diluted share 
growing revenue from core operations by approximately  with attributable to price increases and attributable to volume growth 
purchasing approximately million of property and equipment 
business performance during  we exceeded all of our financial objectives 
our internal growth from core operations for was  with from price increases and from volume growth 
during  our revenue growth from core pricing continued to benefit from a broad based pricing initiative which we started during the fourth quarter of the broad based price increases we secured offset various escalating capital and operating costs  including fuel 
we experienced core volume growth in all lines of our business  including our residential collection business 
during  our core volume growth was negatively impacted by hurricane clean up efforts that took place during the fourth quarter of however  our geographic mix of business  which is concentrated in high growth markets  positively impacted our operating results 
as a result  during we were able to exceed the internal growth objectives we established at the beginning of the year 
our operating margins increased by 
from in to in during  improved pricing and continued focus on productivity improvements offset higher fuel and landfill operating costs 
during  we generated free cash flow of million consisting of cash provided by operating activities of million  less purchases of property and equipment of million  plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment of million 
our free cash flow was negatively impacted by an million federal 
table of contents tax payment for that had been deferred until february as a result of an internal revenue service notice issued in response to hurricane katrina 
excluding this federal tax payment  our free cash flow for would have been million which exceeded our original guidance 
during  we used our free cash flow to repurchase million shares of our common stock  or approximately of our outstanding shares  for million 
also  during the third quarter of  our board of directors increased our quarterly dividend to 
per share 
during  we generated diluted earnings per share of which significantly exceeded our initial objective 
financial objectives our financial objectives for assume no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter of specific guidance is as follows we expect to generate free cash flow in excess of of net income  or approximately million 
we anticipate using our free cash flow to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock under our existing million share repurchase program 
we also anticipate using our free cash flow to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends 
we anticipate diluted earnings of to per share 
in january  our board of directors approved a for stock split effective on march  for stockholders of record on march  adjusted for the for stock split  we anticipate earnings of to per share 
we are targeting internal growth from core operations to be approximately to  with approximately to attributable to price increases and approximately attributable to volume growth 
we anticipate purchasing approximately million of property and equipment  net of sales of property and equipment 
business initiatives our business initiatives for are generally a continuation of those initiated in prior years and are dependent on further standardizing our business processes and improving our systems 
ensuring that our people understand our initiatives and processes and are trained on our systems is essential to the overall success of our initiatives 
our business initiatives for are as follows pricing initiatives 
during the fourth quarter of  we implemented a broad based pricing initiative across all lines of our business 
the purpose of this initiative is to recover increasing costs and improve operating margins 
we realized the benefit of this initiative during the past several years and expect a continuing benefit during improve business integration 
during  we took a number of steps to further strengthen our business platform and improve our business integration 
in response to limited vertical integration opportunities  we divested of our operations in western new york 
we acquired a landfill in the dallas fort worth area which better integrated that marketplace 
in addition  we divested of our remediation and heavy construction services business because it did not complement our core business strategy 
we plan to continue to develop and implement strategies that improve the performance of locations and lines of business that are performing below the company s average 
to achieve this objective  we may purchase operations from  sell operations to or exchange operations with other companies in the future 
improve the quality of our revenue 
the first step in this process was completed in and included installing a standardized billing and operating system 
this system enables us to  among other things  stratify our customers to determine how our rates compare to current market pricing 
during  we implemented the second generation of this software which we call rsi rsi  our company s core business system  provides a variety of functionalities including customer service  dispatch  billing  sales analysis  account retention and route productivity analysis 
during  we completed the development of the next 
table of contents generation of our billing and operating system 
this system provides additional functionality to our operating locations and further standardizes our billing and operating processes 
during  we will continue to ensure that our operating personnel are properly trained on this system and using it as intended 
we currently monitor our return on investment by marketplace and have instituted a return on investment pricing model 
this model will eventually allow us to track our return on investment by customer 
we use a customer relationship management system 
this system improves the productivity of our sales force by helping to establish marketing priorities and track sales leads 
it also tracks renewal periods for potential commercial  industrial and franchise contracts 
during  we will continue to ensure our sales force is properly trained on this system and is using it as intended 
improve the productivity of our operations 
we use a grid productivity program that enables us to benchmark the performance of our drivers 
in addition  in our larger markets  we use a route optimization program to minimize drive times and improve operational density 
during  we will continue to update our disposal optimization metrics 
these metrics identify which local disposal option maximizes our return on invested capital and cash flow 
improve fleet management and procurement 
in february  we selected dossier as our fleet management and parts procurement system 
during  we implemented dossier at all of our significant hauling and landfill operations 
among other features  this system tracks parts inventories  generates automatic quantity order points and logs all maintenance work 
it allows us to capture and review information to ensure our preventive maintenance programs comply with manufacturers warranties and governmental regulations 
in addition  the purchase order module within this system allows us to cross reference purchasing information with our inventory 
during  we intend to further utilize this purchase order module to take advantage of volume discounts 
enhance operational and financial reporting systems 
we have several initiatives aimed at improving our operational and financial reporting systems 
the overall goal of these initiatives is to provide us with detailed information  prepared in a consistent manner  that will allow us to quickly analyze and act upon trends in our business 
one of our most significant systems is our enterprise wide general ledger package 
we successfully converted all of our locations to lawson general ledger software in and in successfully converted all of our locations to lawson fixed asset software 
during december  we successfully converted all of our locations to lawson enterprise wide human resource software 
this software provides a number of direct benefits including a reduction in payroll processing and compliance costs and integration into our general ledger software 
it also provides a number of indirect benefits including better information concerning labor and related costs and better control over employee related initiatives such as training 
all of the system initiatives mentioned above provide us with more consistent and detailed information  thus allowing us to make quicker and more informed business decisions 
in addition  all of our significant software applications are standardized and centralized at our data center in fort lauderdale  florida 
this standardization and centralization provides us with consolidated information concerning our operations across a variety of operational and financial disciplines 
it also significantly enhances our ability to execute our disaster recovery plan 
expand our safety training programs 
as part of our ongoing emphasis on safe work practices and in light of increasing insurance costs  we expanded our safety training programs in during  we distributed a comprehensive training and safety manual to all of our locations 
safety will continue to be a key area of focus during 
table of contents critical accounting policies  judgments and disclosures our consolidated financial statements have been prepared using us generally accepted accounting principles and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management 
the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows  and may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain subjective or disclosure policy description complex judgments reference landfill accounting life cycle accounting we use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain landfill costs over the life of the site 
in life cycle accounting  all costs to acquire and construct a site are capitalized  and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace 
obligations associated with final capping  closure and post closure are capitalized  and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed 
cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 
changes in these estimates could significantly affect our amortization  depletion and accretion expense 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations landfill and environmental matters 
note  landfill and environmental costs in the consolidated financial statements 
probable expansion airspace we include in our calculation of total available airspace expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood that the expansion area will ultimately be permitted 
we have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace 
we believe that satisfying each of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted 
however  because some of these criteria are judgmental  they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted 
in either of these scenarios  our amortization  depletion and accretion expense could change significantly

note  landfill and environmental costs in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents subjective or disclosure policy description complex judgments reference final capping  closure and post closure we account for our final capping  closure and post closure activities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
under sfas  obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event 
obligations related to closure and post closure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire landfill life 
landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the units of consumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed throughout the entire landfill  depending on the nature of the obligation 
all obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value 
fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and the company s credit adjusted  risk free rate 
future costs for final capping  closure and post closure are developed at least annually by engineers  and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections 
changes in any of these estimates could affect our amortization of final capping  closure and post closure costs and our accretion expense 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations landfill and environmental matters and selected balance sheet accounts 
note  landfill and environmental costs in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents subjective or disclosure policy description complex judgments reference self insurance our insurance programs for worker s compensation  general liability  vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits are effectively self insured 
self insurance accruals are based on claims reported and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported 
estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported are developed actuarially 
if actual claims experience or development is significantly different than our estimates  our self insurance expense would change 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations selected balance sheet accounts 
note  commitments and contingencies in the consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment expenditures for improvements  repairs and maintenance expenditures for major additions and improvements to facilities are capitalized 
all expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred 
whether certain expenditures improve an asset or lengthen its useful life is subject to our judgment 
accordingly  the actual useful lives of our assets could differ from our estimates

allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts  represents their estimated net realizable value 
provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded based on historical collection experience  the age of the receivables  specific customer information and economic conditions 
in general  reserves are provided for accounts receivable in excess of days old 
accounts receivable are written off when they are deemed uncollectible 
establishing reserves against specific accounts receivable and the overall adequacy of our accounts receivable reserve is a matter of judgment 
if our judgment and estimates concerning the adequacy of our reserve for accounts receivable is incorrect  bad debt expense would change

 accounting for income taxes 
accordingly  deferred taxes have been provided to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
after the initial recognition of a deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is provided if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and the realizability of net operating losses for tax purposes are based on our judgment 
if our judgment and estimates concerning valuation allowances and the realizability of net operating losses are incorrect  our provision for income taxes would change

business combinations we make decisions to acquire or invest in businesses based on financial and strategic considerations 
businesses acquired are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
we acquired various solid waste businesses during the years ended december   and the aggregate purchase prices we paid for these transactions was million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  during  we entered into a million capital lease related to a landfill 
we divested of our operations in western new york during the three months ended march  and received proceeds of million 
a gain of million was recorded in on the divestiture 
in addition  during the three months ended december   we sold our environmental remediation company and received proceeds of million 
a loss of million was recorded in on the divestiture 
cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired goodwill for acquisitions totaled million 
as of december  we had goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  of  million 
goodwill for acquisitions totaled million 
as of december   we had goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  of  million 
million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace during when a landfill is acquired as part of a group of assets  purchase price is allocated to airspace based on the discounted expected future cash flows of the landfill relative to the other assets within the acquired group and is adjusted for other landfill assets and liabilities acquired which are primarily for final capping  closure and post closure obligations 
landfill purchase price is amortized using the units of consumption method over total available airspace  which includes probable expansion airspace where appropriate 

table of contents goodwill for acquisitions totaled million 
as of december   we had goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  of  million 
million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace 
consolidated results of operations years ended december   and our net income was million for the year ended december   or per diluted share  as compared to million  or per diluted share  in and million  or per diluted share  in during the year ended december   we recorded a million net income tax benefit in our provision for income taxes 
this benefit relates to the resolution of various income tax matters including the effective completion of federal tax audits for the years through we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  effective january  using the modified prospective transition method 
as a result of adopting sfas r  we recorded million of incremental equity based compensation expense during the year ended december  in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of adopting sfas r

this hauling service is provided to the city at a rate that approximates our cost 
b represents new taxes levied on landfill volumes in certain states that are passed on to customers 
during the year ended december   our revenue growth continued to benefit from a broad based pricing initiative which we started during the fourth quarter of we experienced core volume growth in our collection and landfill lines of business 
this core volume growth was partially offset by hurricane clean up efforts that took place during the fourth quarter of during the year ended december   our revenue growth from core pricing continued to benefit from our broad based pricing initiative 
during the year ended december   we experienced core volume growth in our residential collection  industrial collection and landfill businesses 
our core volume growth was also positively impacted by hurricane clean up efforts 
in june  we began assessing environmental fees on the non franchise portion of our customer base 
during the year ended december   our revenue growth from core pricing benefited from our broad based pricing initiative 
during the year ended december   we experienced core volume growth in all lines of our business  including our residential collection business resulting from the addition of several new municipal contracts  and our landfill and transfer station businesses resulting from newly opened sites and new contracts 
outlook we anticipate internal growth from core operations to be approximately to during assuming no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter of however  our price and volume growth may remain flat or may decline in depending on economic conditions and our success in implementing pricing initiatives 
cost of operations 
cost of operations was  million   million and  million  or  as a percentage of revenue   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively

changes in design typically include significant modifications to a landfill s footprint or vertical slopes 
at december   of our total available airspace  or million cubic yards  consisted of probable expansion airspace at fifteen of our landfills 
at december   of our total available airspace  or million cubic yards  consisted of probable expansion airspace at eight of our landfills 
this decrease in probable expansion airspace demonstrates our continued success in obtaining permits for expansion airspace 
during  total available airspace decreased by million cubic yards primarily due to airspace consumption  partially offset by permits granted and changes in engineering estimates

as of december   we owned or operated solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be billion in place cubic yards 
total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace 
these estimates are developed at least annually by engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial surveys 
as of december   total available disposal capacity is estimated to be billion in place cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 
billion in place cubic yards of probable expansion airspace 
before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and  therefore  included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity  it must meet all of our expansion criteria 
see note  landfill and environmental costs  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
as of december   eight of our landfills meet all of our criteria for including probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity 
at projected annual volumes  these eight landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of years  including probable expansion airspace 
the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is years

table of contents during the twelve months ended december   and  our weighted average compaction rate was approximately  pounds per cubic yard based on our three year historical moving average 
our compaction rates may improve as a result of the settlement and decomposition of waste 
as of december   we expect to spend an estimated additional billion on existing landfills  primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures  over their expected remaining lives 
our total expected investment  excluding non depletable land  estimated to be billion  or per cubic yard  is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the units of consumption method

table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the table below provides information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement

free cash flow we define free cash flow  which is not a measure determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
our free cash flow for the years ended december   and is calculated as follows in millions cash provided by operating activities purchases of property and equipment proceeds from sales of property and equipment free cash flow free cash flow for the year ended december  was negatively affected by an million federal tax payment that had been deferred until february as a result of an internal revenue service notice issued in response to hurricane katrina 
free cash flow for the year ended december  was higher than the other years presented primarily because of a million federal tax payment that was deferred 
during february  we paid million of these deferred taxes 
we believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment  net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment 
it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service  investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in 
table of contents our customer base and services provided  pursuing strategic acquisitions that augment our existing business platform  repurchasing shares of common stock at prices that provide value to our stockholders  paying cash dividends  maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing debt 
in addition  free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation 
the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations 
free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments 
our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 
seasonality and severe weather our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation  delay the collection and disposal of waste  reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites  or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no

the interpretation applies to all tax positions within the scope of statement of financial accounting standards no

the interpretation is mandatory for years beginning after december   accordingly  we will adopt the interpretation effective january  the cumulative effect of adopting the interpretation will be recorded in retained earnings and other accounts as applicable 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the effects of this new accounting standard 
we do not believe that the adoption of the interpretation will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas will be effective for our company beginning january  we are currently in the process of assessing the provisions of sfas and determining how this framework for measuring fair value will affect our current accounting policies and procedures and our financial statements 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
there are no other new accounting pronouncements that are significant to our company
