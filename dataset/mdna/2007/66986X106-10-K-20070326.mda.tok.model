item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and result of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this transition report on form k 
the discussion includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth in item a 
risk factors of this transition report on form k  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
general novadel pharma inc is a specialty pharmaceutical company developing oral spray formulations of a broad range of marketed treatments 
our oral spray therapeutics are administered by a novel application drug delivery system for presently marketed prescription  over the counter  or otc  and veterinary drugs 
this patented and patent pending delivery system is an oral spray potentially enabling drug absorption through the oral mucosa  potentially increasing the benefits of clinically proven compounds  including more rapid absorption into the bloodstream than presently available oral delivery systems 
our proprietary delivery system potentially enhances and accelerates the onset of the therapeutic benefits within minutes of administration 
our development efforts for our proprietary novel drug delivery system are concentrated on making such system available for drugs that are already available and proven in the marketplace 
we believe that our proprietary drug delivery system could offer the following significant advantages i more rapid delivery of drugs to the bloodstream allowing for quicker onset of therapeutic effects compared to conventional oral dosage forms  ii increased bioavailability of a drug by avoiding metabolism by the liver  iii improved drug safety profile by reducing the required dosage  including possible reduction of side effects  iv improved dosage reliability  v allowing medication to be taken without water  vi avoiding the need to swallow as is the case with many medications  and vii improved patient convenience and compliance 
currently  we have eight patents which have been issued in the us and patents which have been issued outside of the us additionally  we have over patents pending around the world 
we look for drug compounds that are off patent or are coming off patent in the near future  and we reformulate these compounds in conjunction with our proprietary drug delivery method 
once reformulated  we file for new patent applications on these reformulated compounds that comprise our product candidates 
our patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications with claims directed to the pharmaceutical formulations  methods of use and methods of manufacturing of a number of our product candidates 
since inception  substantially all of our revenues have been derived from consulting activities  primarily in connection with product development for various pharmaceutical companies 
more recently  we have begun to derive revenues from license fees and milestone payments stemming from our partnership agreements 
our future growth and profitability will be principally dependent upon our ability to successfully develop our products and to market and distribute the final products either internally or with the assistance of a strategic partner 
on june   our board of directors approved a change of our fiscal year end from july to december accordingly  the new fiscal year will begin on january and end on december we have filed this transition report on form k for the five months ended december  highlights for the five months ended december   and additionally through the date of filing of this transition report on form k  include the following product development and business achievements announced that nitromist nitroglycerin lingual aerosol has been approved by the fda for acute relief of an attack or acute prophylaxis of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease 
nitromist is our first product approval utilizing its proprietary oral spray technology 
announced positive study results of a pharmacokinetic study in humans of our oral spray formulation of sumatriptan  a study which demonstrated that sumatriptan oral spray achieves a statistically significant faster rate of absorption than imitrex sumatriptan tablets 
announced positive study results of a pharmacokinetic study in humans of our oral spray formulation of zolpidem  a study which demonstrated that zolpidem oral spray achieves a statistically significant faster rate of absorption than ambien zolpidem tablets 
announced the submission of a nda for zensana by novadel s partner  hana biosciences  inc  or hana biosciences  and the subsequent acceptance of such nda by the fda 
announced that hana biosciences has notified us that ongoing scale up and stability experiments indicate that there is a need to make adjustments to the formulation and or manufacturing process  and that there will be a delay in the fda approval and commercial launch of zensana tm 
added two new central nervous system product candidates to our development pipeline  including tizanidine oral spray potentially for spasticity and ropinirole oral spray potentially for parkinson s disease 
issued an additional patent in canada which further strengthens our intellectual property position in the oral delivery of pharmaceuticals 
the issued patents cover the use of multiple classes of drugs in oral sprays  including those for the treatment of pain  and for central nervous system disorders under our oral spray delivery system 
completed a private placement in december of our common stock  raising gross proceeds of approximately million

cohen will no longer serve as vice president  business and new product development 
drug development in the us and most countries throughout the world is a process that includes several steps defined by the us food and drug administration  or fda  or comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries 
the fda approval processes relating to new drugs differ  depending on the nature of the particular drug for which approval is sought 
with respect to any drug product with active ingredients not previously approved by the fda  a prospective drug manufacturer is required to submit an nda  which includes complete reports of pre clinical  clinical and laboratory studies to prove such product s safety and efficacy 
prior to submission of the new drug application  or nda  it is necessary to submit an investigational new drug  or ind  to obtain permission to begin clinical testing of the new drug 
given that our current product candidates are based on a new technology for formulation and delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredients that have been previously approved and that have been shown to be safe and effective in previous clinical trials  we believe that we will be eligible to submit what is known as a b nda 
we estimate that the development of new formulations of our pharmaceutical product candidates  including formulation  testing and submission of an nda  will take two to three years for the b nda process and will require significantly lower investments in direct research and development expenditures than is the case for the discovery and development of new chemical entities 
however  our estimates may prove to be inaccurate  or pre marketing approval relating to our proposed products may not be obtained on a timely basis  if at all  and research and development expenditures may significantly exceed management s expectations 
it is not anticipated that we will generate any revenues from royalties or sales of our product candidates until regulatory approvals are obtained and marketing activities begin 
any one or more of our product candidates may not prove to be commercially viable  or if viable  may not reach the marketplace on a basis consistent with our desired timetables  if at all 
the failure or the delay of any one or more of our proposed products to achieve commercial viability would have a material adverse effect on us 
the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
estimates of the nature  timing and estimated expenses of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  and the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from  any of our product candidates are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including the scope  rate of progress and expense of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  results of future clinical trials  the expense of clinical trials for additional indications  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the expense and timing of regulatory approvals  the expense of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  the effect of competing technologies and market developments  and the expense of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
we expect to continue to spend significant amounts on the development of our product candidates and we expect our costs to increase as we continue to develop and ultimately commercialize our product candidates 
over the next fiscal year  we expect to devote the majority of our research and development resources to the following product candidates nitromist nitroglycerin lingual aerosol 
this product candidate is indicated for acute relief of an attack or acute prophylaxis of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease 
we have partnered with par pharmaceutical  inc  or par  who has exclusive rights to market  sell and distribute nitromist in the us and canada 
on june   we received an approvable letter from the fda regarding our nda for nitromist 
the fda is not requiring any additional clinical studies for approval  but has requested that we complete certain manufacturing process validation commitments 
on april   we submitted the additional documentation to the fda for the manufacturing process validation commitments 
on may   we announced that the fda had accepted our submission regarding our nda as a complete response and  further  that the fda indicated a target date of november  for action on the submission 
on november   we announced that we received an approval letter from the fda regarding our nda for nitromist for which we received a milestone payment from par 
we are currently working with par to finalize the commercialization strategy for this product 
we will receive royalty payments based upon a percentage of net sales 
zolpidem oral spray 
zolpidem is the active ingredient in ambien  the leading hypnotic marketed by sanofi aventis 
we are currently targeting an nda submission for our zolpidem product candidate in the first half of calendar if this timeline is met  we may obtain final approval from the fda in calendar sumatriptan oral spray 
sumatriptan is the active ingredient in imitrex which is the largest selling migraine remedy marketed by glaxosmithkline  or gsk 
we are currently targeting a nda submission for our sumatriptan product candidate in the second half of calendar if this timeline is met  we may obtain final approval from the fda in calendar  however  we will not be able to launch this product candidate until after the expiration of the relevant imitrex patents and extensions thereof in february tizanidine oral spray 
tizanidine is indicated for the treatment of spasticity  a symptom of several neurological disorders  including multiple sclerosis  spinal cord injury  stroke and cerebral palsy  which leads to involuntary tensing  stiffening and contracting of muscles 
tizanidine treats spasticity by blocking nerve impulses through pre synaptic inhibition of motor neurons 
this method of action results in decreased spasticity without a corresponding reduction in muscle strength 
because patients experiencing spasticity may have difficulty swallowing the tablet formulation of the drug  our tizanidine oral spray may provide patients suffering from spasticity with a very convenient solution to this serious treatment problem 
we are currently targeting an nda submission for our tizanidine product candidate in calendar if this timeline is met  we may obtain final approval from the fda in calendar ropinirole oral spray 
ropinirole is indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic parkinson s disease 
ropinirole oral spray is ideal for the geriatric population who may be suffering from dysphagia difficulty swallowing  of sufferers of parkinson s are years of age or older and it is estimated that of elderly people have some difficulty in swallowing 
our formulation of ropinirole oral spray may represent a more convenient way for the patient or healthcare provider to deliver ropinirole to patients suffering stiffness and or tremors 
we are currently targeting a nda submission for our ropinirole product candidate in calendar if this timeline is met  we may obtain final approval from the fda in calendar we will also support our partners  as necessary  with the following product candidates and opportunities although we do not expect to devote a significant amount of corporate resources to such activities zensana ondansetron oral spray 
ondansetron is the active ingredient in zofran  the leading anti emetic marketed by gsk 
our partner for zensana  hana biosciences  is overseeing all clinical development and regulatory approval activities for this product in the us and canada 
in january  hana biosciences announced positive study results of a pivotal clinical trial for zensana 
hana biosciences submitted its nda on june  and such nda was accepted for review by the fda in august previously  hana biosciences targeted final approval from the fda and commercial launch in calendar however  on february   we announced that hana biosciences notified us that ongoing scale up and stability experiments indicate that there is a need to make adjustments to the formulation and or manufacturing process  and that there is likely to be a delay in the fda approval and commercial launch of zensana as a result thereof 
on march   hana biosciences announced its plan to withdraw  without prejudice  its pending nda for zensana with the fda  and that it plans to re direct the development plan for zensana using our patent protected european formulation of the product 
subject to the successful scale up and manufacturing tests of our european formulation of ondansetron  hana biosciences expects to conduct the appropriate clinical trials and re file the nda for zensana in because we rely upon hana biosciences to develop and file the nda for zensana we can give no assurances as to the amount of delay resulting from hana biosciences re directing the development plan relating to zensana or that hana biosciences will be able to re file the nda for zensana in  if at all  and ultimately receive final fda approval 
we will receive a milestone payment from hana biosciences upon final approval from the fda 
in addition  we will receive royalty payments based upon a percentage of net sales 
we retain the rights to our ondansetron oral spray outside of the us and canada 
propofol oral spray 
propofol is the active ingredient in diprivan  a leading intravenous anesthetic marketed by astrazeneca 
we continue to support our partner  manhattan pharmaceuticals  inc  or manhattan pharmaceuticals  who will oversee all clinical development and regulatory approval for this product 
our partner has not provided guidance regarding the clinical and regulatory development plan for this product candidate 
our veterinary initiatives are being carried out largely by our partner  velcera pharmaceuticals  inc  or velcera 
our partner has not provided guidance regarding the clinical and regulatory development plan for the potential veterinary product candidates 
as discussed above  certain of our product candidates are in early stages of clinical development and some are in preclinical testing 
these product candidates are continuously evaluated and assessed and are often subject to changes in formulation and technology 
as a result  these product candidates are subject to a more difficult  time consuming and expensive regulatory path in order to commence and complete the preclinical and clinical testing of these product candidates as compared to other product candidates in later stages of development 
critical accounting policies use of estimates the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us this requires our management to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses which in the normal course of business are subsequently adjusted to actual results 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements giving due regard to materiality 
revenue recognition we receive revenue from consulting services and license agreements 
consulting revenues from contract clinical research are recognized in the period in which the services are rendered  provided that collection is reasonably assured 
upfront license agreement payments are initially deferred and subsequently amortized into revenue over the contractual period 
milestone payments related to license agreements are recognized as revenue when earned 
stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r  which revises accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and superseded accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb  which provided for the use of the intrinsic value method of accounting for employees stock options 
sfas r required all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first quarter of the first annual reporting period that began after june  under sfas r  the use of the intrinsic value method and pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we have adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  effective august  and have selected the black scholes method of valuation for share based compensation 
sfas r requires that compensation cost be recorded as earned for all unvested stock options outstanding at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r and for all options granted after the date of adoption 
the charge is being recognized in research and development and consulting  selling  general and administrative expenses over the remaining service period after the adoption date based on the original estimate of fair value of the options as of the grant date 
for the five months ended december  and  we recorded share based compensation of approximately  or per share and  or per share  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended july   we recorded share based compensation expense of approximately million or per share 
we will continue to incur share based compensation charges in future periods 
as of december   unamortized stock based compensation expense of million remains to be recognized  which is comprised of million to be recognized over a weighted average period of years  million related to restricted stock to be recognized over a weighted average period of years  and million related to performance based stock options which vest upon reaching certain milestones 
expenses related to the performance based stock options will be recognized if and when the company determines that it is probable that the milestone will be reached 
as a result of cashless exercise provisions in our employee stock option agreements  we used variable accounting treatment under the financial accounting standards board s interpretation  for issued and outstanding stock options from january through july on october   our board of directors rescinded the cashless exercise provision for all of our outstanding option grants 
through july   variable plan accounting continued to be applied for approximately  outstanding options  for which option exercise prices were modified from the original agreement 
the following table illustrates the pro forma effect on the company s net loss and net loss per share as if the company had adopted the fair value based method of accounting for share based compensation under sfas for the fiscal years ended july  and fiscal year ended july  net loss as reported compensation credit resulting from variable plan accounting total share based employee compensation expense using the fair value based method for all awards pro forma net loss basic and diluted net loss per common share as reported pro forma net loss research and development expenses research and development expenses are expensed as incurred 
results of operations five months ended december  and license fees and milestone fees earned from related parties for the five months ended december  were  as compared to  for the five months ended december  the increase is primarily due to milestone payments received in connection with our license and development agreements for zensana with hana biosciences and nitromist with par pharmaceuticals 
consulting revenues from related parties for the five months ended december  were as compared to  for the five months ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to lower levels of revenue from velcera related to veterinary products 
research and development expenses for the five months ended december  were  as compared to  for the five months ended december  research and development costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits  contractor and consulting fees  clinical drug supplies of preclinical and clinical development programs  consumable research supplies and allocated facility and administrative costs 
below is a summary of our research and development expenses for the five months ended december  and nitromist zolpidem sumatriptan zensana propofol alprazolam tizanidine ropinirole other research and development costs internal costs total research and development expenses in the preceding table  research and development expenses are set forth in the following categories nitromist  zolpidem  sumatriptan  tizanidine and ropinirole third party direct project expenses relating to the development of the respective product candidates 
we expect to devote the majority of our research and development resources to our zolpidem and sumatriptan product candidates and expect that costs associated with these product candidates should increase in future periods  zensana and propofol third party direct project expenses relating to the development of zensana 
as our partners  hana biosciences and manhattan pharmaceuticals  are overseeing all clinical development and regulatory approval activities for these product candidates  we do not expect to devote a significant amount of resources to these product candidates  alprazolam third party direct project expenses relating to the development of our alprazolam oral spray product candidate 
we have determined that  in order to devote sufficient resources to other product candidates  it is appropriate to defer further efforts on alprazolam  other research and development costs direct expenses not attributable to a specific product candidate  and internal costs costs related primarily to personnel and overhead 
we do not allocate these expenses to specific product candidates as these costs relate to all research and development activities 
research and development expenses in the five months ended december  increased primarily as a result of the following items  increase related to the establishment of a reserve for certain raw materials and process validation batches for our nitromist product candidate   increase primarily related to product development and clinical trial costs for our zolpidem product candidate   increase primarily related to product development costs for our tizanidine product candidate  and  decrease related to clinical trail material costs for zensana incurred during the five months ended december  such costs did not recur during the five months ended december  consulting  selling  general and administrative expenses for the five months ended december  were  as compared to  for the five months ended december  consulting  selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  legal and other administrative personnel  recruitment expenses  professional fees and other corporate expenses 
the decrease in consulting  selling  general and administrative costs is primarily related to lower payroll and other personnel related costs during the period  partially offset by higher costs associated with external consultants 
total costs and expenses for the five months ended december  were  as compared to  for the five months ended december  primarily due to the increase in research and development expenses  partially offset by the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses noted above 
interest income for the five months ended december  was  as compared to  for the five months ended december  due to higher average cash and short term investment balances and a general increase in interest rates 
income tax benefit for the five months ended december  was  as compared to  for the five months ended december  these increased income tax benefits resulted from the sale of our new jersey net operating losses 
the resulting net loss for the five months ended december  was  as compared to  for the five months ended december fiscal years ended july  and license fees and milestone fees earned from related parties for the fiscal year ended july  were  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended july  the increase is primarily due to milestone payments received in connection with our license and development agreement for ondansetron with hana biosciences 
consulting revenues from related parties for the fiscal year ended july  were  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended july  the decrease is primarily attributable to lower levels of revenue from velcera and manhattan pharmaceuticals  related to veterinary products and propofol  respectively 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended july  were  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended july  research and development costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits  contractor and consulting fees  clinical drug supplies of preclinical and clinical development programs  consumable research supplies and allocated facility and administrative costs

as our partners  hana biosciences and manhattan pharmaceuticals  are overseeing all clinical development and regulatory approval activities for these product candidates  we do not expect to devote a significant amount of resources to these product candidates  alprazolam third party direct project expenses relating to the development of our alprazolam oral spray product candidate 
we have determined that  in order to devote sufficient resources to other product candidates  it is appropriate to defer further efforts on alprazolam  other research and development costs direct expenses not attributable to a specific product candidate  and internal costs costs related primarily to personnel and overhead 
we do not allocate these expenses to specific product candidates as these costs relate to all research and development activities 
research and development expenses in the fiscal year ended july  increased primarily as a result of the following items  increase related to process validation and method transfer activities for our nitromist product candidate   increase primarily related to product development costs for our zolpidem product candidate   increase primarily related to product development costs for our sumatriptan product candidate   increase related to other research and development costs primarily as a result of higher lab supplies expense   decrease related to our alprazolam product candidate as we have decided to defer further efforts on this product candidate  and  decrease related to internal costs primarily as a result of lower headcount in the fiscal year ended july   as compared to the fiscal year ended july  consulting  selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended july  were  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended july  consulting  selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  legal and other administrative personnel  recruitment expenses  professional fees and other corporate expenses 
the increase in consulting  selling  general and administrative costs is primarily related to the following items  non cash charge in the fiscal year ended july  for stock compensation expense   decrease in outside legal costs  and  decrease attributable to a non cash charge recorded in the fiscal year ended july  for restricted shares of our common stock awarded to a consultant 
total costs and expenses for the fiscal year ended july  were  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended july  primarily due to the net increases in research and development and selling general and administrative expenses noted above 
interest income for the fiscal year ended july  was  as compared to  for fiscal year ended july  due to a general increase in interest rates 
income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended july  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended july  these benefits resulted from the sale of our new jersey net operating losses 
the resulting net loss for the fiscal year ended july  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended july fiscal years ended july  and license fees and milestone payments increased to  in the fiscal year ended july  from  in the fiscal year ended july  primarily due to the signing of new partnership agreements with hana biosciences and velcera in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended july  consulting revenues for the fiscal year ended july  decreased to  in the fiscal year ended july  from  in the fiscal year ended july  primarily as a result of lower revenue from our arrangement with manhattan pharmaceuticals  partially offset by revenue associated with the company s arrangement with velcera 
research and development expenses increased approximately  to  from  for the fiscal year ended july  research and development costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits  contractor fees  clinical drug supplies of preclinical and clinical development programs  consumable research supplies and allocated facility and administrative costs 
the increase in research and development expenses is primarily related to the following items approximate  increase  primarily related to pharmacokinetic studies completed in the fiscal year ended july  for three of our priority product candidates  including i zolpidem ambien  ii ondansetron zofran  and iii alprazolam xanax  approximate  increase  primarily related to outsourced manufacturing fees associated with process validation and method transfer activities for our nitromist product candidate  approximate  increase due to higher payroll and allocated facility and administrative costs  primarily as a result of an increase in research and development related personnel in the fiscal year ended july   and approximate  decrease in research and development related consultants expense 
consulting  selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately  to  from  for the fiscal year ended july  consulting  selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  legal and other administrative personnel  recruitment expenses  professional fees and other corporate expenses 
the increase in consulting  selling  general and administrative costs is primarily related to the following items approximate  increase in outside legal costs  primarily related to the filing of additional patent applications in the fiscal year ended july   approximate  increase in compensation expense related to variable accounting for stock options 
in the fiscal year ended july   we recognized a credit of  as compared to a credit of  in the fiscal year ended july  the decrease in the credit is primarily attributable to a significant reduction in the fiscal year ended july  of the number of stock options that are subject to variable accounting   non cash charge to consultants expense in the fiscal year ended july  for restricted shares of our common stock awarded to a consultant  and the remaining increase  net of individually offsetting items of lesser significance  is primarily attributable to higher payroll  recruiting and relocation expenses as a result of hiring additional employees 
primarily as a result of the factors described above  total costs and expenses for the fiscal year ended july  increased approximately  to approximately  from  for the fiscal year ended july  interest income decreased approximately  to  for the fiscal year ended july  from  for the fiscal year ended july  due to lower average cash and investment balances 
income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended july  was approximately  compared to approximately  for the fiscal year ended july  these benefits resulted from the sale of our new jersey net operating losses 
the resulting net loss for the fiscal year ended july  was  compared to a net loss of  for the fiscal year ended july  liquidity and capital resources from our inception  our principal sources of capital have been consulting revenues  private placements and public offerings of our securities  as well as loans and capital contributions from our principal stockholders 
we have had a history of recurring losses  giving rise to an accumulated deficit as of december  of  as compared to  as of july  we have had negative cash flow from operating activities of  for the five months ended december    for the fiscal year ended july    for the fiscal year ended july   and  for the fiscal year ended july  as of december   we had working capital of approximately  as compared to working capital of  as of july   representing a net increase in working capital of approximately  as explained further below  such increase is primarily attributable to a net increase in cash and short term investments 
in december  we closed a private placement of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock involving the sale of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
we received proceeds  net of offering costs  of  of which  was received in december and  million in january net cash used in operating activities was approximately  for the five months ended december   as compared to  for the five months ended december  the  decrease in net cash used in operating activities in the five months ended december  compared with is due to the following  decrease in net loss in the five months ended december  primarily due to an increase in revenues and an increase in income tax benefit  partially offset by higher research and development expenses   decrease in inventory in the five months ended december  primarily related to the establishment of reserve for certain raw materials and process validation batches for nitromist  and  decrease in accounts payable in the five months ended december  primarily due to the payment of invoices included in accounts payable at july  related to the manufacturing and process development of nitromist 
in the five months ended december  and   and  respectively  was provided by investing activities  principally due to maturities of short term investments  net of purchases of short term investments 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately  in the five months ended december   as compared to in the five months ended december  this increase is primarily due to  in net proceeds received in december relating to our december private placement 
until and unless our operations generate significant revenues and cash flow  we will attempt to continue to fund operations from cash on hand and through the sources of capital described below 
our long term liquidity is contingent upon achieving sales and positive cash flows from operating activities  and or obtaining additional financing 
the most likely sources of financing include private placements of our equity or debt securities or bridge loans to us from third party lenders  license payments from existing  current and future partners  and royalty payments from sales of approved drugs by partners 
we can give no assurances that any additional capital that we are able to obtain will be sufficient to meet our needs 
on december   we completed a private placement of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock in which we received gross proceeds of million and approximate net proceeds of million  of which million was received in december and million was received in january given the current and desired pace of development of our product candidates  we estimate that we will have sufficient cash on hand to fund development of our product candidates through december  we may  however  choose to raise additional capital before december  to fund future development activities or to take advantage of other strategic opportunities 
this could include the securing of funds through new strategic partnerships and or the sale of our common stock or other securities 
there can be no assurance that such capital will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
there are a number of risks and uncertainties related to our attempt to complete a financing or strategic partnering arrangement that are outside our control 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we are unsuccessful at obtaining additional financing as needed  we may be required to significantly curtail or cease operations 
we will need additional financing thereafter until we achieve profitability  if ever 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources
