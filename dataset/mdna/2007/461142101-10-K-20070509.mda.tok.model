item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information on sales by product line and geographic area and concentration of revenue 
backlog our solutions backlog at february   and  which does not include the contracted value of future maintenance and hosted solutions to be recognized  was approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
our service and support contracts range in original duration from one month to five years  with most hosted solutions contracts having initial terms of two to three years and most maintenance and related contracts having initial terms of one year 
because many of the longer duration contracts give customers early cancellation privileges  we do not consider our book of services contracts to be reportable backlog  as a portion of the potential revenue reflected in the contract values may never be realized 
at february   a portion of our backlog related to long term projects and cash basis customers 
we generally expect all projects in our existing backlog to be initiated within fiscal and most of such backlog to be recognized as revenue during fiscal approximately to of such backlog could revenue subsequent to fiscal some of our sales are completed in the same fiscal quarter as ordered 
thus  our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of actual sales for any future period 
research and development research and development expenses were approximately million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively  and included the design of new products and the enhancement of existing products 
our research and development spending is focused in six key areas 
first  we are developing software tools to aid in the development and deployment of customer applications incorporating speech recognition  text to speech  and other rich media technologies for enterprises and wireless and wireline providers 
next  we are developing server based application software platforms for operations and management of contact center  speech and call completion applications 
these software platforms are branded under the name media exchange 
we will use these software platforms for deployment and management of enterprise  wireless and wireline network operator applications  which are designed to operate in both jee and microsoft s 
net enterprise computing environments 
third  we are developing media servers  voice browsers  and call processing infrastructure based on open standards such as voicexml  ccxml and salt 
these media servers are voip enabled  allowing operation in soft switch and hybrid pstn and voip networks 
fourth  we are developing packaged  speech enabled applications for the network operator and enterprise markets 
these include a range of vertical and horizontal applications that are designed to greatly enhance customer return on investment by providing many commonly used configurable functions that can be deployed more quickly than custom applications 
fifth  we are developing software and tools designed to provide integration of live agent positions in a customer contact center setting 
this software covers a broad range of functions including agent call screen transfer  workflow management  full call recording  agent and supervisor management systems and reporting and various integration functions 
finally  we are developing modular productivity and communications applications for wireless and wireline applications including speech driven voice mail  voice activated dialing  and enhanced personal information management 
the network products are also branded under the product name media exchange 
we expect to maintain a strong commitment to research and development so that we can remain at the forefront of technology development in our markets 
proprietary rights we believe our existing patent  copyright  license and other proprietary rights in our products and technologies are material to the conduct of our business 
to protect these proprietary rights  we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret  copyright and other proprietary rights laws  nondisclosure safeguards and license 
table of contents agreements 
as of february   we owned patents and had pending applications for patents in the united states 
in addition  we have registered intervoice as a trademark in the united states  which is part of our portfolio of registered trademarks and service marks 
some of our patents and marks are also registered in certain foreign countries 
our software and other products are generally licensed to a customer under the terms of a nontransferable license agreement that restricts the use of the software and other products to the customer s internal purposes 
although our license agreements prohibit a customer from disclosing proprietary information contained in our products to any other person  it is technologically possible for our competitors to copy aspects of our products in violation of our rights 
furthermore  even in cases where we hold patents  the detection and policing of the unauthorized use of the patented technology is difficult 
moreover  judicial enforcement of copyrights may be uncertain  particularly in foreign countries 
the unauthorized use of our proprietary information by our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we generally provide our customers a qualified indemnity against the infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
from time to time  various owners of patents and copyrighted works send us or our customers letters alleging that our products do or might infringe upon the owner s intellectual property rights  and or suggesting that we or our customers should negotiate a license or cross license agreement with the owner 
our policy is to never knowingly infringe upon any third party s intellectual property rights 
accordingly  we forward any such allegation or licensing request to our outside legal counsel for their review  analysis and  where appropriate  opinion 
we generally attempt to resolve any such matter by informing the owner of our position concerning non infringement or invalidity  and or  if appropriate  negotiating a license or cross license agreement 
even though we attempt to resolve these matters without litigation  it is always possible that the owner of a patent or copyrighted work will sue us 
other than the current litigation with a patent holder discussed in item legal proceedings  no such litigation is currently pending against us 
as noted above  we currently have a portfolio of united states patents  and we have applied for and will continue to apply for and receive a number of additional patents to protect our technological innovations 
we believe our patent portfolio could allow us to assert counterclaims for infringement against certain owners of intellectual property rights if those owners were to sue us for infringement 
in certain situations  it might be beneficial for us to cross license certain of our patents for other patents which are relevant to the call automation industry 
see item legal proceedings for a discussion of certain patent matters 
see risk factors in item a for a discussion of risks associated with claims of intellectual property infringement 
manufacturing and facilities our manufacturing operations consist primarily of the final assembly  integration and extensive testing of subassemblies  host computer platforms  operating software and our run time software 
we currently use third parties to perform printed circuit board assembly  sheet metal fabrication and customer site service and repair 
although we generally use standard parts and components for our products  some of our components  including semi conductors and  in particular  digital signal processors manufactured by texas instruments  are available only from a small number of vendors 
likewise  we license speech recognition technology from a small number of vendors 
as we continue to migrate to open  standards based systems  we will become increasingly dependent on our component suppliers and software vendors 
to date  we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of needed components and licenses in a timely manner  and we expect to continue to be able to do so 
nevertheless  if our significant vendors are unable to supply components or licenses at current levels  we may not be able to obtain these items from another source or at historical prices 
in such situations  we would be unable to provide products and services to our customers or generate historical operating margins  and our business and operating results would suffer

risk factors this report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this form k  including  without limitation  statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes to consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report regarding our financial position  our business strategy  plans and objectives of management for future operations  future sales and industry conditions  are forward looking statements 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
in addition to important factors described elsewhere in this report  we caution current and potential investors that the following important risk factors  among others  sometimes have affected  and in the future could affect  our actual results and could cause such results during fiscal  and beyond  to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of intervoice 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period  and this may cause our stock price to decline 
our revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect further fluctuations in the future 
given these fluctuations  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results are not necessarily meaningful or an accurate indicator of our future performance 
as a result  our results of operations may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in the future  which could cause our stock price to decline 
factors that contribute to fluctuations in our operating results and can preclude our ability to accurately forecast our results include the following variability in the time periods necessary to complete projects and achieve project milestones in order to recognize revenue  which may be influenced by volume  size  timing  contractual terms of new licenses and renewals of existing licenses and cash basis revenues  the components of our revenue that are deferred  including our subscription based hosted solutions and that portion of our software licenses attributable to support and maintenance  volume  timing and fulfillment of customer orders  particularly with respect to large orders sales of approximately million or more  some of which are completed in the same quarter in which they are ordered and some of which are completed over several quarters  and fluctuations in demand for our products and services  our ability to complete orders from our solutions backlog  subject to timing changes requested by our customers  and projects accounted for on a percentage of completion basis  including estimates based on a variety of factors and subject to revision  the use of low pricing to win important customers  and the possible recognition of loss contingencies for certain projects that we estimate will be delivered at a negative gross margin  the lengthy sales cycle for our products  which typically involve comprehensive solutions that may require detailed customer evaluations  the performance of our international business  which accounts for a significant portion of our consolidated revenues  and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the mix of products we sell and services we offer and whether our products are sold through our direct sales force or through an intermediary  introduction of new products  product upgrades or updates by us or our competitors  and any resulting customer delays in purchasing products  any increased price sensitivity by our customers  particularly due to increased competition including open source or free software  
table of contents periodic difficult economic conditions  particularly affecting the technology industry  as well as economic uncertainties  higher than anticipated costs related to fixed price contracts with our customers  our ability to effectively manage our operating expense levels  timing of significant marketing and sales promotions  and expenses incurred pursuing new product or market opportunities  stock based compensation expense  which we began recognizing for our stock based compensation plans in the first quarter of fiscal  costs and charges related to certain events  including sarbanes oxley compliance efforts  matters relating to our audit committee investigation and litigation  the structure  timing and integration of acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies and related disruption of our current business  factors that lead to substantial declines in estimated values of long lived assets below their carrying value  and changes in generally accepted accounting principles 
due to these and other factors  our revenue and operating results are difficult to forecast and are prone to fluctuate  which may cause a decline in our stock price 
our expense levels are based in significant part on our expectations of future revenue  and we may not be able to reduce our expenses quickly to respond to a shortfall in projected revenue 
therefore  our failure to meet revenue expectations could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
see the discussion entitled sales in item of part ii for a discussion of our system for estimating sales and tracking sales trends in our business 
we are subject to potential and pending lawsuits and other claims 
we are subject to certain potential and pending lawsuits and other claims discussed in item legal proceedings of part i of this annual report on form k 
furthermore  we may become subject to claims  including claims by the government  or other adverse consequences arising from the findings of the audit committee investigation and related sec investigation discussed in item we and certain of our current and former officers and non officer employees are currently responding to or have responded to sec subpoenas to produce documents and provide testimony about the transactions that were the subject of the investigation 
any adverse judgment  penalty or settlement related to any lawsuit or other such claim could have consequences that would be material to our financial position or results of operations 
we may be required to indemnify certain of our current and former directors and officers under existing arrangements in connection with the defense  or advancement of defense related expenses  we are currently providing to certain individuals in connection with the class action lawsuit and the sec investigation 
our insurance policies provide coverage for losses and expenses incurred by us and our current and former directors and officers in connection with claims made under the federal securities laws 
these policies  however  exclude losses and expenses related to the barrie class action lawsuit discussed in item or to other litigation based on claims that are substantially the same as the claims in the barrie class action and contain other customary provisions to limit or exclude coverage for certain losses and expenses 
we face intense competition based on product capabilities and we experience ever increasing demands from our actual and prospective customers for our products to be compatible with a variety of rapidly proliferating computing  telephony and computer networking technologies and standards 
our success is dependent  to a large degree  on our effectiveness in allocating resources to developing and improving products compatible with those technologies  standards and functionalities that ultimately become widely accepted by our current and prospective customers 
our success is also dependent  to a large degree  on our ability to implement arrangements with vendors of complementary product offerings so that we can provide our current and prospective customers greater functionality 
our principal competitors include avaya  nortel  nuance communications  comverse technology  unisys and alcatel lucent 
many of our 
table of contents competitors have greater financial  technological and marketing resources than we have  as well as greater name recognition 
although we have committed substantial resources to enhance our existing products and to develop and market new products  there is no assurance we will be successful 
in addition  it is possible that new entrants to the market and strategic acquisitions and partnerships between existing companies could increase the competition in the markets in which we participate 
an increase in such competition could materially adversely affect our ability to sell our products  thereby adversely affecting our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may not be successful in selling and implementing our products and services in the face of the new  standards based market 
intervoice has historically provided complete  bundled hardware and software solutions using internally developed components to address our customers total business needs 
the markets for our products have required a shift to the development of products and services based on an open  standards based architecture such as the jee and microsoft s 
net environments utilizing voicexml and or salt standards 
such an open  standards based approach allows customers to independently purchase and combine hardware components  standardized software modules  and customization  installation and integration services from individual vendors deemed to offer the best value in the particular class of product or service 
in such an environment  we believe we may sell less hardware and fewer bundled systems and may become increasingly dependent on our development and sale of software application packages  customized software and consulting and integration services 
this shift places new challenges on us to hire and retain the mix of personnel necessary to respond to this business environment  to adapt to the changing expense structure that the new environment may tend to foster  to respond to potentially different competitors  and to increase sales of services  customized software and application packages to offset reduced sales of hardware and bundled solutions 
failure to develop  enhance  acquire and introduce new products and services to respond to continually changing market conditions or customer requirements  or lack of customer acceptance of our products or services will materially adversely affect the value of our intellectual property  barriers to entry to our business  customer retention  gross margins  and the results of operations and financial condition 
we may not be able to retain our customer base  and  in particular  our more significant customers 
our success is heavily dependent on our ability to retain our significant customers 
the loss of one of our significant customers could negatively impact our operating results 
our installed base of customers generally is not contractually obligated to place further solutions orders with us or to extend their services contracts with us at the expiration of their current contracts 
we will be harmed if we lose key business and technical personnel 
we rely upon the services of a relatively small number of key technical  project management and senior management personnel  most of whom do not have employment contracts 
if we were to lose any of our key personnel  replacing them could be difficult and costly 
if we were unable to successfully and promptly replace such personnel  our business could be materially harmed 
our reliance on significant vendor relationships could result in significant expense or an inability to serve our customers if we lose these relationships 
although we generally use standard parts and components in our products  some of our hardware components are available only from a small number of vendors 
likewise  we license speech recognition technology primarily from nuance communications  inc  the dominant vendor for this technology 
as we continue to migrate to open  standards based systems  we will become increasingly dependent on our component suppliers and software vendors 
to date  we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of needed components and licenses in a timely manner  and we expect to continue to be able to do so 
nevertheless  if our significant vendors are unable to supply components or licenses at current levels  we may not be able to obtain these items from another source or at historical prices 
in such instances  we would be unable to provide products and services to our customers or generate historical operating margins  and our business and operating results would suffer 
if third parties assert claims that our products or services infringe on their technology and related intellectual property rights  whether the claims are made directly against us or against our customers  we could incur substantial costs 
we believe software and technology companies  including us and others 
table of contents in our industry  increasingly may become subject to infringement claims 
such claims may require us to enter into costly license agreements or result in even more costly litigation 
to the extent a licensing arrangement is required  the arrangement may not be available at all  or  if available  may be very expensive or even prohibitively expensive 
as with any legal proceeding  there is no guarantee we will prevail in any litigation instituted against us asserting infringement of intellectual property rights 
to the extent we suffer an adverse judgment  we might have to pay substantial damages  discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  repurchase infringing products from our customers in accordance with indemnity obligations  expend significant resources to acquire non infringing alternatives  and or obtain licenses to the intellectual property that has been infringed upon 
as with licensing arrangements  non infringing substitute technologies may not be available and  if available  may be very expensive  or even prohibitively expensive  to implement 
accordingly  for all of the foregoing reasons  a claim of infringement could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to risks related to our international operations that could increase our costs and hurt our business 
our products are currently sold in more than countries 
our international sales were and of total sales for the fiscal years ended february  and  respectively 
international sales  personnel and property are subject to certain risks  including terrorism  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  ability to collect on accounts receivable  the difficulty and expense of maintaining foreign offices and distribution channels  tariffs and other barriers to trade  greater difficulty in protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights  general economic and political conditions in each country  including nationalization of customers or channel partners  loss of revenue  property and equipment from expropriation  import and export licensing requirements  and additional expenses and risks inherent in conducting operations in geographically distant locations  including risks arising from differences in language and cultural approaches to the conduct of business 
our inability to meet contracted performance targets could subject us to significant penalties 
many of our contracts  particularly for hosted solutions  foreign contracts and contracts with telecommunication companies  include provisions for the assessment of damages for delayed project completion and or for our failure to achieve certain minimum service levels 
we have had to pay damages in the past and may have to pay additional damages in the future 
any such future damages could be significant 
increasing consolidation in the telecommunications and financial industries could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
the majority of our largest customers are in the telecommunications and financial industries 
these industries are undergoing significant consolidation as a result of merger and acquisition activity 
this activity could result in a decrease in the number of customers purchasing our products and or in delayed purchases of our products by customers that are reviewing their strategic alternatives in light of a pending merger or acquisition 
if these results occur  our revenues and profitability could decline or our loss could increase 
our products are complex  and software defects could reduce our revenues and expose us to litigation 
the software products we offer are complex and may contain errors or defects  even after extensive testing and quality control  particularly in early versions 
furthermore  because our products increasingly are designed around an open standards based architecture incorporating elements developed by third parties  such errors or defects may be outside of our direct ability to control or correct 
any defects or errors could potentially result in loss of revenues  product returns or order cancellations  and could potentially hinder market 
table of contents acceptance of our products and harm our reputation 
accordingly  any defects or errors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our customer license agreements typically contain provisions to limit our product warranty obligations and exposure to potential liability claims 
we have grown  and may continue to grow  through acquisitions  which could dilute our existing shareholders and could involve substantial acquisition risks 
as part of our business strategy  we have in the past acquired  and expect to continue to acquire or make investments in  other businesses and technologies 
we may issue equity securities for future acquisitions  which would dilute our existing stockholders  and we may incur debt in connection with future acquisitions  which may include covenants or other restrictions that hinder our ability to operate our business 
furthermore  our prior acquisitions required substantial integration and management efforts 
acquisitions can involve a number of risks  including difficulty in transitioning and integrating the operations  facilities and personnel of the acquired businesses  including different and complex order processing  support and accounting and financial reporting systems  loss of key management  sales  research and development and other key employees of the acquired company  difficulty in integrating acquired products into our product portfolio  including engineering  sales and marketing integration  impairment of relationships with partners  suppliers and customers  difficulty in implementing and standardizing company wide financial  accounting  billing  information and other systems and the internal controls surrounding those systems and processes  disruption of our ongoing operations and distraction of management and other employees  difficulty in incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and technology  unanticipated expenses and delays in completing acquired development projects and technology integration  difficulty in management of geographically remote operations in the united states and internationally  delay of sales to customers pending resolution of product integration between our existing and our newly acquired products  and difficulty entering new markets or businesses in which we have limited experience 
as a result of these and other risks  we may not realize anticipated benefits from our acquisitions 
any failure to achieve these benefits or failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies could result in a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our stock price has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations 
our stock price historically has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future 
various factors contribute to the volatility of our stock price  including business developments such as new product introductions and acquisitions or dispositions  litigation developments  quarterly variations in our financial results  our ability to meet investors expectations  and general economic and market conditions 
in addition  third party announcements by our partners and competitors may contribute to our stock price volatility 
certain types of investors may choose not to invest in stocks with this level of stock price volatility 
fluctuations in our stock price could cause increased risk of shareholder litigation  which could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
we are exposed to risks related to our channel program that could decrease our revenues and hurt our business 
although we principally sell our products and services through our direct sales force  a significant amount of our sales are made through intermediaries such as distributors  system integrators and other strategic channel partners 
we expect the percentage of sales through intermediaries to increase as 
table of contents we continue to focus our sales efforts through the channel and other partners 
we anticipate future revenue growth to depend in large part on our success in expanding relationships  and establishing new relationships  with intermediaries 
these intermediaries may sell their own products or other vendors products that compete with our products  and may compete with our own direct sales force in certain sales opportunities 
while we have instituted programs designed to increase sales of our products through intermediaries  certain intermediaries may give greater priority to products of other suppliers  including competitors 
our ability to grow sales through intermediaries depends on our investment in appropriate financial incentives  support and sales tools for intermediaries  while effectively alleviating conflict with our own sales force 
failure to effect this strategy appropriately may result in certain intermediaries choosing to cease or reduce the sales of our products  resulting in a material adverse change in our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we implemented a new company wide erp system during the third quarter of fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  we completed the implementation of a new  company wide erp system 
our new system affects all facets of our business  including our ability to quote  receive and process orders  track inventory and work in process  ship and bill completed orders  process and apply cash receipts from our customers and summarize and report the results of our operations 
if we encounter problems in the operation of our new system  our ability to conduct our daily operations in an efficient  effective and properly controlled manner could be compromised  and our operating results could suffer 
in addition  any such operational problems could cause us to expend significant time and other resources in an effort to resolve such problems  and this diversion of management and staff time could further adversely affect our ability to serve our customers and sustain our normal operations 
unanticipated changes in our effective tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability or increase our loss 
we are a us based multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions 
we are generally required to account for taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate  including making assumptions  interpretations and judgments with respect to the applicable tax requirements 
our provision for income taxes is calculated based on a mix of earnings  statutory rates  and enacted tax rules by jurisdiction  including transfer pricing 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis 
it is possible that these positions may be challenged which may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate  which could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition  and our stock price 
a failure to maintain adequate internal control procedures as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of may preclude our management s ability to conclude that we have effective internal controls over our financial reporting 
these internal controls are also required for us to produce management financial information  make determinations on revenue recognition and other material accounting issues  and prevent financial fraud 
if we are unable to produce reliable financial reports  make appropriate determinations on revenue recognition and material accounting policies or prevent fraud  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we have sustained operating losses in the past  and may incur additional losses in the future which may require us to raise additional capital on unfavorable terms 
we cannot be certain that our revenue will grow or that we will achieve or maintain profitable operations in the future 
if we are unable to return to and maintain profitability  the market price for our stock may decline  perhaps substantially 
if we continue to have operating losses  we may be required to raise additional capital to maintain or grow our operations 
such additional capital may only be available at unfavorable terms that could be dilutive to existing shareholders  have a high interest rate  contain restrictive covenants  or contain other unfavorable terms

katz technology licensing lp raktl has sent letters to certain of our customers suggesting that the customer should negotiate a license agreement to cover the practice of certain patents owned by raktl 
in the letters  raktl has alleged that certain of its patents pertain to certain enhanced services offered by network providers  including prepaid card and wireless services and postpaid card services 
raktl has further alleged that certain of its patents pertain to certain call processing applications  including applications for call centers that route calls using a called party s dnis identification number 
as a result of the correspondence  many of intervoice s customers have had discussions  or are in discussions  with raktl 
we offer certain products that can be programmed and configured to provide enhanced services to network providers and call processing applications for call centers 
our contracts with customers usually include a qualified obligation to indemnify and defend customers against claims that products as delivered by intervoice infringe a third party s patent 
none of our customers has notified us that raktl has claimed that any specific product provided by us infringes any claims of any raktl patent 
accordingly  we have not been required to defend any customers against a claim of infringement under a raktl patent 
we have  however  received letters from customers notifying us of the efforts by raktl to license its patent portfolio and reminding us of our potential obligations under the indemnification provisions of our agreements in the event that a claim is asserted 
some of our customers have licensed certain rights under the raktl patent portfolio 
two such customers who had previously attempted to tender the defense of their products to us informed us that they had entered into agreements to license certain rights under the raktl patents and demanded we indemnify them for unspecified amounts  including attorney s fees  paid in connection with the license agreements 
we notified these customers that we believe we do not have any indemnity obligation in connection with the license agreements 
we have received no further response from either customer 
a number of customers  including customers of ours and edify corporation s edify have been sued as defendants in several lawsuits brought by raktl in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas and the united states district court for the district of delaware 
several of these defendants who are also customers have notified us or edify of the lawsuits pursuant to the indemnity paragraphs of their respective sales agreements and have indicated to us that the lawsuits could potentially impact the defense and indemnity paragraphs of their respective sales agreements 
neither we nor edify believe that we have a current obligation to defend or indemnify these customers in connection with the current allegations made in the raktl lawsuits and when contacted we have requested that the customers provide additional information concerning the assertions made by raktl 
in response to the correspondence from  and litigation initiated by  raktl a few of our customers and customers of edify have attempted to tender to us the defense of our products under contractual indemnity provisions 
we have informed these customers that  while we fully intend to honor any contractual indemnity provisions  we do not believe we currently have any obligation to provide such a defense because raktl does not appear to have made a claim  either in the correspondence or litigation  that any intervoice product infringes a raktl patent 
some of these customers have disagreed with us and stated that they believe that the statements and 
table of contents allegations contained within correspondence and or litigation pleadings filed by raktl can be construed as a claim against intervoice products 
even though no claims have been made by raktl that a specific product offered by intervoice infringes any claim under the raktl patent portfolio  we have received opinions from our outside patent counsel that certain products and applications we offer do not infringe certain claims of the raktl patents 
we have also received opinions from our outside counsel that certain claims under the raktl patent portfolio are invalid or unenforceable 
furthermore  based on the reviews by outside counsel  we are not aware of any valid and enforceable claims under the raktl portfolio that are infringed by our products 
if we do become involved in litigation in connection with the raktl patent portfolio  under a contractual indemnity or any other legal theory  we intend to vigorously contest the claims and to assert appropriate defenses

cv d  pending in the united states district court  northern district of texas  dallas division several related class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the northern district of texas on behalf of purchasers of common stock of intervoice during the period from october  through june  the class period 
plaintiffs have filed claims  which were consolidated into one proceeding  under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of and securities and exchange commission rule b against us as well as certain named current and former officers and directors of intervoice on behalf of the alleged class members 
in the complaint  plaintiffs claim that we and the named current and former officers and directors issued false and misleading statements during the class period concerning the financial condition of intervoice  the results of the merger with brite voice systems  inc brite and the alleged future business projections of intervoice 
plaintiffs have asserted that these alleged statements resulted in artificially inflated stock prices 
the district court dismissed the plaintiffs complaint because it lacked the degree of specificity and factual support to meet the pleading standards applicable to federal securities litigation 
the plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit  which affirmed the dismissal in part and reversed in part 
the fifth circuit remanded a limited number of issues for further proceedings in the district court

audit committee investigation during fiscal  our audit committee conducted an investigation of certain transactions that occurred during our fiscal years through the audit committee was assisted in its investigation by separate independent legal counsel and a national accounting firm 
the audit committee reported the results of its investigation to the sec  and we are cooperating with the sec in its own investigation regarding the transactions 
we have provided documents to the sec in response to a subpoena and informal requests for information about the transactions  and several of our current and former officers and non officer employees have provided testimony to the sec 
our audit committee and its counsel are continuing to monitor our response to the sec  and they also have conducted a review of certain documents provided to the sec which we located after the audit committee s original investigation 
intervoice is presently in discussions with the sec about a possible settlement of the matters covered by the audit committee investigation  but there is no assurance that agreement on any settlement will be reached 
we have recorded approximately million of expense based on the current status of such settlement discussions 
intervoice is also honoring our obligation to indemnify  to the extent appropriate  certain current and former officers and other employees of intervoice  including our chief executive officer  who received subpoenas to produce documents and provide testimony to the sec in connection with the investigation 
furthermore  we are honoring our obligation to reimburse legal fees incurred by certain recipients of the subpoenas 
the audit committee investigation found that we accounted for certain transactions incorrectly during our fiscal years through the audit committee investigation concluded that a million payment made by intervoice to a publicly held supplier purportedly for certain prepaid licenses was linked to an agreement to amend a warrant issued to us by the supplier to permit our cashless exercise of the warrant 
as a result  we believe the million payment should have been recorded as a reduction in the million gain we recognized on the sale of the shares underlying the warrant during the fourth quarter of fiscal and should not have been recorded as prepaid license inventory 
our payment to the supplier may have rendered unavailable a nonexclusive registration exemption for the sale of the shares underlying the warrant 
the audit committee investigation also found that we intentionally provided the same supplier false or misleading documents for such supplier to use to support such supplier s improper recognition of revenue in calendar the audit committee investigation and review further found that six of the seven customer sales transactions the committee investigated were accounted for incorrectly and that there was intentional misconduct in at least one of those sales transactions 
these six transactions occurred at the end of quarters in which we just met analysts expectations with respect to earnings per share 
the audit committee found that we improperly recognized revenue in a quarter end barter transaction involving approximately of annual revenues for fiscal  and that we improperly accelerated the recognition of revenue in five quarter end transactions totaling approximately and of annual revenues in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we  and certain of our current and former officers and the sec have agreed that intervoice and the officers will not assert any defenses based on a statute of limitations with respect to any action or proceeding against intervoice or such officers brought  by or on behalf of the sec arising out of the sec investigation for the time periods set forth in the agreements 
as a result of work performed in responding to the sec subpoena  the audit committee has concluded that intervoice also improperly recognized approximately million of revenue in two sales transactions during the second and third quarters of fiscal because the transactions were subject to oral side agreements that gave our customer expanded rights of return 
we subsequently reversed the million of revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with a return of the related systems 
we also provided documents to the sec concerning these two additional sales 
table of contents transactions pursuant to a separate subpoena 
separately  the audit committee determined that in september one of our current executive officers improperly communicated intervoice information to a shareholder 
intervoice s management has concluded  with the concurrence of the audit committee and our external auditors  that restatement of our prior period financial statements to adjust for the findings of the audit committee investigation and review is not necessary 
in reaching this conclusion  we considered the impact of the incorrect accounting on each of the periods affected  the ages of the affected financial statements and the lack of any material changes in prior period trends as a result of the incorrect accounting 
in addition  we noted that since the date of the most recent transaction reviewed in the investigation  we have restructured our business  made significant management changes  consolidated our physical operations  significantly reduced our fixed operating costs and refinanced and repaid all of our major debt obligations 
we cannot predict whether we may have future losses relating to the matters investigated by the audit committee as a result of future claims  if any  including any claims by the government

during fiscal  we incurred approximately million in charges in connection with restructuring expenses for severance and organizational changes affecting approximately persons made at the time of the acquisition of edify 
in addition  during fiscal  our income tax provision included benefits totaling million resulting from the reversal of valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets and from the resolution of tax contingencies  partially offset by a charge of million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings 
the fiscal loss from operations was impacted by special charges of million related to staffing reductions  facilities closures  the write down of excess inventories  costs associated with loss contracts  loss on early extinguishment of debt  and impairment of certain intangible assets

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we use estimates and projections that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures and that may vary from actual results 
we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
revenue recognition intervoice recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware and software solutions  from the delivery of recurring maintenance and other software support associated with installed solutions and from the provision of our enterprise and network solutions on a managed service basis 
our policies for revenue recognition follow the guidance in statement of position no 
software revenue recognition  as amended sop  sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab and eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
if contracts include multiple elements  each element of the arrangement is separately identified and accounted for based on the relative fair value of such element as evidenced by vendor specific objective evidence 
in situations where vendor specific objective evidence exists for all undelivered elements  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements  the residual method is used 
in these cases  the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered items is deferred and the residual is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
revenue is not recognized on any element of the arrangement if undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements 
sale of hardware and software solutions many of our sales are of customized software or customized hardware software solutions 
such solutions incorporate newly designed software and or standard building blocks of hardware and software which have been significantly modified  configured and assembled to match unique customer requirements defined at the beginning of each project 
we account for sales of these customized solutions using contract accounting principles  following the relevant guidance in statement of position no 
accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  under either the percentage of completion poc or completed contract methodology  as further described below 
in other instances  particularly in situations where we sell to distributors or where we are supplying only additional product capacity ie  similar hardware and software solutions to what is already in place for an existing customer  we may sell solutions that do not require significant customization 
in those situations  we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  our fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
typically  this is at shipment when there is no installation obligation or at the completion of minor post shipment installation obligations 
generally  we use poc accounting for our more complex custom solutions 
in determining whether a particular sale qualifies for poc treatment  we consider multiple factors including the value of the contract and the degree of customization inherent in the project 
projects normally must have an aggregate value of more than  to qualify for poc treatment 
for a project accounted for under the poc method  we recognize revenue as work progresses over the life of the project based on a comparison of actual labor hours worked to current estimates of total labor hours required to complete the project 
we review and update project estimates on a quarterly basis 
the terms of most poc projects require customers to make interim progress payments during the course of the project 
these payments and a written customer acknowledgement at the completion of the project  usually following a final customer test phase  document the customer s acceptance of the project 
in some circumstances  the passage of a contractually defined time period or the customer s use of the solution in a live operating environment may also constitute final acceptance of a project 
we use completed contract accounting for smaller custom projects not meeting the poc thresholds described above 
we also use completed contract accounting in situations where the technical requirements of a project are so complex or are so dependent on the development of new technologies or the unique application of existing 
table of contents technologies that our ability to make reasonable estimates is in doubt or in situations where a sale is subject to unusual inherent hazards 
such hazards are unrelated to  or only incidentally related to  our typical activities and include situations where the enforceability of a contract is suspect  completion of the contract is subject to pending litigation  or where the solutions produced are subject to condemnation or expropriation risks 
these latter situations are extremely rare 
for all completed contract sales  we recognize revenue upon customer acceptance as evidenced by a written customer acknowledgement  the passage of a contractually defined time period or the customer s use of the solution in a live operating environment 
we generate a significant percentage of our sales  particularly sales of network solutions  outside the united states 
customers in certain countries are subject to significant economic and political challenges that affect their cash flow  and many customers outside the united states are generally accustomed to vendor financing in the form of extended payment terms 
to remain competitive in markets outside the united states  we may offer selected customers such payment terms 
in all cases  however  we only recognize revenue at such time as our solutions or service fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
in some limited cases  this policy causes us to recognize revenue on a cash basis  limiting revenue recognition on certain sales of solutions and or services to the actual cash received to date from the customer  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
sale of maintenance and software support we recognize revenue from maintenance and software support when the services are performed or ratably over the related contract period 
all significant costs and expenses associated with maintenance contracts are expensed as incurred 
this approximates a ratable recognition of expenses over the contract period 
sale of hosted solutions we provide enhanced communications solutions to some customers on an outsourced basis through our hosted solutions business 
while specific arrangements can vary  we generally build a customized solution to address a specific customer s business needs and then own  monitor  and maintain that system  ensuring that it processes the customer s business transactions in accordance with defined specifications 
for our services  we generally receive a one time setup fee paid at the beginning of the contract and a service fee paid monthly over the life of the contract 
most contracts range from to months in length 
we combine the setup fee and the total service fee to be received from the customer and recognize revenue ratably over the term of the hosted solutions contract 
we capitalize the cost of the computer system s and related applications used to provide the service and depreciate such costs over the contract life for assets unique to the individual contract or the life of the equipment for assets common to the general hosted solutions operations or for assets whose useful lives are shorter than the related contract term 
we expense all labor and other period costs required to provide the service as we incur them 
loss contracts we update our estimates of the costs necessary to complete all customer contracts in process on a quarterly basis 
whenever current estimates indicate that we will incur a loss on the completion of a contract  we immediately record a provision for such loss as part of the current period cost of goods sold 
stock based compensation we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payments  effective march  using the modified prospective transition method 
determining the amount and classification of expense for stock based compensation  as well as the associated impact to the balance sheets and statements of cash flows  requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock based compensation expenses using fair value models 
the most significant assumptions used in calculating the fair value include the expected volatility  expected lives and estimated forfeiture rates for employee stock option grants 
we use a weighted average of the implied volatility  the most recent one year volatility and the median historical volatility for the period of the expected life of the option to determine the expected volatility to be used in our fair value calculation  with the median historical volatility receiving the heaviest weighting of the three factors 
we believe that this is the best available estimate of expected volatility 
the expected lives of options are determined based on our historical stock option exercise experience 
we believe the historical experience method is the best estimate of future exercise patterns currently available 
estimated forfeiture rates are derived from historical 
table of contents forfeiture patterns 
we believe the historical experience method is the best estimate of forfeitures currently available 
changes to these assumptions or changes to our stock based compensation plans  including the number of awards granted  could impact our stock based compensation expense in future periods 
we update these assumptions annually or as circumstances arise which would indicate the need for them to be updated more often 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets intangible assets are comprised of separately identifiable intangible assets arising out of our fiscal acquisition of certain assets of nuasis  our fiscal acquisition of edify and our fiscal acquisition of brite  and certain capitalized purchased software 
we amortize intangible assets using the straight line method over each asset s estimated useful life 
such lives range from months to years 
we review our intangible assets for possible impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted projected cash flows associated with such assets are less than the carrying amounts of the assets 
in those situations  we recognize an impairment loss on the intangible asset equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the asset s fair value  generally based upon discounted estimates of future cash flows 
we expense the cost of internally developed software products and substantial enhancements to existing software products for sale until technological feasibility is established  after which point any additional costs are capitalized 
technological feasibility of a computer software product is established when we have completed all planning  designing  coding  and testing activities necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
no costs have been capitalized to date for internally developed software products and enhancements as our current process for developing software is essentially completed concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility 
we capitalize purchased software upon acquisition when such software is technologically feasible or if it has an alternative future use  such as use of the software in different products or resale of the purchased software 
goodwill goodwill is attributable to our fiscal acquisition of edify and our fiscal purchase of brite 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite life and is not subject to annual amortization 
we do  however  perform an impairment test on our goodwill balance on at least an annual basis and more frequently if we identify triggering events on an interim basis 
our impairment review follows the two step approach defined in sfas no 
the first step compares the fair value of intervoice with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  we compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the lesser of that excess or the carrying amount of goodwill 
income taxes we recognize deferred income taxes using the liability method and reflect the tax impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations 
we provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in circumstances where we do not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not 
this is a highly subjective assessment and requires us to evaluate the predictability of future taxable income while considering our operating history which includes significant losses in fiscal and in fiscal  we reversed a significant portion of the valuation allowances originally recorded in fiscal and associated with deferred tax assets of our us operations 
we believe our profitability in the us for fiscal and the previous three years and our projected future profitability make it more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of these previously reserved deferred tax assets 
we continue to provide valuation allowances on foreign and state deferred tax assets and on certain us federal deferred tax assets that will benefit equity if and when realized 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements 
fin requires companies to 
table of contents determine that it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recorded in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on the derecognition of tax benefits  measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties  along with any related interest and penalties 
fin will also require significant additional disclosures regarding uncertain tax positions 
fin is effective for years beginning after december  and we will be required to adopt the interpretation in the first quarter of fiscal on a prospective basis 
we continue to evaluate the impact fin will have on our financial position and results of operations 
results of operations the following table presents certain items as a percentage of sales for our last three fiscal years

as used in this report  solutions sales include the sale of hardware and or software applications and the related consulting services associated with designing  integrating  and installing custom applications to address customers business needs 
recurring services include a suite of maintenance and software upgrade offerings and the provision of customized solutions to customers on a hosted solution outsourced basis 
our solutions product line includes voice portal  messaging  and payment solutions 
our sales by product line for fiscal  and were as follows in millions change change from prior from prior year year voice portal solution sales messaging solution sales payment solution sales total solution sales maintenance and related services revenues hosted solutions revenues total recurring services revenues total sales 
table of contents we assign revenues to geographic locations based on the location of the customer

changes in foreign currency exchange rates from fiscal to served to decrease sales for fiscal by approximately million 
sales of voice portal solutions increased significantly in fiscal from fiscal all geographies except europe reflected increases in voice portal sales during this timeframe  with the largest increase reflected in north america 
this increase reflects the inclusion of sales to former edify customers for the full year of fiscal including approximately million recognized under an approximately million sale to a major us satellite television provider 
fiscal also included million of revenue from a cash basis customer based in the central and south american market as well as million from a follow on order for incremental capacity from the same customer which was recognized on an accrual basis based upon several years of successful cash collections activities associated with this customer 
given the delays we are experiencing in collection of this receivable  we will return to the cash basis of accounting for future transactions with this customer 
sales of voice portal solutions declined significantly in fiscal from fiscal levels 
a portion of the decline results from the fact that sales in fiscal included approximately million recognized under an million sale to a major us wireless provider 
there were no individual sales of this magnitude in fiscal the balance of the decline reflected weakness in our voice portal sales across all our major geographic markets  with the largest decline focused in north america 
we believe some voice portal customers postponed investment decisions during fiscal while they continued to evaluate the effects of the market shift to open standards on their individual processing environments 
fiscal included recognition of approximately million under the first two contracts for our new advanced messaging product 
sales of messaging solutions decreased in fiscal from fiscal the largest decreases were reflected in the middle east  africa and latin america where fiscal did not include any contracts of comparable size to the first two media exchange contracts recognized during fiscal one of these contracts was completed during the first quarter of fiscal and the second contract was completed during the first quarter of fiscal our sales of payment solutions in and primarily reflect sales of capacity upgrades to existing clients in the middle east and africa  latin america and the pacific rim 
the decline in such sales from fiscal to fiscal is largely attributable to the loss of an mea customer who had purchased million in payment solutions during fiscal the increase in maintenance and related service revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal is comprised of increases of million in maintenance revenues on voice portal solutions offset  in part  by decreases of million in maintenance revenues on messaging and payment solutions 
this increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of edify 
the increase in our maintenance and related services revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal is comprised of increases of million in maintenance revenues on voice portal solutions offset  in part  by decreases of million in maintenance revenues on messaging and payment solutions 

table of contents the decrease in hosted solutions revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal is comprised of growth of million in revenues from our north american enterprise customers offset by reductions of million from our international network customers 
we recognized revenues totaling million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal under one long term international hosted solutions contract with a uk based network operator 
this contract expired in july international hosted solutions revenues during fiscal included million relating to services performed for an international hosted solutions customer for which we recognize revenue on a cash basis 
we recognized million and million of similar sales to the same customer in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in hosted solutions revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal is comprised of growth of million in revenues from our north american enterprise customers offset  in part  by net reductions of million in revenues from our international network customers 
no customer accounted for of our total sales during fiscal we have historically made significant sales of solutions  maintenance and hosted solutions  including the hosted solutions described above  to o such combined sales accounted for of our total sales during fiscal and no other customer accounted for or more of our sales during such periods 
we are prone to quarterly sales fluctuations 
some of our transactions are completed in the same fiscal quarter as ordered 
the quantity and size of large sales sales valued at approximately million or more during any quarter can cause wide variations in our quarterly sales and earnings  as such sales are unevenly distributed throughout the fiscal year 
we use a system combining estimated sales from our recurring services contracts  pipeline of solution sales opportunities  and backlog of committed solution orders to estimate sales and trends in our business 
for the years ended february   february  and february  sales were sourced as follows year ended february based on averages of quarterly activity sales from recurring service and support contracts  including contracts for hosted solutions sales from solutions backlog sales from the pipeline our service and support contracts range in original duration from one month to five years  with most hosted solutions contracts having initial terms of two to three years and most maintenance and related contracts having initial terms of one year 
because many of the longer duration contracts give customers early cancellation privileges  we do not consider our book of services contracts to be reportable backlog  as a portion of the potential revenue reflected in the contract values may never be realized 
nevertheless  it is easier for us to estimate service and support sales than to estimate solution sales for future quarters because the service and support contracts generally span multiple quarters and revenues recognized under each contract are generally similar from one quarter to the next 
our backlog is made up of customer orders for solutions for which we have received complete purchase orders 
at february   and  our backlog of solutions sales was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we generally expect all projects in our existing backlog to be initiated within fiscal and most of such backlog to be recognized as revenue during fiscal approximately to of such backlog could revenue subsequent to fiscal our ability to estimate the amount of backlog that will be converted to revenue in any fiscal quarter can be affected by factors outside our control  including changes in project timing requested by our customers and cash collections from certain international customers 
our pipeline of opportunities for solutions sales is the aggregation of our sales opportunities for which we have not received a purchase order  with each opportunity evaluated for the date the potential customer will make a purchase decision  competitive risks  and the potential amount of any resulting sale 
no matter how promising a pipeline opportunity may appear  there is no assurance it will ever result in a sale 
accordingly  upward or 
table of contents downward trends in our total pipeline are not considered meaningful from a financial analysis perspective 
while we incorporate an estimate of sales from pipeline into our business planning and budgeting  pipeline estimates are necessarily speculative and may not consistently correlate to solutions sales in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time 
while we know the amount of solutions backlog available at the beginning of a quarter  we must speculate on our pipeline of solutions opportunities for the quarter 
our accuracy in estimating total solutions sales for future fiscal quarters is  therefore  highly dependent upon our ability to successfully estimate which pipeline opportunities will close during the quarter 
to compete effectively in our target markets in fiscal and beyond  we believe we must continue to transition our products and services to an open  standards based business model 
we have historically provided complete  bundled hardware and software systems using internally developed components to address our customers total business needs 
increasingly  the markets for our products are requiring a shift to the development of products and services based on an open  standards based architecture such as the jee and microsoft s 
net environments utilizing voicexml  ccxml  scxml and or salt standards 
such an open  standards based approach allows customers to independently purchase and combine hardware components  standardized software modules  and customization  installation and integration services from individual vendors deemed to offer the best value in the particular class of product or service 
in such an environment  we believe we may sell less hardware and fewer bundled systems and may become increasingly dependent on our development and sale of software application packages  customized software and consulting and integration services 
this shift will place new challenges on our management to transition our products and to hire and retain the mix of personnel necessary to respond to this business environment  to adapt to the changing expense structure that the new environment may tend to foster  and to increase sales of services  customized software and application packages to offset reduced sales of hardware and bundled systems 
special charges fiscal during fiscal  we incurred approximately million in special charges in connection with three severance and organizational changes affecting approximately positions 
in addition  we incurred approximately million in special charges in connection with the elimination of redundant office leases 
the following table summarizes the effect on reported operating results by financial statement category of all special charges activities for fiscal in millions cost of selling  goods research and general and sold development administrative total severance payments and related benefits facility costs total of this amount  million remained accrued at february  fiscal during fiscal  we incurred approximately million in charges in connection with restructuring expenses for severance and organizational changes affecting approximately persons made at the time of the acquisition of edify

table of contents cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was comprised of the following for the three years ended february   and in millions solution cogs as percentage of solutions sales services cogs as percentage of services revenues total cogs as percentage of total sales during fiscal and  we incurred special charges to cost of goods sold totaling million of sales and million of sales  respectively  as described in the preceding special charges section 
cost of goods sold for fiscal included approximately million of stock compensation expense  resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
r which requires us to include a compensation expense in our financials related to share based awards 
a significant portion of our solutions cost of goods sold is comprised of labor costs that are fixed over the near term as opposed to direct material and license royalty costs that vary directly with sales volume 
the increase in solutions cost of goods sold as a percentage of solutions sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted primarily from the recording of a loss provision of approximately million related to a million media exchange contract entered into in february progress on this percentage of completion project resulted in approximately million of revenue on which we recognized no net margin during fiscal in addition  we recognized no net margin on approximately million of revenue recognized on the first two contracts for our advanced messaging product media exchange for networks 
the increase in solutions costs of goods sold as a percentage of solutions sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted largely from the changes in solution sales volume across the period which occurred without proportional increases or decreases in our fixed labor costs 
in addition  as discussed in the sales section above  we performed significant work during fiscal on the first two contracts for our new advanced messaging product media exchange for networks 
because of the significant effort involved in these initial deployments of this product  we realized no net margin on approximately million of revenue recognized during fiscal during fiscal  our services cost of goods sold increased in dollar amount and remained relatively unchanged as a percentage of services revenues as compared to fiscal levels 
the increase in actual costs related to the increase in services revenues 
during fiscal  our services cost of goods sold declined both in dollar amount and as a percentage of services revenues over fiscal levels 
the reduction in actual costs resulted primarily from contractual reductions in third party costs associated with our international hosted solutions business  reduced telecommunications costs negotiated based on higher volumes in our domestic hosted solutions business  and lower warranty and repairs and maintenance costs 
the reduction in cost as a percent of recurring revenues resulted from these cost savings and from our ability to support net revenue growth in both our maintenance and hosted solutions business with limited additions to our existing cost structure 
our cost of goods sold percentage also benefited from a shift in the geographic mix of some maintenance revenues from areas with a relatively higher cost structure to lower cost areas 
research and development research and development expenses for the three years ended february   and were as follows in millions research and development expenses as percentage of total sales research and development expenses for fiscal included approximately million of stock compensation expense resulting from our adoption of sfas no 
r which requires us to include a compensation expense 
table of contents in our financial statements related to share based awards 
in addition  fiscal included a full year of the impact of the acquisition of edify and the addition of resources to support the technology acquired from nuasis 
we incurred special charges of million of sales and million of sales in fiscal and  respectively  as described in special charges above 
expenses were up approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of the acquisition of edify 
the remainder of the increase in year over year r d expenditures from fiscal to fiscal relates to the continued investment in various research and development initiatives involving packaged applications and voice over ip voip as well as network product offerings 
recurring research and development expenses included the design of new products and the enhancement of existing products 
our research and development spending is focused in six key areas 
first  we are developing software tools to aid in the development and deployment of customer applications incorporating speech recognition  text to speech  and other rich media technologies for enterprises and wireless and wireline providers 
next  we are developing server based application software platforms for operations and management of contact center  speech and call completion applications 
these software platforms are branded under the name media exchange 
we will use these software platforms for deployment and management of enterprise  wireless and wireline network operator applications  which are designed to operate in both jee and microsoft s 
net enterprise computing environments 
third  we are developing media servers  voice browsers  and call processing infrastructure based on open standards such as voicexml  ccxml  scxml and salt 
these media servers are voip enabled  allowing operation in soft switch and hybrid pstn and voip networks 
fourth  we are developing packaged  speech enabled applications for the network operator and enterprise markets 
these include a range of vertical and horizontal applications that are designed to greatly enhance customer return on investment by providing many commonly used configurable functions that can be deployed more quickly than custom applications

selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for the three years ended february   and were as follows in millions selling  general and administrative expenses as percentage of total sales selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal included approximately million due to our adoption of sfas no 
r which requires us to include a compensation expense in our financial statements related to share based awards 
fiscal reflects a full year of the impact of the acquisition of edify which affected salaries  commissions and related expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased approximately million from fiscal to fiscal in addition  depreciation expense increased by approximately million for the same time frame  largely as a result of the start of depreciation related to the sap system which went into production during the third quarter of fiscal fiscal included increases of approximately million for legal expenses primarily related to increased patent and merger and acquisition activities  million for non capitalizable contract labor associated with our sap implementation and million for website development and rebranding efforts 
we incurred sg a charges in connection with the audit committee and sec investigations described in item of part i of this form k of approximately million  or of total sales  during fiscal  million  or of total sales  during fiscal and million  or of total sales  during fiscal 
table of contents sg a expenses included special charges of million of sales and million of sales in fiscal and  respectively  as described in special charges above 
settlement provision fiscal includes approximately million of expense related to an expected payment to the sec based on the current status of discussions with the sec regarding its investigation 
amortization and impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets in connection with our purchase of certain assets from nuasis in fiscal  our purchase of edify in fiscal and brite in fiscal  we recorded intangible assets and goodwill totaling million  million and million  respectively 
the separately identifiable intangible assets were assigned useful lives ranging from months to years 
for the fiscal years ended february   and  we recognized amortization expenses related to these intangible assets as follows in millions amortization of acquisition related intangible assets at february   we had million in remaining net intangible assets other than goodwill which will be subject to amortization in future periods 
the estimated amortization expense attributable to our intangible assets for each of the next five years is as follows in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal we conducted our required annual test of goodwill impairment during the fourth quarters of fiscal  and no impairment of goodwill was indicated 
interest income interest income was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in interest income during fiscal resulted from our positive cash flow and from rising interest rates 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we used approximately million of cash in connection with our acquisition of edify 
as a result  we earned less interest income in fiscal than in fiscal other income expense other income expense during fiscal  and totaling approximately million  million and million  respectively  was comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
fiscal also includes approximately million primarily resulting from the sale of metlife common stock acquired as a result of metlife s demutualization which offsets the foreign currency loss reported in fiscal income taxes we recognized an income tax benefit of million of pretax loss and million of pretax income for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and income tax expense of million of pretax income for fiscal the fiscal percentage differs from the us statutory rate of primarily as a result of the geographic mix of our operating results in foreign markets with varying tax rates and other permanent differences 
the fiscal percentage differs from the us statutory rate of primarily as a result of the release of valuation allowances previously maintained against certain us deferred tax assets and the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies during the year offset  in part  by additional tax expense incurred on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings  all as further discussed below 
the fiscal percentage differs from the us statutory rate of primarily as a result of the taxability in the us of certain dividends deemed to have been received from 
table of contents our foreign subsidiaries  the use of certain fully reserved net operating loss carryforwards and other fully reserved deferred tax assets as further described below and the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies 
during fiscal and  we incurred significant losses 
as a result  we were unable to conclude that it was more likely than not that we would recognize the benefit of our net deferred tax assets  and  accordingly  we established a valuation allowance against such assets 
for the three years ended february   we reported profits on both our consolidated and us operations 
given this history of profitability and our belief that we would continue to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to realize the benefits of certain of our remaining us federal deferred tax assets  in february we benefited our fiscal income tax provision by reversing million of valuation allowance associated with such assets 
we continue to provide valuation allowances on foreign and state deferred tax assets and on certain us federal deferred tax assets that will benefit equity if and when realized 
these valuation allowances are provided because of remaining uncertainty about the realizability of such assets 
during fiscal  we resolved various tax contingencies arising out of our us  us  german and mea operations 
the resolution of all such items resulted in a million reduction in our tax expense for fiscal and was associated with the completion of audits of certain of our international tax returns and with the closing of certain tax periods due to the passage of time 
on october   the american jobs creation act the ajca was signed into law 
the ajca provides for a deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the ajca 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we elected to repatriate million from our uk subsidiary pursuant to the provisions of the ajca 
in doing so  we incurred related income tax expense of approximately million 
our us taxable income for fiscal included distributions deemed to have been made to our us company by several of our foreign subsidiaries  including  particularly  our uk subsidiary 
such deemed distributions stemmed from the existence and ultimate settlement of intercompany debt owed by the us entity to certain of our foreign subsidiaries and from the pledging of certain uk assets as collateral for a term loan that was outstanding for a portion of fiscal during fiscal  we used net operating losses carried forward from previous years and the reversal of certain temporary differences to offset virtually all of our us taxable income 
as a result  our current tax expense was limited to a small amount of us alternative minimum tax expense and to tax expense on our international operations 
the reversal of a portion of our deferred tax asset valuation allowances offset the deferred tax expense we would otherwise have incurred as a result of using the assets  and  as a result  our overall effective tax rate for the years was substantially less than the statutory rates 
tax expense for fiscal also reflected the benefit of a million favorable tax settlement with a foreign government reached during the year 
at february   we had us federal net operating loss carryforwards totaling million 
this amount  if not used  will expire beginning in fiscal all of these federal net operating loss carryforwards arose from employee stock option exercises 
as a result  the realization of such carryforwards when used to reduce federal tax payments in fiscal and future years will increase equity and will not reduce our tax provision for those years 
income from operations and net income we generated loss from operations of million and net loss of million during fiscal and income from operations and net income were million and million  respectively  during fiscal in fiscal  our loss was primarily attributable to the increased research and development and other operating expenses to support the two acquisition activities undertaken late in fiscal and in fiscal and the increased investment in sales initiatives and marketing rebranding efforts to increase sales as well as stock based compensation expense  increased restructuring expenses and loss provisions for a contract and the current status of settlement discussions with the sec 
in fiscal  our reduced operating profitability was primarily attributable to the significant decline in our solution sales from prior year levels 
the effect of this sales reduction on our fiscal net income was mitigated  in part  by the large tax benefits associated with the reversal of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets as described above 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at february   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  and we had no debt outstanding 
operating cash flows for fiscal were impacted by increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
our accounts receivable at february  included approximately million from a venezuelan customer 
given the delays that we have experienced in collection of this receivable  we will return to the cash basis of accounting for future transactions with this customer 
our days sales outstanding of accounts receivable was days at february   up from days at february  due to the timing of billings within the quarter combined with the effect of the delayed collection of the venezuelan receivable 
for sales of certain of our more complex  customized solutions generally those with a sales price of  or more  we recognize revenue based on a percentage of completion methodology 
unbilled receivables accrued under this methodology totaled million of total net receivables at february   as compared to million of total receivables at february  we expect to bill and collect unbilled receivables as of february  within the next twelve months 
we generate a significant percentage of our sales  particularly sales of network solutions  outside the united states 
customers in certain countries are subject to significant economic and political challenges that affect their cash flow  and many customers outside the united states are generally accustomed to vendor financing in the form of extended payment terms 
to remain competitive in markets outside the united states  we may offer selected customers such payment terms 
in all cases  however  we only recognize revenue at such time as our solution or service fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
in some limited cases  this policy may result in our recognizing revenue on a cash basis  limiting revenue recognition on certain sales of solutions and or services to the actual cash received to date from the customer  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
we used million of cash in net investing activities during fiscal of this amount  we used million for payment of expenses related to the acquisition of edify  million in the purchase of certain assets from nuasis  million to purchase equipment to expand our hosted solutions business  million for costs in connection with our sap implementation  and the remaining million for replacement and expansion of our computing infrastructure and other capital purchases 
we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal actual capital expenditures  however  are dependent  in part  on the level of expenditures made in connection with expansion of our hosted solutions business and could vary from this amount 
during fiscal  our financing activities provided million in net cash flow 
our option holders exercised options for million shares of common stock and  in so doing  provided us with million of cash 
financing activities also included approximately million related to excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options 
letter of credit facility in february  we terminated our existing line of credit and entered into a new letter of credit line with the lender 
the letter of credit line provides that the lender will issue letters of credit not to exceed the principal amount of million 
at february   letters of credit totaling approximately million were outstanding 
any draft actually paid by the lender will bear interest at a rate of one fourth of one percent above the prime rate until the amount is repaid 
this agreement contains certain representations and warranties  certain negative and affirmative covenants  and certain conditions and events of default which are customarily required for similar financings 
as of february   we were in compliance with all such covenants 

table of contents summary of future obligations the following table summarizes our obligations and commitments as of february   to be paid in fiscal through in millions payments due by period fiscal year ending february nature of commitment operating lease payments firm purchase commitments total obligations and commitments the operating lease payments shown above were our only off balance sheet arrangements at february  most of our purchases are executed under cancelable purchase orders 
the firm purchase commitments shown above are comprised of non cancelable commitments for certain communications charges and royalties 
we believe our cash reserves and internally generated cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
impact of inflation we do not expect any significant short term impact of inflation on our financial condition 
technological advances should continue to reduce costs in the computer and communications industries 
further  we presently are not bound by long term fixed price sales contracts 
the absence of such contracts should reduce our exposure to inflationary effects

in addition  we incurred approximately million in special charges in connection with the elimination of redundant office leases 
we also recorded a loss provision of approximately million related to a contract and a loss provision of approximately million related to the current status of settlement discussions with the sec 
we acquired all of the outstanding stock of edify on december  beginning december   our financial results include the operations of edify 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we incurred approximately million in charges in connection with restructuring expenses for severance and organizational changes affecting approximately persons made at the time of the acquisition of edify 
in addition  for the fourth quarter of fiscal  our income tax provision included benefits totaling million resulting from the reversal of valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets and from the resolution of tax contingencies  partially offset by a charge of million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities that generally have maturities of days or less 
the carrying value of these securities approximates market value  and there is no long term interest rate risk associated with these investments 
foreign currency risks we transact business in certain foreign currencies including  particularly  the british pound and the euro 
our primary software application development  research and development and other administrative activities are conducted from offices in the united states and the united kingdom  and our primary manufacturing operations are conducted in the united states 
virtually all sales arranged through our us offices are denominated in us dollars  which is the functional and reporting currency of our us entity 
sales arranged through our uk subsidiary are denominated in various currencies  including the british pound  the us dollar and the euro  however  the uk subsidiary s functional currency is the british pound 
for the fiscal year ended february   sales originating from our uk subsidiary represented approximately of consolidated sales 
as a result of our international operations  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in certain foreign currency exchange rates 
we have not historically used foreign currency options or forward contracts to hedge our currency exposures because of variability in the timing of cash flows associated with our larger contracts  and we did not have any such hedge instruments in place at february  rather  we attempt to mitigate our foreign currency risk by generally transacting business in the functional currency of each of our major subsidiaries  thus creating natural hedges by paying expenses incurred in the local currency in which revenues will be received 
as noted above  our operating results are exposed to changes in certain exchange rates including  particularly  those between the us dollar  the british pound and the euro 
when the us dollar strengthens against the other currencies  our sales are negatively affected upon the translation of uk operating results to the reporting currency 
the effect of these changes on our operating profits varies depending on the level of british pound denominated expenses and the uk subsidiary s overall profitability 
for the fiscal year ended february   the result of a hypothetical  uniform strengthening in the value of the us dollar relative to the british pound and the euro would have been a decrease in sales of approximately million and an increase in net income of approximately million 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales and or operating expenses  changes in exchange rates also could affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices
