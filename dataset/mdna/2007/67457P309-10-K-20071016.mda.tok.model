item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included beginning on page f of this form k 
the discussion in this form k contains both historical information and forward looking statements 
a number of factors affect our operating results and could cause our actual future results to differ materially from any forward looking results discussed below 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as anticipates  appears  believes  continue  could  estimates  expects  feels  goal  hope  intends  may  our future success depends  plans  potential  predicts  projects  reasonably  seek to continue  should  thinks  will or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
these statements are only predictions 
actual events or results may differ materially 
in addition  historical information should not be considered an indicator of future performance 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include  but are not limited to  the risks discussed in part i  item a of this form k under the caption risk factors 
these factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward looking statements 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance  or achievements 
moreover  we are under no duty to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this form k to conform these statements to actual results 
these forward looking statements are made in reliance upon the safe harbour provision of the private securities litigation reform act of restatement of consolidated financial statements on october   we announced that the audit committee of our board of directors had completed its previously announced internal review of our revenue recognition practices 
as a result of the review  we determined that our previously filed consolidated financial statements for the following periods required restatement i our fiscal years ended december  and december   ii each of the interim quarterly periods in our fiscal years ended december  and december   and iii each of the interim quarterly periods ended march  june  and september  the adjustments resulting from the restatement relate solely to revenue recognition matters 
the restatement adjustments did not affect our reported cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances as of the end of any fiscal period 
specifically  we determined that a restatement was required because we incorrectly accounted for the following categories of transactions i transactions involving commitments to certain customers in connection with sales for features or deliverables that were not available at the time revenue was originally recognized  including commitments to prospectively provide free product  software  training  and installation services  for which we prematurely recognized approximately million in revenue from fiscal to fiscal  ii sales to value added resellers where the resellers did not have the ability to pay us for these sales independent of payment to them by the end user  for which we prematurely recognized approximately million in revenue from fiscal to fiscal  and iii for certain quarters ending on weekends  transactions involving our use of a shipping vendor who picked up product for subsequent delivery to another shipping company where the terms and conditions of the shipments did not appropriately transfer title or risk of loss at the time of shipment  for which we prematurely recognized approximately million in revenue from fiscal to fiscal in addition  we prematurely recognized approximately million of revenue from fiscal through fiscal relating principally to errors in accounting for software and software maintenance  customer credits  and undelivered free product 
in determining that a restatement was required  we accounted for hardware sales and related cost of sales in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition  or sab we accounted for software sales in accordance with aicpa statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  or sop we accounted for sales with multiple deliverables in accordance with emerging issues task force  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf overview we develop  market and support innovative broadband access products designed to enable telecom service providers to offer bundled voice  video and data  or triple play  services over both copper and fiber optic networks 
our broadband loop carrier  or blc  is an integrated hardware and software platform that uses internet protocol  or ip  and ethernet technologies to increase the capacity of local access networks  enabling our customers to deliver advanced services  including voice over ip  or voip  ip based television  or iptv  and high definition television  or hdtv 
our platform simultaneously supports traditional voice services  enabling our customers to leverage their existing networks and migrate to ip without disruption 
in addition to providing our customers with increased bandwidth  our products provide incremental value by offering software based features to improve the quality  resiliency and security of triple play services 
we market our products through a combination of direct and indirect channels 
our direct sales efforts are focused on the independent operating company  or ioc  segment of the telecom service provider market 
we also target larger telecom service providers through strategic reseller relationships 
as of december   we had shipped our blc platform to over customers 
from our inception through december   we have incurred cumulative net losses of approximately million 
we realized income from operations and were profitable on a net income basis during the quarters ended september  and december  and for the year ended december  previously  we had not been profitable on a quarterly or annual basis  excluding the quarter ended december   in which we realized modest operating income of  beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  however  we began to experience a softening in our business 
we experienced operating and net losses in the second quarter of fiscal and currently expect to experience operating and net losses for the third quarter and full fiscal year 
we believe the softening that we have experienced in our markets since the first quarter of fiscal is attributable in part to delays associated with our customers evaluations of strategic investment decisions concerning their movement from copper wire to fiber  in part to a shift in our customer base toward longer term loan projects funded by the us department of agriculture s rural utilities service  or rus program  and delays in our financial reporting 
prior to january   when we adopted a calendar year end for fiscal reporting purposes  we prepared our financial statements with the end of each quarter falling on the last sunday of each calendar quarter 
as a result  our accounting quarters did not necessarily coincide with the last day of the calendar month 
effective january   we adopted a calendar fiscal year end 
the quarter end dates for fiscal were march  june  september  and december critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories  litigation  warranty reserve and valuation of deferred income tax assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize sales revenue when persuasive evidence of sales arrangements exist  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the buyer s price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
we allow credit for products returned within our policy terms 
in addition to the aforementioned general policy  we enter into transactions that represent multiple element arrangements  which may include training and post sales technical support and maintenance to our customers as needed to assist them in installation or use of our products  and make provisions for these costs in the periods of sale 
multiple element arrangements are assessed to determine whether they can be separated into more than one unit of accounting 
a multiple element arrangement is separated into more than one unit of accounting if all of the following criteria are met the delivered item s has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  or delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
if these criteria are not met  then sales are deferred until such criteria are met or until the period s over which the last undelivered element is delivered 
if there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting in an arrangement  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each unit s relative fair value 
in certain circumstances  we enter into arrangements with customers who receive financing support in the form of long term low interest rate loans from the united states department of agriculture s rural utilities service  or rus 
the terms of the rus contracts provide that in certain instances transfer of title of our products does not occur until customer acceptance 
in these cases  we do not recognize revenue until payment has been received  assuming the remaining revenue recognition criteria are met 
we believe payment  which contractually occurs after written customer acceptance  provides superior assurance for revenue recognition purposes 
in certain circumstances  we enter into transactions with value added resellers where the resellers may not have the ability to pay us for these sales independent of payment to them by the end user 
in these cases  we do not recognize revenue until payment has been received  assuming the remaining revenue recognition criteria are met 
we further warrant our products for periods up to five years and record an estimated warranty accrual when sales revenue is recognized 
valuation of inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of acquisition cost or market value 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand and market conditions and compare them with current inventory levels 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred tax valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax asset to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
for   and  our net deferred tax assets have been offset with a full valuation allowance 
loss contingencies we evaluate our estimated potential financial exposure for loss contingencies  particularly the pending litigation matters discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  we accrue an estimated loss related to a contingency if a it is probable that a liability had been incurred and future events will occur confirming the fact of the loss at the date of the consolidated financial statements and b the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
when a reasonable estimate of the loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount  we accrue the minimum amount in the range 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimated potential liability could materially impact our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
we have not recorded an accrual for an estimated loss for the ipo allocation case because we believe the anticipated settlement amounts are covered by our insurance policies 
product warranties we provide a standard warranty with the sale of our products for up to five years from the date of shipment 
the estimated cost of providing the product warranty is recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
we maintain product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers 
we quantify and record an estimate for warranty related costs based on our actual history  projected return and failure rates and current repair costs 
our estimates are based on the actual number of products returned for repairs  an estimate of products that may be returned for warranty repair and estimated costs of repair depending on the type of service required 
these estimates require us to examine past warranty issues and consider their continuing impact in the future 
our accrual is based on consideration of all these factors which are known as of the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
to the extent that actual warranty repairs are higher than our estimates  our costs will increase 
stock based compensation effective beginning the first fiscal quarter of  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  using the modified prospective method 
under this method  compensation costs for all awards granted after the date of adoption and the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding at the date of adoption are measured at estimated fair value and included in cost of sales and operating expenses over the vesting period during which an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
prior period amounts presented herein have not been restated to reflect the adoption of sfas no 
r 
upon adoption of sfas r  we selected the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate model for determining the estimated fair value for stock based awards 
the use of the black scholes model requires the use of extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and the use of a number of complex assumptions including expected volatility  forfeitures  and expected dividends 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we do not anticipate declaring dividends in the foreseeable future 
expected volatility is based on the annualized weekly historical volatility of our stock price and we believe it is indicative of future volatility 
we estimate the expected life of options granted based on historical exercise and post vesting cancellation patterns with consideration to our industry peers of similar size with similar option vesting periods 
our analysis of stock price volatility and option lives involves management s best estimates at the time of determination 
sfas r also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options or stock units that are expected to vest 
therefore  we apply an estimated forfeiture rate that is derived from historical employee termination behavior 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
results of operations fiscal years ended december   december   and december  sales fiscal year ended december  december  december  restated restated sales    see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  of notes to consolidated financial statements  beginning on page f the increase in sales for fiscal year over the prior years was mainly due to an expanded customer base  repeat orders from existing customers and increased sales of blc products  related accessories and cabinets 
the growth in blc system sales  and our sales in general  followed the release of the blc system product line during the third quarter of in and  several enhancements and new features were introduced to the blc system  which resulted in greater market penetration and sales 
we do not expect our revenues in future periods to grow at the same rates they have grown during recent periods and expect revenues in to grow  if at all  only modestly relative to in particular  beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  we identified a softening in our business that we believe is attributable to adverse trends affecting our target customer markets  delays associated with our customers evaluations of strategic investment decisions concerning their movement from copper wire to fiber  and uncertainty concerning our financial reporting while we were delinquent in our filings with the sec and subject to a delisting proceeding from the nasdaq global market 
cost of sales and gross margin loss fiscal year ended december  december  december  restated restated cost of sales    gross margin loss   gross margin loss see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  of notes to consolidated financial statements  beginning on page f cost of sales includes the cost of products shipped for which sales were recognized  warranty costs  costs of any manufacturing yield problems  field replacements  rework costs  manufacturing overhead  provisions for obsolete inventory and the cost of post sales support 
the increases in cost of sales during fiscal and were attributable principally to increased shipments and sales of our products 
the improvement in our gross margins from fiscal to was primarily due to reductions in product manufacturing costs and inventory carrying costs  partially offset by post sales customer service costs 
cost of sales and gross margin for were adversely affected by additional costs of million arising from yield problems and unusually high repair costs on certain new products 
management believes these costs were necessary to maintain customer satisfaction 
as of december  and december   we had accruals of million and million  respectively  to cover estimated repair costs on remaining field units 
these accruals were based upon experience with failures of certain parts and based on estimated repair costs 
we expect that our gross margins will vary from quarter to quarter due in part to variations in product mix 
for example  our gross margin percentages were    and in the first  second  third  and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively 
to the extent that cabinets and other lower margin products represent an increased percentage of our total sales in any period  it will tend to reduce our gross margin 
research and product development expenses fiscal year ended december  december  december  restated restated research and product development expenses    percentage of sales see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  of notes to consolidated financial statements  beginning on page f research and product development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs  prototype component and assembly costs  third party design services and consulting costs  and other costs related to design  development  and testing of our products 
research and product development costs are expensed as incurred  except for capital expenditures  which are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives  generally two to five years 
research and product development expenses remained flat from to and increased from to the increase in research and product development expenses from to was attributable to increased personnel related costs  stock based compensation charges  and third party design costs 
we expect research and product development expenses to continue to increase in future periods as we continue to make investments in our products and technologies 
sales and marketing expenses fiscal year ended december  december  december  restated restated sales and marketing expenses    percentage of sales see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  of notes to consolidated financial statements  beginning on page f sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  sales commissions  and other personnel related costs  development and distribution of promotional materials  and other costs related to generating sales and conducting corporate marketing activities 
sales and marketing expenses increased from to because of increased headcount  increased commission and other sales and promotional costs incurred in an effort to increase sales and market penetration 
sales and marketing expenses increased from to due primarily to increased headcount  stock based compensation expense  commissions  and customer trial equipment expenses incurred to support our sales and marketing efforts 
we expect sales and marketing costs to continue to increase in as we continue to make expenditures intended to increase sales and market penetration 
general and administrative expenses fiscal year ended december  december  december  restated restated general and administrative expenses    percentage of sales see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  of notes to consolidated financial statements  beginning on page f general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs for executive  finance  human resources  and administrative personnel 
additionally  general and administrative expenses include professional fees  liability insurance and other general corporate costs 
general and administrative expenses increased from to primarily due to sarbanes oxley compliance costs and the write off of a  loan provided to the buyer of our subsidiary in india 
general and administrative expense increased from to as a result of increased salaries  stock based compensation expense  and nasdaq relisting fees incurred during we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase substantially in  in large part due to professional fees and expenses resulting from the audit committee review of our revenue recognition practices  increased headcount  and the cost of remediating internal control weaknesses identified in connection with the audit committee review 
stock based compensation fiscal year ended december  december  december  restated restated cost of sales research and product development sales and marketing general and administrative total stock based compensation  see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  of notes to consolidated financial statements  beginning on page f through december   we recorded total deferred stock compensation of approximately million  representing the difference between the deemed value of our common stock for accounting purposes and the exercise price of the options at their date of grant 
we amortized deferred stock based compensation over the vesting periods of the applicable options  or repurchase periods for the exercised options  generally over four years 
through december   we had reversed deferred stock compensation of approximately million  resulting from stock option cancellations and repurchase of unvested common shares from employees 
effective as of the first quarter of fiscal  we began recording the fair value of our share based compensation in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment revised  or sfas no 
r 
we anticipate that the stock based compensation expense calculated under sfas no 
r will continue to have a material effect on our consolidated statement of operations 
interest income and expense fiscal year ended december  december  december  restated restated interest income interest expense see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  of notes to consolidated financial statements  beginning on page f in  the increase in interest income was principally attributable to higher average cash balances  resulting from the completion of our secondary public offering in november  and  to a lesser extent  higher interest rates during interest expense decreased significantly in as compared to due to the repayment of our outstanding debt in early the increase in interest expense in was attributable to increased debt levels as compared to income tax benefit expense we offset approximately of our federal and state tax liabilities in through the utilization of our net operating loss carry forwards 
the remaining of our taxable income was taxed at an effective rate of  primarily to cover federal and state alternative minimum tax  and was recorded to income tax expense 
net operating loss carry forwards as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and million to offset federal and state future taxable income  respectively 
the federal and state net operating loss carry forwards will expire beginning in and  respectively 
we have determined that as of december   million and million of these respective federal and state loss carry forwards are subject to annual limitations pursuant to internal revenue code section and similar state provisions 
beneficial conversion feature fiscal year ended december  december  december  restated restated beneficial conversion feature    see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  of notes to consolidated financial statements  beginning on page f in  we recorded beneficial conversion feature charges to net loss attributable to common stockholders of million related to the issuance of our series a preferred stock in february in  we recorded beneficial conversion feature charges to net loss attributable to common stockholders of million related to the issuance of our series a preferred stock during that fiscal year and  related to the amortization of preferred stock warrants 
we recorded beneficial conversion feature charges to net loss attributable to common stockholders of million upon the issuance of our series a preferred stock and warrants during these non cash charges were calculated using the deemed value of common stock on date of issuance  subtracting the accounting conversion price and then multiplying the resulting amount by the number of shares of common stock into which the series a preferred stock was convertible 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million as compared to million as of december  the net increase in cash and cash equivalents was principally the result of the closing of our secondary public offering in november  which raised million in net proceeds  as well as the issuance of additional shares of series a preferred stock in connection with a rights offering in february  which raised million in net proceeds 
offsetting our cash balances was the repayment of million in outstanding indebtedness in february as of december   we had restricted cash of million related to performance bonds we are required to post in connection with our rus contracts 
we generated million of cash from operating activities during the fiscal year ended december   compared to a use of million in operating activities during the fiscal year ended december  the increase was principally attributable to increases in net income  accounts payable and deferred sales  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
we used million of cash in investing activities during the fiscal year ended december   compared to a use of million during the fiscal year ended december  the decrease was attibutable to a smaller increase of restricted cash related to the purchase of performance bonds for rus contracts 
financing activities generated million of cash during the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  the principal contributors to cash from financing activities were our secondary public offering in november and the rights offering completed in february working capital working capital increased to million at december   compared to million at december  the increase was principally attributable to the completion of the secondary public offering  which raised million of net proceeds  and the rights offering  which raised million in net proceeds 
also contributing to the increase in working capital was cash provided by net income  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to finance our operations over the next months 
although we believe these funds will be sufficient to maintain and expand our operations in accordance with our business strategy  we may need additional funds in the future 
if we are unable to raise additional financing when and if needed  we may be required to reduce certain discretionary spending  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives 
we lease our facilities and certain assets under non cancelable operating leases expiring through  excluding various renewal options 
on october   occam and cortona opportunity ltd 
entered into a commercial building lease agreement 
the seven year lease provides for the lease by occam of approximately  square feet in a building located in santa barbara  california 
base rent under the lease agreement is set at  per month 
the following table summarizes our minimum purchase commitment to our contract manufacturers and our minimum commitments under non cancelable operating leases as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations purchase commitments   operating leases    contractual obligations consist of future minimum lease payments under operating leases used in the normal course of business and purchase commitments 
our headquarters lease in santa barbara  california expired in october we entered into a month to month lease arrangements through the end of march  with similar terms and conditions as the original lease 
in november  we entered into a new lease agreement for our headquarters in santa barbara 
the terms of the leases were disclosed in a current report on form k we filed with the sec in december under the terms of our agreement with our contract manufacturer  we issue purchase orders for the production of our products 
we are required to place orders in advance with our contract manufacturer to meet estimated sales demands 
the agreement includes certain lead time and cancellation provisions 
future amounts payable to the contract manufacturer will vary based on the level of purchase requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no material off balance sheet arrangements  other than the operating leases described above 
indemnification obligations we enter into indemnification provisions under our agreements with other companies in our ordinary course of business  typically with our contractors  customers  landlords and our agreements with investors 
under these provisions  we generally indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of our activities or  in some cases  as a result of the indemnified party s activities under the agreement 
these indemnification provisions generally survive termination of the underlying agreement 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is generally unlimited 
we have not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnifications agreements 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  and december  recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued fsp no 
fin definition of settlement in fasb interpretation no 
 fsp fin amends fin to provide guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax provision is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits 
the term effectively settled replaces the term ultimately settled when used to describe recognition  and the terms settlement or settled replace the terms ultimate settlement or ultimately settled when used to describe measurement of a tax position under fin fsp fin clarifies that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished 
for tax positions considered effectively settled  an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit  even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statue of limitations remains open 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of fsp fin will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position  although we are continuing to evaluate the full impact of the adoption of fsp fin in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards which require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value 
under sfas  a company may elect to use fair value to measure accounts and loans receivable  available for sale and held to maturity securities  equity method investments  accounts payable  guarantees and issued debt 
other eligible items include firm commitments for financial instruments that otherwise would not be recognized at inception and non cash warranty obligations where a warrantor is permitted to pay a third party to provide warranty goods or services 
if the use of fair value is elected  any upfront cost and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred 
the fair value election is irrevocable and generally made on an instrument by instrument basis even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure at fair value 
at the adoption date  unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas  changes to fair value are recognized in earnings 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and is required to be adopted by occam in the first quarter of we are currently determining whether fair value accounting is appropriate for any of our eligible items and cannot currently estimate the impact  if any  which sfas will have on our consolidated results of operation and financial condition

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab no 
provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab no 
establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects of each of the company s balance sheets and statement of operations and the related financial statement disclosures 
sab no 
permits existing public companies to record the cumulative effect of initially applying this approach in the first year ending after november  by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
additionally  the use of the cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose
