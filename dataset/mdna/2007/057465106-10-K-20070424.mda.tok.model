construction costs to remodel stores into the new format average approximately  and the remodeling typically requires the store to be closed for six to seven weeks 
we plan to remodel existing stores into the new format in locations where we believe the additional investment will produce a higher return on investment than maintaining the current format 
we remodeled bakers stores in fiscal year  bakers stores in fiscal year and bakers stores in fiscal year into the new format 
we 
table of contents currently plan to remodel approximately existing bakers stores into the new format during fiscal year typically  our stores are remodeled in connection with lease renewals 
we will close existing stores at the end of their current lease terms when we do not believe that remodeling into our new format will generate an acceptable economic return or when we otherwise cannot renew leases under terms that are mutually acceptable to us and our landlords 
closing underperforming stores allows us to better focus on our growth objectives

increasing comparable store sales 
we attempt to keep our product mix fresh and on target by constantly testing new fashions and actively monitoring sell through rates in our stores 
our team of footwear retailers  in house designers and merchants use their industry experience  relationships with agents and branded footwear producers  and their participation in industry trade shows to analyze  interpret and translate fashion trends affecting today s young women into the footwear and accessory styles they desire 
we employ a test and react strategy that constantly updates our product mix while managing inventory risk 
this strategy is supported by our strong relationships with manufacturers  which allow our merchandising and buying teams to negotiate short lead times  enabling us to test new styles and react quickly to fashion trends and keep fast moving inventory in stock 
we seek to continually improve the quality of our footwear offerings in order to meet our customers expectations and to allow us to strategically increase our price points 
to complement the introduction of new merchandise  we view the majority of our styles as core fashion styles that carry over for multiple seasons 
our merchants make subtle changes to these styles each season to keep them fresh  while reducing our fashion risk exposure 
we also intend to drive comparable store sales increases through an enhanced offering of accessories and through the introduction and expansion of branded accessories 
accessories accounted for of merchandise sales in fiscal year and we believe that there is significant potential to expand our accessory sales and margins 
our stores sell national branded footwear because we believe that branded merchandise is important to our customers  adds credibility to our stores and drives customer traffic  increasing our overall sales volume and profitability  while reducing our overall exposure to fashion risk 
we believe the presence of national branded merchandise in our product mix will also increase the sales of our private label merchandise 
we continue to add sought after brands and to enhance the value of our private label assortment 
approximately of our net shoe sales for fiscal year consisted of branded footwear 
expanding into new retail channels 
since we began operating our internet store in fiscal year  our internet sales have grown rapidly 
for fiscal year  our internet and catalog sales were million 
we believe our web presence is important in expanding our ability to reach our target customer base and enhances the services we provide our customers 
furthermore  we believe our internet store increases customer traffic at our bakers stores and enables potential customers to locate our stores 
in  we introduced our bakers catalog to existing and prospective customers 
we believe that the catalog allows us to broaden our appeal by showcasing our stylish image and upscale offerings 
we anticipate issuing five catalogs during fiscal year and expect to expand the average mailing from  copies to as many as  copies 
we believe that our catalogs provide a new channel for our customers to purchase our merchandise and will increase traffic at our internet store and our mall stores 

table of contents product development and merchandising our merchants analyze  interpret and translate current and emerging lifestyle trends into footwear and accessories for our customers 
our merchants and senior management use various methods to monitor changes in culture and fashion 
our buyers travel to major domestic and international markets  such as new york  london and milan  to gain an understanding of fashion trends 
we attend major footwear trade shows and analyze various information services which provide broad themes on the direction of fashion and color for upcoming seasons 
we also monitor current music  television  movie and magazine themes as they relate to clothing and footwear styles 
a crucial element of our product development is our test and react strategy 
we typically buy small quantities of new footwear and deliver merchandise to a cross section of stores 
we closely monitor sell through rates on test merchandise and  if the tests are successful  quickly re order product to be distributed to a larger base of stores 
frequently  in as little as a week  we can make initial determinations as to the results of a product test 
our senior management team has extensive experience in retail and in responding to changes in our business 
we work with merchandisers  buyers and our distribution system to attempt to respond timely to changes in consumer trends while effectively controlling overhead and inventory 
in addition to our test and react strategy  we also moderate our fashion risk exposure through the national branded component of our merchandise mix 
the national brands carried by our stores tend to focus on fashion basic merchandise supported by national advertising by the producer of the brand  which helps generate demand from our target customer 
we believe we gain substantial brand affinity by carrying these lines 
we believe that a customer who enters our store with the intent of shopping for national branded footwear will also consider the purchase of our lower price  higher gross margin private label merchandise 
product mix we sell both casual and dress footwear 
casual footwear includes sport shoes  sandals  athletic shoes  outdoor footwear  casual daywear  weekend casual  casual booties and tall shafted boots 
dress footwear includes career footwear  tailored shoes  dress shoes  special occasion shoes and dress booties 
private label 
our private label merchandise  which comprised approximately of our net shoe sales in fiscal year  is generally sold under the bakers label and  in some instances  is supplied to us on an exclusive basis 
the average retail prices of our private label footwear generally range from to we are able to offer these prices without sacrificing merchandise quality  creating a high perceived value  promoting multiple sale transactions  and allowing us to build a loyal customer base 
once our management team has arrived at a consensus on fashion themes for the upcoming season  our buyers translate these themes into our merchandise 
to produce our private label footwear  we generally begin with a shoe that our buying teams have discovered during their travels or that is brought to us by one of our commissioned buying agents 
working with our agents  we develop a prototype shoe  which we refer to as a sample 
we control the process by focusing on key color  fabric and pattern selections  and collaborate with our buying agents to establish production deadlines 
once our buyers have approved the sample  our buying agents arrange for the purchase of necessary materials and contract with factories to manufacture the footwear to our specifications 
we establish manufacturing deadlines in order to ensure a consistent flow of inventory into the stores 
our disciplined product development process results in relatively short lead times 
depending upon where the shoes are produced and where the materials are sourced  we can have shoes delivered to our stores in four to weeks 
for more information  please see sourcing and distribution 
our success depends upon our customers perception of new and fresh merchandise 
our test and react strategy reduces our risk on new styles of footwear 
we also reduce our markdown risk by re interpreting our core product 
approximately one half of our private label mix is core product  which we define as styles that carry over for multiple seasons 
our buyers make changes to core product which include colors  fabrications and modified styling to create renewed interest among our customers 
we also have relationships with some producers of national brands that  from time to time  produce comparable versions of their branded footwear under our private label brands 

table of contents our information systems are designed to identify trends by item  style  color and or size 
in response  our merchandise team generates a key item report to more carefully monitor and support sales  including reordering additional units of certain items  if available 
merchandising teams and buyers work together to develop new styles to be presented at monthly product review and selection meetings 
these new styles incorporate variations on existing styles in an effort to capitalize further on the more popular silhouettes and heel heights or entirely new styles and fabrications that respond to emerging trends or customer preferences 
national brands 
our stores carry nationally recognized branded merchandise which we believe increases the attractiveness of our product offering to our target customers 
our branded shoe sales comprised approximately of our net shoe sales for fiscal year we believe that branded merchandise is important to our customers  adds credibility to our stores and drives customer traffic resulting in increased customer loyalty and sales 
important national brands in our stores include jessica simpson  bcbgirls  guess sport  steve madden  rocket dog  and baby phat 
we believe offering nationally recognized brands is a key element to attracting appearance conscious young women 
branded merchandise sells at a higher price point than our private label merchandise 
as a result  despite a lower gross margin percentage  branded merchandise generates greater gross profits per pair and leverages our operating costs 
accessories 
we have upgraded our accessories in the same manner as we upgraded our footwear offerings 
we have introduced branded accessories and have also upgraded our private label offerings 
our accessories include handbags  jewelry  sunglasses  ear clips and earrings  hosiery  scarves and other items 
our accessory products allow us to offer the convenience of one stop shopping to our customers  enabling them to complement their seasonal ready to wear clothing with color coordinated footwear and accessories 
accessories add to our overall sales and typically generate higher gross margins than our footwear 
merchandise mix 
the following table illustrates net sales by merchandise category as a percentage of our total net sales for fiscal years fiscal year category private label footwear branded footwear accessories total merchandise mix during our transition period in january was not materially different from that in the table 
planning and allocation 
we have developed a micro merchandising strategy for each of our bakers stores through market research and sales experience 
we maintain the level and type of styles demanded by subsets of our target customers 
we have categorized each of our bakers stores as being predominantly a mainstream  fashion or urban location  and if appropriate we identify subcategories for certain stores 
we have implemented a similar micro merchandising strategy for our wild pair stores 
our micro merchandising strategy of classifying multiple stores and merchandising them similarly based upon customer demographics enables our merchants to provide an appropriate merchandise mix in order to meet that particular store s customers casual  weekend club  career and special occasion needs 
in determining the appropriate merchandise mix and inventory levels for a particular store  among other factors  we consider selling history  
table of contents importance of branded footwear  importance of accessories  importance of aggressive fashion  the stock capacity of the store  sizing trends and color preferences 
our merchandising plan includes sales  inventory and profitability targets for each product classification 
this plan is reconciled with our store sales plan  a compilation of individual store sales projections that is developed semi annually  but reforecasted monthly 
we also update the merchandising plan on a monthly basis to reflect current sales and inventory trends 
the plan is then distributed throughout the merchandising department  which analyzes trends on a weekly  and sometimes daily  basis 
we use the reforecasted merchandising plan to adjust production orders as needed to meet inventory and sales targets 
this process helps to control our inventory levels and markdowns 
our buyers typically order merchandise to days in advance of anticipated delivery 
this strategy allows us to react to both the positive and negative trends and customer preferences identified through our information systems and other tracking procedures 
through this purchasing strategy  we can take advantage of positive trends by quickly replenishing our inventory of popular products 
this strategy also reduces our exposure to risk because we are less likely to be overstocked with less desirable items 
during a challenging retail environment  we can react quickly to declining sales trends by reducing purchases and keeping inventories in line to manage our markdown exposure 
clearance 
we utilize rigorous clearance and markdown procedures to reduce our inventory of slower moving styles 
our management carefully monitors pricing and markdowns to facilitate the introduction of new merchandise and to maintain the freshness of our fashion image 
we have five clearance sales each year  which coincide with the end of a particular selling season 
for more information regarding our selling seasons  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 
you should also refer to seasonality and to risk factors our overall profitability is highly dependent upon our fourth quarter results 
during a clearance sale  we instruct our stores to systematically lower the price of the items  and if not sold  to ship them to one of our to stores which have special clearance sections 
we believe that our test and react strategy and our careful monitoring of inventories and consumer buying trends help us to reduce sales at clearance prices 
stores store locations and environment 
our stores are designed to attract customers who are intrigued by a young and contemporary lifestyle and to create an inviting  exciting atmosphere in which it is fun for them to shop in locations where they want to shop 
our stores average approximately  square feet and are primarily located in regional shopping malls 
as of february   six of our stores  which are located in dense urban markets such as new york city and chicago  have freestanding street locations 
we believe that we are also able to operate in a wide range of shopping mall classifications 
as a result  we continue to operate a number of our stores that may not merit the same level of investment as our new format stores but that generate a reasonable return on investment 
our stores are designed to create a clean  upscale boutique environment  featuring contemporary finishings and sophisticated details 
glass exteriors allow passersby to see easily into the store from the high visibility  high traffic locations in the malls where we have located most of our stores 
the open floor design allows customers to readily view the majority of the merchandise on display while store fixtures allow for the efficient display of accessories 
our customers use cash  checks and third party credit cards to purchase our products 
we do not issue private credit cards or make use of complicated financing arrangements

table of contents store concepts 
as of february   we operated stores including wild pair stores 
as of april   we operated stores including wild pair stores 
our bakers stores focus on widely accepted  mainstream fashion and provide a fun  high energy shopping environment geared toward young women between the ages of and our wild pair stores feature fashion forward merchandise for hip young women and men between the ages of and and reflect the attitude and lifestyle of this demographic niche 
the wild pair customer demands edgier  faster fashion that exists further towards the leading edge than does the typical bakers customer  which allows us to better monitor the direction of the fashion forward look that our bakers customer will be seeking 
to match the attitude of our wild pair merchandise  we have created a fast  fun  edgy environment within our wild pair stores 
wild pair stores carry a higher proportion of branded merchandise  which generally sells at higher price points than our bakers footwear 
the following table compares our bakers and wild pair formats bakers wild pair target customer women ages men women ages private label sales branded sales fashion content widely accepted edgy  lifestyle based approximate average store size  square feet  square feet store operations 
our store operations are organized into four divisions  east  central  midwest  and west  which are subdivided into regions 
each region is managed by a regional manager  who is typically responsible for to stores 
each store is typically staffed with a manager and an assistant manager  in addition to approximately five sales associates 
in some markets where stores are more closely located  one of the store managers may also act as an area manager for the stores in that area  assisting the regional manager for those stores 
our regional managers are primarily responsible for the operation and results of the stores in their region  including the hiring or promotion of store managers 
we develop new store managers by promoting from within and selectively hiring from other retail organizations 
our store managers are primarily responsible for sales results  hiring and training store level staff  payroll control and shortage control 
merchandise selections  inventory management and visual merchandising strategies for each store are largely determined at the corporate level and are communicated by email to the stores generally on a weekly basis 
our commitment to customer satisfaction and service is an integral part of building customer loyalty 
we seek to instill enthusiasm and dedication in our store management personnel and sales associates through incentive programs and regular communication with the stores 
sales associates receive commissions on sales with a guaranteed minimum hourly compensation 
we run various sales contests to encourage our sales associates to maximize sales volume 
store managers receive base compensation plus incentive compensation based on sales and inventory control 
regional and area managers receive base compensation plus incentive compensation based on meeting profitability benchmarks 
each of our managers controls the payroll hours in conjunction with a weekly budget provided by the regional manager 
we have well established store operating policies and procedures and use an in store training regimen for all store employees 
on a regular basis  our merchandising staff provide the stores with merchandise presentation instructions  which include diagrams and photographs of fixture presentations 
in addition  our internal newsletter provides product descriptions  sales histories and other milestone information to sales associates to enable them to gain familiarity with our product offerings and our business 
we offer our sales associates a discount on our merchandise to encourage them to wear our merchandise and to reflect our lifestyle image both on and off the selling floor 

table of contents our regional managers are responsible for maintaining a loss prevention program in each of our stores 
in addition we have a loss prevention department with regional loss prevention staff who perform individual store visits throughout the year 
our loss prevention efforts also include monitoring returns  voided transactions  employee sales and deposits  using software to analyze transactions recorded in our point of sale system  as well as educating our store personnel on loss prevention 
we track inventory through electronic receipt acknowledgment to better monitor loss prevention factors  which allows us to identify variances and further to reduce our losses due to damage  theft or other reasons 
sourcing and distribution a key factor in our ability to offer our merchandise at moderate prices and respond quickly to changes in consumer trends is our sourcing proficiency 
we source each of our private label product lines separately based on the individual design  styling and quality specifications of those products 
we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and rely primarily on third party foreign manufacturers in china  brazil  italy  spain and other countries for the production of our private label merchandise 
our buying agents have long term relationships with these manufacturers and have been successful in minimizing the lead times for sourcing merchandise 
these relationships have allowed us to work very close to our expected delivery dates  reducing our markdown risk 
in addition  our test and react strategy supported by these strong relationships with manufacturers allows our merchandising and buying teams to test new styles and react quickly to fashion trends  while keeping fast moving inventory in stock 
for more information about risks associated with the foreign sourcing of our products  you should refer to risk factors our merchandise is manufactured by foreign manufacturers  therefore  the availability and costs of our products may be negatively affected by risks associated with international trade and risk factors our reliance on manufacturers in china exposes us to supply risks 
we believe that this sourcing of footwear products and our short lead times minimize our working capital investment and inventory risk  and enable efficient and timely introduction of new product designs 
we have not entered into any long term manufacturing or supply contracts 
we believe that a sufficient number of alternative sources exist for the manufacture of our products 
the principal materials used in the manufacture of our footwear and accessory merchandise are available from numerous domestic and international sources 
management  or our agents  perform an array of quality control inspection procedures at stages in the production process  including examination and testing of prototypes of key products prior to manufacture  samples and materials prior to production and final products prior to shipment 
substantially all merchandise for our stores is initially received  inspected  processed and distributed through one of our two distribution centers  each of which is part of a third party warehousing system 
merchandise that is manufactured in asia is delivered to our west coast distribution center located in los angeles  california and merchandise manufactured elsewhere in the world is delivered to our east coast distribution center located near philadelphia  pennsylvania 
in accordance with our micro merchandising strategy  our allocation teams determine how the product should be distributed among the stores based on current inventory levels  sales trends  specific product characteristics and the buyers input 
merchandise typically is shipped to the stores as soon as possible after receipt in our distribution centers using third party carriers  and any goods not shipped to stores are shipped to our warehouse facility in st 
louis  missouri for replenishment purposes 
we also fulfill our internet store and catalog sales from our st 
louis facility 
information systems and technology our information systems integrate our individual stores  merchandising  distribution and financial systems 
daily sales and cash deposit information is electronically collected from the stores point of sale terminals nightly 
this allows management to make timely decisions in response to market conditions 
these include decisions about pricing  markdowns  reorders and inventory management 
our arthur allocation and marketmax assortment planning systems in conjunction with our point of sale systems allow us to better execute our micro merchandising strategy through efficient management and allocation of our store inventories 
these systems allow us to reduce our response times in reaction to fashion trends and allow us to identify and reduce our losses due to damage  theft or other reasons  and to improve monitoring of employee 
table of contents productivity 
our micro merchandising strategy requires us to adapt the merchandise mix by location  with different assortments depending on store level customer demographics 
we have the capability to constantly monitor inventory levels and purchases by store  enabling us to manage our merchandise mix 
we believe that effective use of our systems allow us to manage our exposure to markdowns  resulting in higher gross margins 
we believe that our systems facilitate the process of controlling inventory commitments in light of changes in consumer demand 
we believe that our buyers and inventory management team are able to efficiently adjust our store inventory levels to effectively control excess inventory and markdowns 
marketing and advertising in fiscal year  we initiated our bakers catalog 
we believe that in addition to sales generated directly by the catalog  our store traffic and sales at our internet store have increased as a result of our increased visibility resulting from catalog distribution 
our marketing also includes an in store  high impact  visual advertising campaign 
marketing materials are particularly positioned to exploit our high visibility  high traffic mall locations 
banners in our windows and signage on our walls and tables may highlight a particular fashion story  a seasonal theme or a featured piece of merchandise 
we utilize promotional giveaways or promotional event marketing 
every three weeks  we provide the stores with specific merchandise display directions from the corporate office 
our in store product presentation utilizes a variety of different fixtures to highlight the breadth of our product line 
various fashion themes are displayed throughout the store utilizing combinations of styles and colors 
to cultivate brand loyalty  we offer our frequent buying card  the b card 
this program currently allows our customers to purchase a b card for and receive a discount on most purchases for a twelve month period 
we believe that this program has improved customer loyalty 
we also market to customers who have provided us with their e mail addresses via web bursts  e mail messages from bakers announcing new product offerings and promotions 
competition we believe that our bakers stores have no direct national competitors who specialize in full service  moderate priced fashion footwear for young women 
yet  the footwear and accessories retail industry is highly competitive and characterized by low barriers to entry 
competitive factors in our industry include brand name recognition  product styling  product quality  product presentation  product pricing  store ambiance  customer service  and convenience 
we believe that we match or surpass our competitors on the competitive factors that matter most to our target customer 
we offer the convenience of being located in high traffic  high visibility locations within the shopping malls in which our customer prefers to shop 
we have a focused strategy on our target customer that offers her the fun store atmosphere  full service and style that she desires 
several types of competitors vie for our target customer department stores such as bloomingdale s  macy s  dillard s and kohl s  national branded wholesalers such as nine west  steve madden and vans  national branded off price retailers such as dsw  rack room and shoe carnival  national specialty retailers such as finish line  journey s  naturalizer and aldo s  regional chains such as cathy jean and sheik  discount stores such as wal mart  target and k mart  and  to a lesser extent  apparel retailers such as bebe  charlotte russe  rampage and wet seal 

table of contents department stores generally are not located within the interior of the mall where our target customer prefers to shop with her friends 
national branded wholesalers generally have a narrower line of footwear with higher average price points and target a more narrowly focused customer 
specialty retailers also cater to a different demographic than our target customer 
regional chains generally do not offer the depth of private label merchandise that we offer 
national branded off price retailers and discount stores do not provide the same level of fashion or customer service 
apparel retailers  if they sell shoes or accessories  generally offer a narrow line of styles  which can encourage a customer to come to our store to purchase shoes or accessories to complement her new outfit 
our competitors sell a broad assortment of footwear and accessories that are similar and sometimes identical to those we sell  and at times may be able to provide comparable merchandise at lower prices 
while each of these different distribution channels may be able to compete with us on fashion  value or service  we believe that none of them can successfully match or surpass us on all three of these elements 
our wild pair stores compete on most of the same factors as bakers 
however  due to wild pair s market position  it is subject to more intense competition from national specialty retailers and national branded wholesalers 
history of bakers shoe stores the first bakers shoe store opened in atlanta  georgia  in bakers grew to be one of the nation s largest women s moderately priced specialty fashion footwear retailers 
at its peak in  bakers had grown to approximately stores 
at that time  it was one of several footwear  apparel and entertainment retail specialty chains that were owned and operated by edison brothers  which in had over  stores in the united states  puerto rico  the virgin islands  mexico and canada 
edison brothers filed a petition for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code on november  after an unsuccessful reorganization  edison brothers refiled for bankruptcy on march   and immediately commenced a liquidation of all its assets 
in june  we purchased selected assets of the bakers and wild pair chains  approximately store locations and inventory  from edison brothers stores  inc we retained the majority of bakers employees and key senior management  merchandise buyers  store operating personnel and administrative support personnel 
subsequently  we closed or re merchandised our prior stores into the bakers or wild pair formats 
employees as of april   we employed approximately full time and  part time employees with approximately of our employees at our corporate offices and warehouse  and  employees at our store locations 
the number of part time employees fluctuates depending on our seasonal needs 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union  and we believe our relationship with our employees is good 
properties all of our stores are located in the united states 
we lease all of our store locations 
most of our leases have an initial term of approximately ten years 
in addition  leases typically require us to pay property taxes  utilities  repairs  maintenance  common area maintenance and  in some instances  merchant association fees 
some of our leases also require contingent rent based on sales 
we lease approximately  square feet for our headquarters  located at scott avenue  st 
louis  missouri the lease has approximately ten years remaining 
we also lease an approximately  square foot warehouse in st 
louis with a remaining lease term of approximately nine years 
intellectual property and proprietary rights we acquired the right and title to several trademarks in connection with the bakers acquisition  including our trademarks bakers tm and wild pair 
in addition  we currently have several applications pending with the united states patent and trademark office for additional registrations 
for more information on our trademarks  please see risk factors our ability to expand into some territorial and foreign jurisdictions under the trademarks bakers and wild pair is restricted and risk factors our potential inability or failure to renew  register or otherwise protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names below 

table of contents seasonality our business is highly seasonal 
we have five principal selling seasons transition post holiday  easter  back to school  fall and holiday 
our fourth quarter sales volume tends to be significantly higher than our other quarters because our product offering during the holiday season tends to include our higher price point merchandise such as boots and customer traffic tends to be substantially higher during the holiday season 
consequently  we achieve our greatest leverage on fixed expenses and can generate our highest profit levels during the fourth quarter 
we have two of our five clearance sales during the third quarter and  consequently  we achieve our least leverage on fixed expenses and generate our lowest profit levels during the third quarter 
our working capital requirements fluctuate during the year  increasing prior to peak shopping seasons as we increase inventory levels to meet anticipated peak demand 
you should also refer to risk factors our overall profitability is highly dependent upon our fourth quarter results  risk factors our operations and expansion plans could be constrained by our ability to obtain funds under the terms of our revolving credit facility and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality and quarterly fluctuations

the following risks  uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results  performances or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by our forward looking statements our ability to identify and respond to changing consumer fashion preferences  our susceptibility to operating losses  our inability to expand as planned including our failure to integrate a significant number of new stores  the risk factors described below  our expectations regarding future financial results or performance contained in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the execution of our business strategy  the market opportunity for our services and products  the accuracy of our estimates regarding our capital requirements and needs for additional financing  any of our other plans  objectives  expectations and intentions contained in this form k that are not historical facts  and changes in general economic and business conditions 

table of contents risk factors our failure to identify and respond to changing consumer fashion preferences in a timely manner would negatively impact our sales  profitability and our image as a fashion resource for our customers 
the footwear industry is subject to rapidly changing consumer fashion preferences 
our sales and net income are sensitive to these changing preferences  which can be rapid and dramatic 
accordingly  we must identify and interpret fashion trends and respond in a timely manner 
we continually market new styles of footwear  but demand for and market acceptance of these new styles are uncertain 
our failure to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changes in consumer fashion preferences may result in lower sales  higher markdowns to reduce excess inventories and lower gross profits 
conversely  if we fail to anticipate consumer demand for our products  we may experience inventory shortages  which would result in lost sales and could negatively impact our customer goodwill  our brand image and our profitability 
moreover  our business relies on continuous changes in fashion preferences 
stagnating consumer preferences could also result in lower sales and would require us to take higher markdowns to reduce excess inventories 
for example  in fiscal year  changes in consumer fashion trends  primarily a decline in demand for sandals in the spring and for boots and booties in the fall  negatively impacted sales and profitability 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our operations and expansion plans could be constrained by our ability to obtain funds under the terms of our revolving credit facility 
our business is seasonal  with a substantial portion of our profitability and cash flow occurring during our fourth quarter 
we rely on draws from our revolving credit facility to fund seasonal working capital requirements  including capital expenditures during the first three quarters of our year 
draws on our credit facility are limited by both an overall limit of million and also by a calculated borrowing base that varies according to a formula based on inventory and accounts receivable and is generally less than the million overall limit 
as a result of our net loss in fiscal year and the level of our capital expenditures in fiscal year  as of february   we had an outstanding balance on our credit facility of million and unused borrowing capacity  calculated in accordance with the agreement  of million 
as of april   we had an outstanding balance of million and unused borrowing capacity of million 
to the extent we were to fail to generate sufficient cash from operating activities or from other financing activities  we could encounter availability constraints related to our expansion plans or  in extreme situations  related to our operating activities 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financing activities 
our growth strategy relies on the continued addition of new stores  which could strain our resources and cause the performance of our existing stores to suffer 
our growth will largely depend on our ability to open and operate new stores successfully 
we opened new stores in fiscal year we currently expect to open to new stores in fiscal year the successful integration of these new stores and customer acceptance of our new store format may have a material effect on our business 
prior to our initial public offering  a large portion of our growth primarily related to acquisitions 
we expect a large portion of our future growth to occur through the development of new stores 
our expansion will place increased demands on our operational  managerial and administrative resources 
these increased demands could cause us to operate our business less effectively  which in turn could cause deterioration in the financial performance of our business 
in addition  as we open new stores  we may be unable to hire a sufficient number of qualified store personnel or successfully integrate the new stores into our business 
if we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy  the opening of new stores  in new or current markets  could be delayed or prevented  could cost more than we have anticipated and could divert resources from other areas of our business  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our sales and earnings growth 
other factors that could affect the success of our growth strategy include availability of sufficient capital resources  identifying suitable markets and sites for new store locations  
table of contents negotiating acceptable lease terms  acceptance of store formats and product offerings in different locations  and managing inventory effectively to meet the needs of new and existing stores on a timely basis 
our overall profitability is highly dependent upon our fourth quarter results our fourth quarter sales volume tends to be significantly higher than our other quarters because our product offering during the holiday season tends to include our higher price point merchandise such as boots and customer traffic tends to be substantially higher during the holiday season 
consequently  we achieve our greatest leverage on fixed expenses and can generate our highest profit levels during the fourth quarter 
should our product offerings not meet with customer acceptance during the fourth quarter  it would have a substantial negative impact on the overall results for the year 
for example  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we had a million decrease in net income compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the largest decrease of any quarter of the year 
a decline in general economic conditions could lead to reduced consumer demand for our footwear and accessories and could lead to reduced sales and a delay in our expansion plans 
in addition to consumer fashion preferences  consumer spending habits are affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions  levels of employment  salaries and wage rates  consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions 
a general slowdown in the united states economy or an uncertain economic outlook would adversely affect consumer spending habits  which would likely cause us to delay or slow our expansion plans and result in lower net sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis 
we are susceptible to operating losses which would adversely affect our business and an investment in our common stock 
from time to time  we have had and in the future we could have operating losses because of fashion preferences  general economic conditions and other factors 
for example  for fiscal year  we incurred a net loss of million and an operating loss of million 
we have also incurred losses in other recent periods 
such losses in future periods could adversely affect our business and an investment in our common stock 
fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations could cause the price of our common stock to decline substantially 
in addition to customer shopping patterns  our quarterly results are affected by a variety of other factors  including fashion trends  the effectiveness of our inventory management  changes in our merchandise mix  weather conditions  changes in general economic conditions  and actions of competitors  mall anchor stores or co tenants 
due to factors such as these  our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future 
for example  net income for each of the four quarters of fiscal year was substantially less than for the comparable quarters of fiscal year and the closing price of our common stock decreased from on the last trading day of fiscal year to on the last trading day of fiscal year if our future quarterly results fail to meet the expectations of research analysts  then the market price of our common stock could decline substantially 
for more information  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 

table of contents our market share may be adversely impacted at any time by a significant number of competitors 
we operate in a highly competitive environment characterized by low barriers to entry 
we compete against a diverse group of competitors  including national branded wholesalers  national specialty retailers  regional chains  national branded off price retailers  traditional department stores  discounters and apparel retailers 
many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do 
our market share and results of operations could be adversely impacted by this significant number of competitors or the introduction of new competitors 
for more information about our competition  please see business competition 
the departure of members of our senior management team could adversely affect our business 
the success of our business depends upon our senior management closely supervising all aspects of our business  in particular  the operation of our stores and the design  procurement and allocation of our merchandise 
retention of senior management is especially important in our business due to the limited availability of experienced and talented retail executives 
if we were to lose the services of peter edison  our chairman and chief executive officer  or michele bergerac  our president  or other members of our senior management  our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to employ a suitable replacement in a timely manner 
our failure to maintain good relationships with our manufacturers could harm our ability to procure quality inventory in a timely manner 
our ability to obtain attractive pricing  quick response  ordering flexibility and other terms from our manufacturers depends on their perception of us and our buying agents 
we do not own any production facilities or have any long term contracts with any manufacturers  and we typically order our inventory through purchase orders 
any disruption in our supply chain could quickly impact our sales 
our failure or the failure of our buying agents to maintain good relationships with these manufacturers could increase our exposure to changing fashion cycles  which may lead to increased inventory markdown rates 
it is possible that we could be unable to acquire sufficient quantities or an appropriate mix of merchandise or raw materials at acceptable prices 
furthermore  we have received in the past  and may receive in the future  shipments of products from manufacturers that fail to conform to our quality control standards 
in this event  unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner  we may lose sales 
we are also subject to risks related to the availability and use of materials and manufacturing processes for our products  including those which some may find objectionable 
we rely on a small number of buying agents and private label vendors for a substantial portion our merchandise purchases  and our failure to maintain good relationships with any of them could harm our ability to source our products 
for fiscal year  five buying agents private label vendors accounted for approximately of our merchandise purchases  with one private label vendor accounting for approximately of our merchandise purchases 
our buying agents and private label vendors assist in developing our private label merchandise  arrange for the purchase of necessary materials and contract with manufacturers 
we execute nonexclusive agreements with some of our buying agents 
these agreements prohibit our buying agents from sharing commissions with manufacturers  owning stock or holding any ownership interest in  or being owned in any way by  any of our manufacturers or suppliers 
the agreements do not prohibit our buying agents from acting as agents for other purchasers  which could negatively impact our sales 
if they were to disclose our plans or designs to our competitors  our sales may be materially adversely impacted 
the loss of any of these key buying agents or a breach by them of our buying agent agreements could adversely affect our ability to develop or obtain merchandise 
our merchandise is manufactured by foreign manufacturers  therefore  the availability and costs of our products may be negatively affected by risks associated with international trade 
although all of our stores are located in the united states  virtually all of our merchandise is produced in china  brazil  italy  spain and other foreign countries 
therefore  we are subject to the risks associated with international trade  which include adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates  
table of contents changes in import tariffs  duties or quotas  the imposition of taxes or other charges on imports  the imposition of restrictive trade policies or sanctions by the united states on one or more of the countries from which we obtain footwear and accessories  expropriation or nationalization  compliance with and changes in import restrictions and regulations  exposure to different legal standards and the burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws and changing foreign government policies  international hostilities  war or terrorism  changes in foreign governments  regulations  political unrest  work stoppages  shipment disruption or delays  and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our manufacturers and suppliers are located 
in addition  our imported products are subject to united states customs duties  which make up a material portion of the cost of the merchandise 
if customs duties are substantially increased  it would harm our profitability 
the united states and the countries in which our products are produced may impose new quotas  duties  tariffs  or other restrictions  or adversely adjust prevailing quota  duty  or tariff levels  any of which could have a harmful effect on our profitability 
furthermore  when declaring the duties owed on and the classifications of our imported products  we make various good faith assumptions 
we regularly employ a third party to review our customs declarations  and we will notify the appropriate authorities if any erroneous declarations are revealed 
however  the customs authorities retain the right to audit our declarations  which could result in additional tariffs  duties and or penalties if the authorities believe that they have discovered any errors 
our reliance on manufacturers in china exposes us to supply risks 
manufacturing facilities in china produce a significant portion of our products 
generally  a substantial majority of our private label footwear units are manufactured in china and virtually all of our private label accessories are manufactured in china each year 
the chinese economy is subject to periodic energy and labor shortages  as well as transportation and shipping bottlenecks 
in prior years  there have been delays at ports on the west coast of the united states 
these matters  changes in the chinese government or economy  or the current tariff or duty structures or adoption by the united states of trade polices or sanctions adverse to china  could harm our ability to obtain inventory in a timely and cost effective manner 
our ability to expand into some territorial and foreign jurisdictions under the trademarks bakers and wild pair is restricted 
when we acquired selected assets of the bakers and wild pair chains from edison brothers stores  inc in a bankruptcy auction in june  we were assigned title to and the right to use the trademarks bakers  the wild pair  wild pair and other trademarks to the extent owned by edison brothers at that time 
our rights to use the trademarks are subject to a concurrent use agreement which recognizes the geographical division of the trademarks between us and a puerto rican company 
at approximately the same time as we acquired our rights and title  edison brothers also assigned to the puerto rican company title to and the right to use the trademarks  subject to the concurrent use agreement 
under the concurrent use agreement  we and the puerto rican company agree that the puerto rican company has the exclusive right to use the trademarks in the commonwealth of puerto rico  the us virgin islands  central and south america  cuba  the dominican republic  the bahamas  the lesser antilles and jamaica and that we have the exclusive right to use the trademarks in the united states and throughout the world  except for the territories and jurisdictions in which the puerto rican company was assigned the rights 
consequently  we do not have the right to use the trademarks bakers and wild pair in those territories and foreign jurisdictions in which the puerto rican company owns the trademark rights  which may limit our growth 

table of contents our potential inability or failure to renew  register or otherwise protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names 
because the trademarks assigned to us by edison brothers are subject to the concurrent use agreement  the us trademark applications and registrations are jointly owned by us and a puerto rican company  which could impair our ability to renew and enforce the assigned applications and registrations 
simultaneously with the puerto rican company  we have filed separate concurrent use applications for the bakers and wild pair trademarks  and we have requested that existing applications for the trademark bakers also be divided territorially 
while we are in agreement with the puerto rican company that confusion is not likely to result from concurrent use of the trademarks in our respective territories  the united states patent and trademark office may not agree with our position 
if we are not able to register or renew our trademark registrations  our ability to prevent others from using trademarks and to capitalize on the value of our brand names may be impaired 
further  our rights in the trademarks could be subject to security interests granted by the puerto rican company 
our potential inability or failure to renew  register or otherwise protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights could negatively impact the value of our brand names 
we would be adversely affected if our distribution operations were disrupted 
the efficient operation of our stores is dependent on our ability to distribute merchandise manufactured overseas to locations throughout the united states in a timely manner 
we depend on third parties to ship  receive and distribute substantially all of our merchandise 
a third party operating in china manages the shipping of merchandise from china either to a third party operating our los angeles  california distribution center or for delivery directly to our stores through los angeles 
the third party in los angeles  california accepts delivery of a significant portion of our merchandise from asia  and another third party near philadelphia  pennsylvania accepts delivery of our merchandise from elsewhere 
these parties located in the united states have provided these services to us pursuant to written agreements since and one of these agreements is terminable upon days notice 
we also continue to operate under the terms of an expired agreement with the remaining third party 
merchandise not shipped to our stores is shipped to our company operated warehouse 
we also rely on our computer network to coordinate the distribution of our products 
if we need to replace one of our third party service providers  if our warehouse or computer network is shut down for any reason or does not operate efficiently  our operations could be disrupted for a substantial period of time while we identify and integrate a replacement into our system 
any such disruption could materially negatively impact our ability to maintain sufficient inventory in our stores and consequently our profitability 
we may be subject to liability under our registration statements 
we currently have three registration statements relating to our incentive plans and two selling shareholder registration statements in effect  including a registration statement relating to the common stock sold and common stock underlying the warrants issued in our april private placement and the common stock underlying the warrants issued in our initial public offering 
in connection with that private placement  the registration rights agreement may subject us to liquidated damages penalties through april  equal to of the aggregate purchase price for each day period or pro rata for any portion thereof in excess of our allotted time if any required registration statement is not filed or effective within the required time  or if after effectiveness sales cannot be made pursuant to the registration statement generally for any reason  including our failure to maintain the registration statement  subject to our right to suspend use of the registration statement for certain periods of time in certain circumstances 
we are subject to risks associated with leasing our stores  including those stores where we acquired the lease through bankruptcy auctions 
we lease our store locations under individual leases 
approximately one half of our stores are located in properties managed by two national property management companies 
we initially acquired many of our current leases from edison brothers  as debtor in possession  or from other bankrupt entities through auctions in which a bankruptcy court ordered the assignment of the debtor s interest in the leases to us 
as a result  we have not separately negotiated many of our leases  which are generally drafted in favor of the landlord 

table of contents a number of our leases include termination and default provisions which apply if we do not meet certain sales levels  specified dilution in or changes of ownership of our company occur  or in other circumstances 
in addition  our leases subject us to risks relating to compliance with changing mall rules and the exercise of discretion by our landlords on various matters 
moreover  each year a significant portion of our leases are subject to renewal or termination 
if one or more of our landlords decides to terminate our leases  or to not allow us to renew  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
our credit facility restricts our activities 
we have a million secured revolving credit facility with bank of america  na we routinely depend on our credit facility and may use a large percentage of the facility to fund our inventory purchases and our capital expenditures  especially prior to our selling seasons 
our credit facility includes financial and other customary covenants which  among other things  restrict our business activities and our ability to incur debt  make acquisitions and pay dividends 
a change in control of our company  including any person or group acquiring beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock or our combined voting power as defined in the credit facility  is also prohibited 
in the event that we were to violate any of the covenants in our credit facility  or if other indebtedness in excess of million could be accelerated  or in the event that or more of our leases could be terminated other than solely as a result of certain sales of our common stock  the lender would have the right to accelerate repayment of all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement  or to commence foreclosure proceedings on our assets 
effective august   we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement which  among other things  extended its maturity date to august  for more information about our credit facility  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the market price of our common stock may be materially adversely affected by market volatility 
the market price of our common stock is expected to be highly volatile  both because of actual and perceived changes in our financial results and prospects and because of general volatility in the stock market 
the factors that could cause fluctuations in our stock price may include  among other factors discussed in this section  the following actual or anticipated variations in comparable store sales or operating results  changes in financial estimates by research analysts  actual or anticipated changes in the united states economy or the retailing environment  changes in the market valuations of other footwear or retail companies  and announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  divestitures  joint ventures  financing transactions  securities offerings or other strategic initiatives 
we are controlled by a small group of shareholders whose interests may differ from other shareholders 
affiliates of peter edison and members of his family and our current management are among our largest shareholders 
accordingly  they will continue to have significant influence in determining the outcome of all matters submitted to shareholders for approval  including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions 
the interests of these shareholders may differ from the interests of other shareholders  and their concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control that may be favored by other shareholders 
as long as these people are among our principal shareholders  they will have the power to significantly influence the election of our entire board of directors 
peter edison s employment agreement entitles him to a one time payment equal to three times his current base salary as defined in the agreement upon the occurrence of certain events  including following a change of control of the company if there is generally a material reduction in the nature of his duties or his base salary  or he is not allowed to participate in certain bonus plans 
for this purpose  a change of control generally includes the acquisition by a person or group of more of our common stock than that held by peter edison 
two of our shareholders have filed a schedule g reporting beneficial 
table of contents ownership in an amount in excess of that beneficially owned by mr 
edison 
in addition  a significant portion of our stock ownership is also concentrated among a relatively small number of mutual funds and hedge funds whose interests may differ from our other shareholders or could impact our company including any potential change of control 
the public sale of our common stock by selling shareholders could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of market sales by our shareholders  including under our two resale registration statements  or the perception that these sales will occur 
these sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 
there is relatively limited trading in our common stock 
the trading volume of our common stock is relatively limited  which we expect to continue 
therefore  our stock may be subject to higher volatility or illiquidity than would exist if our shares were traded more actively 
our charter documents and missouri law may inhibit a takeover  which may cause a decline in the value of our stock 
provisions of our restated articles of incorporation  our restated bylaws and missouri law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if closing the transaction would be beneficial to our shareholders 
for example  our restated articles of incorporation provide  in part  that directors may be removed from office by our shareholders only for cause and by the affirmative vote of not less than two thirds of our outstanding shares and that vacancies may be filled only by a majority of remaining directors 
under our restated bylaws  shareholders must follow detailed notice and other requirements to nominate a candidate for director or to make shareholder proposals 
in addition  among other requirements  our restated bylaws require at least a two thirds vote of shareholders to call a special meeting 
moreover  missouri law and our bylaws provide that any action by written consent must be unanimous 
furthermore  our bylaws may be amended only by our board of directors 
certain amendments to our articles of incorporation require the vote of two thirds of our outstanding shares in certain circumstances  including the provisions of our articles of incorporation relating to business combinations  directors  bylaws  limitations on director liabilities and amendments to our articles of incorporation 
we are also generally subject to the business combination provisions under missouri law  which allow our board of directors to retain discretion over the approval of certain business combinations 
in our bylaws  we have elected to not be subject to the control shares acquisition provision under missouri law  which would deny an acquiror voting rights with respect to any shares of voting stock which increase its equity ownership to more than specified thresholds 
these and other provisions of missouri law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws  peter edison s substantial beneficial ownership position  our board s authority to issue preferred stock and the lack of cumulative voting in our articles of incorporation may have the effect of making it more difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our board or otherwise to bring a matter before shareholders without our board s consent 
such items may reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited takeover proposal and may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control  may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over its market price and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock

table of contents represents the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and recognizing as income the unamortized deferred credit related to the excess of fair value over cost arising from the acquisition of our bakers and wild pair store locations in through january   we elected s corporation status for federal and state income tax purposes 
accordingly  for periods through january   no provision was made for federal or certain state income taxes 
pro forma net income has been computed as if we had been fully subject to federal  state and local income taxes 
effective january   we terminated our s election and became taxable as a c corporation 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we have reflected the net impact of the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities as of the date of conversion as a component of our provision for income taxes for fiscal year this resulted in the recognition of a nonrecurring income tax benefit of approximately million

on february   we consummated our initial public offering with the sale of  shares of common stock 
on march   we sold an additional  shares of common stock in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of the full over allotment option 
all of the shares of common stock sold to the public were sold at per share 
the aggregate gross proceeds from the initial public offering were approximately million 
the net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately million 
we used the net proceeds received from the initial public offering to repay million on our revolving credit agreement  million to redeem outstanding warrants  million to repay subordinated debt and million for capital expenditures 
immediately prior to our initial public offering  we had three classes of common stock authorized  class a common stock  class b common stock and class c common stock  of which only shares of class a and class b common stock were outstanding 
upon the consummation of our initial public offering  shares of class a common stock and  shares of class b common stock automatically converted into an aggregate of  shares of common stock on a for basis  excluding fractional shares 
mandatory redemption rights in favor of certain holders of prior class a and class b common stock were also terminated 
in addition  upon the consummation of our initial public offering  million in aggregate principal amount of our subordinated convertible debentures due were automatically converted into  shares of our common stock

see note in the notes to the financial statements 
on march   we changed our fiscal year to the saturday closest to january previously our fiscal year ended four weeks earlier 
as a result of this change  we had a four week transition period ended january  the audited results of operations and changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for the four week transition period are included in our financial statements and notes thereto 
we believe that the change in our fiscal year end does not impact the comparability of the five fiscal years presented in this table

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item business cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors and item business risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
the following section is qualified in its entirety by this more detailed information and our financial statements and the related notes thereto  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a national  mall based  specialty retailer of distinctive footwear and accessories targeting young women who demand quality fashion products 
we feature private label and national brand dress  casual and sport shoes  boots  sandals and accessories 
as of february   we operated stores  including the store wild pair chain that targets men and women between the ages of and who desire edgier  fashion forward footwear 
as of april  we operated stores  including wild pair stores 
we operate on a week fiscal year 
fiscal year was a week period and fiscal years and were week periods 
we believe that the fifty third week of fiscal year does not materially effect the comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year in our discussion and analysis of results of operations 
on march   we changed our fiscal year end to the saturday closest to january previously  our fiscal year ended four weeks earlier 
this change moves us to the standard retail calendar and matches our financial year to our merchandising year 
as a result of this change  we had a four week transition period ended january  we believe that the fiscal year ended january  provides a meaningful comparison to the fiscal year ended january  and thus use these two audited fiscal years for comparison purposes in our discussion and analysis of results of operations 
for comparison purposes  we classify our stores as comparable or non comparable 
a new store s sales are not included in comparable store sales until the thirteenth month of operation 
sales from remodeled stores are excluded from comparable store sales during the period of remodeling 
we include our internet and catalog sales as one store in calculating our comparable store sales 
comparable store sales for fiscal year compare the fifty three week period ended february  to the fifty three week period ended february  fiscal year was a difficult year  as demand for our spring sandals and our fall boots was disappointing  resulting in negative comparable store sales in each of our quarters 
for all of fiscal year  comparable store sales decreased  compared to the very strong comparable store increase of in fiscal year this 
table of contents weakness in demand also negatively impacted our gross margins  which decreased to of sales in fiscal year from of sales in fiscal year  as a result of greater promotional and markdown activity taken to maintain control of inventory levels 
furthermore  weak sales resulted in negative leverage on our selling expenses  which increased to of sales in fiscal year from in fiscal year consequently  we incurred a net loss of million in fiscal year compared to record net income of million in fiscal year weakness in sales trends has continued into fiscal year  with comparable store sales for the first two months down and weakness has increased in april against a later easter in fiscal year we have reacted to our fiscal year and fiscal year to date results by increasing our focus on inventory management and expense control 
at the end of fiscal year  total inventory was million  down from million at the end of fiscal year  despite operating net additional stores 
we have also adjusted our new store and store remodeling plans for fiscal year to to new stores and approximately nine remodeled stores 
we believe that this expansion rate can be funded by cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
we continue to focus on our bakers branding  through expansion of our catalog operations 
we initiated the catalog with four mailings of approximately  copies each in fiscal year and are planning five mailings of as many as  copies each for fiscal year in april  we completed a private placement of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  generating net proceeds of approximately million 
we used the proceeds to finance new store expansion and remodel existing stores into our new format 
during the first quarter of  we completed our initial public offering generating net proceeds of million  converted million of convertible debt and redeemable securities into common stock  and repaid million of debt obligations 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
these differences could be material to the financial statements 
for more information  please see note in the notes to the financial statements 
we believe that our application of accounting policies  and the estimates that are inherently required by these policies  are reasonable 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in first out retail inventory method 
permanent markdowns are recorded to reflect expected adjustments to retail prices in accordance with the retail inventory method 
the process of determining our expected adjustments to retail prices requires significant judgment by management 
among other factors  management utilizes performance metrics to evaluate the quality and freshness of inventory  including the number of weeks of supply on hand  sell through percentages and aging categories of inventory by selling season  to make its best estimate of the appropriate inventory markdowns 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory markdowns may be required 
store closing and impairment charges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable 
we regularly analyze the operating results of our stores and assess the viability of under performing stores to determine whether they should be closed or whether their associated assets  including furniture  fixtures  equipment  and leasehold improvements  have been impaired 
asset impairment tests are performed at least annually  on a store by store basis 
after allowing for an appropriate start up period  unusual 
table of contents nonrecurring events  and favorable trends  fixed assets of stores indicated to be impaired are written down to fair value 
during the year ended january   the four week transition period ended january  and the years ended january  and february   respectively  we recorded    and  respectively  in noncash charges to earnings related to the impairment of furniture  fixtures  and equipment  leasehold improvements and other assets 
stock based compensation expense on january   the beginning of fiscal year  we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas r which requires us to recognize compensation expense for stock based compensation based on the grant date fair value 
stock based compensation expense is then recognized ratably over the service period related to each grant 
we used the modified prospective transition method under which financial statements covering periods prior to adoption have not been restated 
we determine the fair value of stock based compensation using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires us to make assumptions regarding future dividends  expected volatility of our stock  and the expected lives of the options 
under sfas r we also make assumptions regarding the number of options and the number of shares of restricted stock and performance shares that will ultimately vest 
the assumptions and calculations required by sfas r are complex and require a high degree of judgment 
assumptions regarding the vesting of grants are accounting estimates that must be updated as necessary with any resulting change recognized as an increase or decrease in compensation expense at the time the estimate is changed 
prior to january   we followed apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for our stock options and the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas 
under apb opinion no 
 compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period based on the amount by which the fair value of the underlying common stock exceeds the exercise price of stock options at the date of grant 
adoption of the expensing requirements of sfas r will reduce the company s reported earnings in future periods 
the adoption of sfas r resulted in no significant change in the determination of stock based compensation expense compared to our previously disclosed pro forma stock based compensation expense determined using sfas during fiscal year  we made our initial grants of performance shares under our incentive compensation plan 
previously  all share based compensation was in the form of stock options 
based upon the degree of achievement of performance objectives for net sales and return on average assets through fiscal year  we will issue a total of between zero and  shares of common stock under these performance share grants 
we also granted  stock options during fiscal year we granted  stock options during the fiscal year as of february   the total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock based compensation is  and the weighted average period over which this compensation is expected to be recognized is years 
deferred income taxes we calculate income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax reporting purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
inherent in the measurement of deferred taxes are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to our operations 
no valuation allowance has been provided for the deferred tax assets because we generated taxable income in prior periods and we anticipate that future taxable income will be sufficient to allow us to fully realize the amount of net deferred tax assets 
through january   we were an s corporation under subchapter s of the internal revenue code and comparable state tax laws  and consequently were not subject to income taxes on our earnings in those jurisdictions  other than state franchise and net worth taxes 
however  we were subject to income taxes in some states which do 
table of contents not recognize s corporation status 
our s corporation status was terminated effective january  and  as a result  we became subject to federal and state income taxes as a c corporation

net income 
net income increased to million in fiscal year up from million in fiscal year four week transition period ended january  compared to four weeks ended january  in connection with the change in our fiscal year  we had a four week transition period from january  to january  the month of january is typically our lowest sales month and is also characterized by a low level of full price selling activity compared to the year as a whole 
as a result  january tends to be an unprofitable month and january results are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year 
the following is a brief analysis of the transition period ended january  compared to the unaudited four week period ended january  it should be noted that the four week period ended january  was prior to the consummation of our initial public offering 
during the four weeks ended january   we opened no stores  closed two stores and ended 
table of contents the period with stores 
during the four weeks ended january   we opened no stores  closed seven stores and ended the period with stores

net income loss 
we incurred a net loss of million in january compared to net income of million in january seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the following table sets forth our summary operating results for the quarterly periods indicated 
fiscal year ended january  thirteen thirteen thirteen thirteen weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended april  july  october  january  net sales gross profit operating expenses operating income loss fiscal year ended january  thirteen thirteen thirteen thirteen weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended april  july  october  january  net sales gross profit operating expenses operating income loss 
table of contents fiscal year ended february  thirteen thirteen thirteen fourteen weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended april  july  october  february  net sales gross profit operating expenses operating income loss in connection with the change in our fiscal year we had a four week transition period from january  through january  the summary operating results for our transition period were as follows net sales of  gross profit of  operating expenses of  and operating loss of  on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas r under which the company recognizes compensation expense for stock based compensation ratably over the service period related to each grant based on the grant date fair value 
the company used the modified prospective transition method under which financial statements covering periods prior to adoption have not been restated 
the impact of stock based compensation expense on operating income loss  is  for the thirteen weeks ended april    for the thirteen weeks ended july    for the thirteen weeks ended october   and  for the fourteen weeks ended february  the impact on the fourteen weeks ended february  reflects the reversal of  related to the change in the estimated vesting of performance shares issued in fiscal year our operating results are subject to significant seasonal variations 
our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated  and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future  as a result of these seasonal variances  in particular our principal selling seasons 
we have five principal selling seasons transition post holiday  easter  back to school  fall and holiday 
sales and operating results in our third quarter are typically much weaker than in our other quarters 
prior to changing our fiscal year  the easter holiday shifted between our first and second quarters influencing our quarterly comparable results 
in fiscal year  easter occurred during the second quarter 
with the change in our fiscal year in  easter will now always occur in our first quarter 
quarterly comparisons may also be affected by the timing of sales promotions and costs associated with remodeling stores  opening new stores or acquiring stores 
liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements are primarily for working capital  capital expenditures and principal payments on our capital lease obligations 
historically  these cash needs have been met by cash flows from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and sales of securities 
during fiscal year  we completed a private placement of common stock and warrants which generated net proceeds of approximately million and we generated million of operating cash flow 
these sources provided the cash to fund million of capital expenditures  and enabled us to end fiscal year with a cash balance of million and no amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility 
in contrast  in fiscal year  we did not have any placements of debt or equity  generated million of operating cash flow and relied primarily on draws from our revolving credit facility to fund million of capital expenditures  resulting in an outstanding balance of million on our revolving credit facility at february  as discussed below in financing activities  the balance on our revolving credit facility fluctuates throughout the year as a result of our seasonal working capital requirements and our other uses of cash 

table of contents the following table summarizes certain key liquidity measurements as of the dates indicated january  february  cash inventories total current assets revolving credit facility total current liabilities net working capital property and equipment  net total assets total shareholders equity unused borrowing capacity as calculated under the terms of our revolving credit facility we anticipate that our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient for our operating cash requirements for at least the next months and will allow us to further execute our business plan  including our current expansion plans as described in investing activities below 
operating activities as a result of the seasonality of our operations  we generate a significant proportion of our cash from operating activities during our fourth quarter 
for fiscal year through the end of our third quarter  cash used in operating activities was million compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the entire fiscal year 
for fiscal year through the end of the third quarter  cash provided by operating activities was million compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the entire fiscal year 
cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal year compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal year besides the million decrease in net income in fiscal year  the most significant use of cash in operating activities  which also accounts for the majority of the change in cash from operating activities compared to fiscal year  primarily relates to an million reduction of accounts payable  accrued expenses and accrued income taxes from the balances at the end of fiscal year compared to an million increase in these liabilities during fiscal year accrued employee compensation decreased million in fiscal year primarily as the result of the payment in the first quarter of of accrued incentive compensation related to fiscal year accrued income taxes decreased million in fiscal year primarily as the result of payment of income taxes relating to fiscal year other accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased million in fiscal year primarily as the result of lower inventory and construction in progress at the end of fiscal year as discussed below in financing activities  the reduction of accounts payable and accrued expenses in fiscal year was financed through increased borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
our inventories at february  decreased to million from million at january  we believe that at february   inventory levels and valuations are appropriate given current and anticipated sales trends  however  there is always the possibility that fashion trends could change suddenly 
we monitor our inventory levels closely and will take appropriate actions  including taking additional markdowns  as necessary  to maintain the freshness of our inventory 
for fiscal year  cash provided by operating activities was million compared to net cash provided by operations of million in fiscal year  an increase of million the primary components of this increase are a million increase in net income  a million increase in depreciation expense and a million increase in accrued rent 

table of contents we are committed under noncancelable operating leases for all store and office spaces 
these leases expire at various dates through and generally provide for minimum rent plus payments for real estate taxes and operating expenses  subject to escalations 
some of our leases also require us to pay contingent rent based on sales 
as of february   our lease payment obligations under these leases totaled million for fiscal year  and an aggregate of million through investing activities in fiscal year  cash used in investing activities was million compared to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year during each year  cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures for furniture  fixtures and leasehold improvements for both new and remodeled stores  and new information systems 
a substantial portion of the capital expenditures  million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year relate to construction in progress for new and remodeled stores to be opened during the spring of the following year 
our future capital expenditures will depend primarily on the number of new stores we open  the number of existing stores we remodel and the timing of these expenditures 
we continuously evaluate our future capital expenditure plans and adjust planned expenditures  as necessary  based on business conditions 
because we are able to identify locations  negotiate leases  and construct stores in a relatively short period of time  we are able to maintain considerable flexibility in the timing and extent of our capital expenditures  allowing us to exploit opportunities while maintaining prudent working capital and overall capitalization positions 
as of april   we have opened four new stores in fiscal year we currently plan to open a total of approximately to new stores in fiscal year capital expenditures for a new store typically range from  to over  we generally receive landlord allowances in connection with new stores ranging from  to  the average cash investment in inventory for a new store is expected to range from  to  depending on the size and sales expectation of the store and the timing of the new store opening 
pre opening expenses  such as marketing  salaries  supplies  rent and utilities are expensed as incurred 
remodeling the average existing store into the new format typically costs approximately  we remodeled stores during fiscal year as of april   we completed the remodeling of five stores in fiscal year we currently plan to remodel a total of approximately stores in fiscal year we currently project our capital expenditures in fiscal year to be approximately million 
we anticipate being able to fund this level of store expansion from internally generated cash flow and borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
we retain considerable latitude regarding our plans for the second half of and will make commitments commensurate with evolving business and economic conditions over the next twelve months 
financing activities in fiscal year  our net cash provided by financing activities was million compared to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year in fiscal year  this related primarily to draws on our revolving credit facility  in fiscal year  this related primarily to our private placement discussed below  and in fiscal year  this related primarily to our initial public offering  discussed below 
effective august   we amended our secured revolving credit facility with bank of america  na successor by merger to fleet retail finance inc to increase the revolving credit ceiling from million to million and to extend the maturity of the facility from august  to august  amounts borrowed under the facility bear interest at a rate equal to the base rate as defined in the agreement  which was per annum as of february  and as of january  following the occurrence of any event of default  the interest rate may be increased by an additional two percentage points 
the revolving credit agreement also allows us to apply an interest rate based on libor london interbank offered rate  as defined in the agreement plus a margin rate of to per annum to a designated portion of the outstanding balance as set forth in the agreement 
the aggregate amount that we may borrow under the agreement at any time is further limited by a formula  which is based substantially on our inventory level 
the agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets 
in connection with the administration of the agreement  we are required to pay a facility fee of  per month 
in addition  an unused line fee of per annum is payable monthly based on the difference between the 
table of contents revolving credit ceiling and the average loan balance under the agreement 
if contingencies related to early termination of the credit facility were to occur  or if we were to request and receive an accommodation from the lender in connection with the facility  we may be required to pay additional fees 
we had a balance under our credit facility of million and had approximately million in unused borrowing capacity calculated under the provisions of our credit facility as of february  during fiscal year  the highest outstanding balance on our credit facility was million 
we primarily have used the borrowings on our revolving credit facility for working capital purposes and capital expenditures 
as of april   we had an outstanding balance of million and approximately million of unused borrowing capacity  based on our borrowing base calculations 
because of this relatively low level of unused borrowing capacity  we requested and the bank agreed on april   to adjust the borrowing base calculation to provide for additional borrowing capacity of  for the period april  through may  to the extent that cash generated by operations does not result in increased levels of unused borrowing capacity  we may consider additional financing alternatives

our credit facility includes financial and other covenants relating to  among other things  use of funds under the facility in accordance with our business plan  prohibiting a change of control  including any person or group acquiring beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock or our combined voting power as defined in the credit facility  maintaining a minimum availability  prohibiting new debt  restricting dividends and the repurchase of our stock  and restricting certain acquisitions 
in the event that we were to violate any of these covenants  or if other indebtedness in excess of million could be accelerated  or in the event that or more of our leases could be terminated other than solely as a result of certain sales of our common stock  the lender would have the right to accelerate repayment of all amounts outstanding under the agreement  or to commence foreclosure proceedings on our assets 
as of february   we were in compliance with all of our financial and other covenants under the facility and expect to remain in compliance throughout fiscal year based on the expected execution of our business plan  which includes increasing our focus on inventory management and expense control 
on april   we sold  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  subject to anti dilution and other adjustments  to certain investors in a private placement for gross proceeds of  the warrants have an exercise price of per share and  subject to certain conditions  expire on april  we also issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of through april  to the placement agent 
in certain circumstances  a cashless exercise provision becomes operative for the warrants issued to the investors 
in the event that the closing bid price of a share of our stock equals or exceeds per share for consecutive trading days  we have the ability to call the warrants  effectively forcing their exercise into common stock 
the warrants issued to the placement agent generally have the same terms and conditions  except that the cashless exercise provision is more generally available and the warrants are not subject to a call provision

as of february   the maximum amount of liquidated damages that we could be required to pay was  which represents potential monthly payments of  we have not recorded a liability in connection with the registration rights agreement because  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we have concluded that it is not probable that we will make any payments under the liquidated damages provisions of the registration rights agreement 
we estimated the grant date fair value of the  stock purchase warrants  including the placement agent warrants  issued in connection with the private placement to be  using the black scholes formula assuming no dividends  a risk free interest rate of  expected volatility of  and expected warrant life of five years 
because the warrants were issued in connection with the sale of common stock and we have no obligation to settle the warrants by any means other than through the issuance of shares of our common stock we have included the fair value of the warrants as a component of shareholders equity 
as of february   the aggregate payments remaining on our capital lease obligations were approximately million through  including million due in fiscal year  compared to remaining aggregate payments of million as of january  initial public offering on february   we consummated our initial public offering with the sale of  shares of common stock

all of the shares of common stock sold to the public were sold at a price of per share 
the aggregate gross proceeds from the initial public offering were approximately million 
the net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately million 
we used all of the net proceeds received from the initial public offering in to repay million on our revolving credit agreement  million to redeem outstanding warrants  million to repay subordinated debt and million for capital expenditures 
pending use of the proceeds  we invested in short term  investment grade interest bearing instruments 
in connection with our initial public offering  million in principal amount of subordinated convertible debentures automatically converted into  shares of common stock at a fixed exercise price of per share 
our class a and class b common stock was converted into shares of our new common stock on a one to one basis  excluding fractional shares  and million of related redemption obligations were terminated 
we have registered the common stock issued in connection with the conversion of the subordinated convertible debentures 
in connection with our initial public offering  we sold to the representatives of the underwriters and their designees warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to per share  subject to antidilution adjustments  for a purchase price of per warrant for the warrants 
the warrant holders may exercise the warrants as to all or any lesser number of the underlying shares of common stock at any time during the four year period commencing on february  in addition  we are required for a five year period  i at the request of a majority of the warrant holders  to use our best efforts to file one registration statement  at our expense  covering the sale of the shares of common stock underlying the warrants and ii at the request of any holders of warrants  to file additional registration statements covering the shares of common stock underlying the warrants at the expense of those holders 
we are required to maintain the effectiveness of any demand registration statement for up to nine consecutive months 
except for the registration rights that we have granted to the prior holders of our subordinated convertible debentures  we generally agreed not to make any registered offering of our securities  with limited exceptions  or to include any other shares on any such demand registration statement  at any time that we are required to maintain the effectiveness of a demand registration statement  without first obtaining the consent of a majority of the holders of warrants and warrant shares that are not then held by the public or by us or other excepted persons who have a relationship with us and our affiliates

off balance sheet arrangements at february  and january   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we are  therefore  not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could otherwise have arisen if we had engaged in such relationships 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin requires  among other matters  that we recognize in our financial statements  the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin are effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year  with any cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we do not believe adopting fin will have a material impact on our financial statements 
impact of inflation overall  we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented 
we cannot give assurance  however  that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings and cash flows may be subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates 
our financing arrangements include both fixed and variable rate debt in which changes in interest rates will impact the fixed and variable rate debt differently 
a change in the interest rate of fixed rate debt will impact the fair value of the debt  whereas a change in the interest rate on the variable rate debt will impact interest expense and cash flows 
we had million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility at february  a hypothetical increase in interest rates of basis points would result in a potential reduction in future pre tax earnings of approximately million per year for every million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
management does not believe that the risk associated with changing interest rates would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition
