during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and the compensation paid to the drivers 
innovations in equipment technology and comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices  and there has been an industry wide increase in wages paid to attract and retain qualified drivers

fuel prices have remained high throughout   and  thus increasing our cost of operations

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company s management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the probable future resolution of the uncertainties increase  these judgments become even more subjective and complex 
the company has identified certain accounting policies  described below  that are the most important to the portrayal of the company s current financial condition and results of operations 
the most significant accounting policies and estimates that affect the financial statements include the following revenue is recognized when freight is delivered 
selections of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating tractors and trailers 
depreciable lives of tractors and trailers are and years  respectively 
estimates of salvage value are based upon the expected market values of equipment at the end of the expected useful life 
management estimates accruals for the self insured portion of pending accident liability  workers compensation  physical damage and cargo damage claims 
these accruals are based upon individual case estimates  including reserve development  and estimates of incurred but not reported losses based upon past experience 
management judgment is required to determine the provision for income taxes and to determine whether deferred income taxes will be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance is required to be established for the amount of deferred income tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets has not been established due to the profitability of the company s business 
management periodically re evaluates these estimates as events and circumstances change 
these factors may significantly impact the company s results of operations from period to period
