cafta  which was signed by the us on august   will allow the us duty free imports from guatemala if the fabric is manufactured using yarn from the us or a country party to cafta 
guatemala ratified cafta as of july  we anticipate that  over time  cafta may make guatemala more competitive with imports from the far east in the categories manufactured by us in guatemala  although we cannot assure you this will happen

the occurrence of certain of these factors may delay or prevent the delivery of goods ordered by customers  and such delay or inability to meet delivery requirements would have a severe adverse impact on our results of operations and could have an adverse effect on our relationships with our customers 
furthermore  the occurrence of certain of these factors in guatemala  where we own a manufacturing facility  could result in the loss of our remaining investment located in this country 
at january   based on an appraisal by an independent third party  we recorded a impairment charge against our equipment  furniture and fixtures at our guatemalan facility and established a salvage value  not subject to depreciation  for the building and building improvements in our guatemala facility 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to realize the salvage value recorded at  or that we may not incur additional losses due to severance and other obligations 

table of contents we currently operate a manufacturing facility in guatemala 
operating a manufacturing facility rather than contracting with independent manufacturers requires us to maintain a higher level of working capital 
in addition  reduced sales have an even greater adverse impact on our results because of the fixed costs needed to own and operate our own factory 
because our manufacturing operations are located outside the us  we are subject to many of the same risks as relying on foreign contract manufacturers 
see item properties 
raw materials in  we supplied the raw materials to our guatemalan manufacturing facility and to non affiliated guatemalan factories 
for all other production  the raw materials are purchased directly by the manufacturer in accordance with our specifications 
in both cases  raw materials  which are in most instances made  finished and colored specifically to our order  consist principally of fabric and trim that are readily available from numerous domestic and foreign sources 
our raw material purchases are made on an open account basis 
we do not have formal long term arrangements with any of our raw material suppliers 
we have experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements and consider our sources of supply adequate 
quality assurance our quality assurance program is designed to ensure that our products meet the quality standards of our customers 
we require that our vendors employ qualified quality control personnel 
competition we face a variety of competitive challenges from other domestic and far east apparel producers 
we do not currently hold a dominant competitive position in any market  including the private label apparel market 
in addition  we face competition from our own customers  who have their own internal product development and sourcing capabilities 
we believe that many of our customers who have the know how and internal resources to develop and source directly a portion of their requirements constitute our major competition 
most of our competitors are larger in size and have greater resources than we do  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in competing with them in the future 
we believe that our business will depend upon our ability to provide apparel products  which are of good quality and meet our customers pricing and delivery requirements  as well as our ability to maintain relationships with our major customers 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard 
imports and import restrictions during  we sourced our products from guatemala  mexico and from the far east 
merchandise that we imported into the united states is subject to the assessment of duty at rates currently ranging from zero to ad valorem 
such merchandise may also be subject to additional duties  export fees  quotas or other restrictions and are affected by the costs of transportation 
effective january   quota on textile and apparel products was eliminated for world trade organization wto member countries which include those countries from which the company imports its products 
however  under china s accession agreement into the wto  member countries may  under certain circumstances  re impose quota on some categories of imports from china 
in november  the united states and china entered into an agreement imposing quotas through on certain categories of textile goods from china 

table of contents in august  the united states entered into the central american free trade agreement cafta with five central american countries 
cafta became effective in guatemala in july  thus qualifying importations of textile and apparel goods from guatemala free of duty and quota 
in the ordinary course of business  the company may  from time to time  be subject to claims by the us bureau of customs and border protection customs for additional duties or charges and likewise  may be entitled to refunds from customs due to the overpayment of duties 
backlog at january  we had unfilled confirmed customer orders of  compared to  at january  all of the increase in backlog is the result of our innovo acquisition 
in general  the amount of unfilled orders at a particular time is affected by a number of factors  including the scheduling of manufacture and shipping of the product which  in some instances  depends on the customers demands 
accordingly  a comparison of unfilled orders from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of eventual actual shipments 
the acquired business has a dilution range of to on bookings for allowance for chargebacks and trade discounts 
the innovo acquisition has a dilution range of to on bookings for allowance for chargebacks and trade discounts

risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our common stock 
although the risks described below are all of the risks that we believe are material  they are not the only risks relating to our business and our common stock 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations 
any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and  therefore  you may lose all or part of your investment 
risk factors relating to our operations we rely on a few key customers for the majority of our revenue 
we historically have been dependent on one or more key customers 
a significant portion of our sales over the last three years has been to ny c 
sales to ny c accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our net sales for the years  and for the year our sales to jc penney and kohl s  our other major customers for that year  accounted for approximately  and  respectively 
for the year  our sales to jc penney  kohl s  target and aeo   and  respectively  of our net sales historically  our highest shipments are in our second quarter and third quarter  with lower sales in the fourth and first quarter 

table of contents although we have long established relationships with our major customers  we do not have long term contracts with these customers 
our future success will be dependent upon our ability to attract new customers and to maintain our relationships with our present customers 
we continue to strive to maintain our positive working relationships with our customers by providing on time deliveries of quality products at competitive prices 
we cannot assure you that our major customers will continue to purchase merchandise from us at the same rate as they have historically purchased from us  or at all in the future  or that we will be able to attract new customers 
in addition  our major customers have the ability to exert significant control over our business decisions  including prices 
since the united states discontinued textile import quotas affecting products sourced by us on january   the amount of business we do for ny c has decreased significantly  as ny c has opted to place orders in china and other countries in the far east 
we are subject to the risks of doing business abroad 
during years and  all of our products were manufactured outside the united states  at either a related party manufacturer located in mexico  non affiliated manufacturers located in guatemala and in the far east or at our manufacturing facilities located in guatemala

table of contents if we experience product quality or late delivery problems with contract manufacturers our business will be negatively affected 
historically  a significant portion of our products has been manufactured by non affiliated contract manufacturers 
in connection with the acquisition of the assets of diversified apparel  we entered into a supply agreement with azt international s 
de rl de rl  or azt  an affiliate of diversified apparel  and currently are reliant on azt to supply most of our denim apparel products 
we have from time to time experienced difficulties in obtaining timely delivery of products of acceptable quality 
such difficulties have resulted and may result in cancellation of orders  customer refusals to accept deliveries or reductions in purchase prices  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that these difficulties have resulted and may continue to result from not having sufficient access to and control over the manufacturing processes of non affiliated contract manufacturers 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience difficulties with third parties responsible for the manufacture of our products  including azt 
in addition  our supply agreement with azt terminates in july   and if it is not renewed  we may have difficulty sourcing the products manufactured by azt at a similar cost or at all 
our failure to renew the azt agreement or to find a replacement manufacturer on similar terms could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  we have been advised by hubert guez that a jury has found against him  azteca  sweet sportswear and apparel distribution services which  if such finding stands may adversely affect the financial ability of azt to continue to provide manufacturing and distribution services to us 
our direct manufacturing operations increase our operating costs 
we maintain and operate a manufacturing facility in guatemala for our non denim products 
operating manufacturing facilities rather than contracting with independent manufacturers requires us to maintain a higher level of working capital 
in addition  reduced sales would have an even greater adverse impact on our profitability in light of the fixed costs needed to own or lease and operate our own factory 
legislation relating to the importation of or decreasing or increasing the cost of textiles and apparel produced abroad could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
effective january   the united states us has discontinued textile import quotas affecting the products sourced by us

to date we have not experienced an increase in demand for our products manufactured in guatemala 

table of contents we have expanded our business through acquisitions that could result in diversion of resources and extra expenses 
this could disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial condition 
historically  we have pursued acquisitions to expand our business 
on may   we acquired certain assets related to the private label apparel division of innovo and innovo azteca apparel  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of innovo 
on july   we acquired diversified apparel s branded and private label denim apparel business 
as a result of these acquisitions  we have substantial indebtedness which could decrease our flexibility to react to changing economic conditions 
two stockholders now control a majority of our outstanding common stock and thus control many decisions  including the election of directors and the sale of our company 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses could divert our management s time and resources 
acquired businesses may not be successfully integrated with our operations 
we may not realize the intended benefits of any acquisition 
the cyclical nature of the apparel industry and uncertainty over future economic prospects could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the fashion apparel industry in which we operate is cyclical 
many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the industry  including  among others general business conditions  interest rates  the availability of consumer credit  taxation  and consumer confidence in future economic conditions 
consumer purchases of discretionary items  including our products  may decline during recessionary periods and also may decline at other times when disposable income is lower 
a downturn in the economies in which we sell our products may adversely affect our sales 
in addition  various retailers  including some of our customers  have experienced financial difficulties during recent years  which has increased our risk of losing customers and increased the risk of extending credit to such retailers 
the seasonal nature of our business makes management more difficult  severely reduces cash flow and liquidity during parts of the year and could force us to curtail operations 
our business is seasonal 
our greatest volume of shipments and sales occur from late spring through the summer  which coincides with our second and third fiscal quarters 
historically  our cash flow is strongest in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
unfavorable economic conditions affecting retailers during the fall and holiday seasons in any year could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the year 
we are likely to experience periods of negative cash flow throughout each year and a drop off in business commencing each december  which could force us to curtail operations if adequate liquidity is not available 
we cannot assure you that the effects of such seasonality will diminish in the future 

table of contents if we lose the services of our key personnel  our business will be harmed 
our future success depends on bernard manuel  chairman of the board and chief executive officer and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of mr 
manuel and any negative market or industry perception arising from the loss of his services could have a material adverse effect on us and the price of our shares 
our other executive officer  roy green  our senior vice president chief financial officer and secretary  has substantial experience and expertise in our business and has made significant contributions to our success 
his employment agreement was terminated in connection with the acquisition of the acquired business and he is now an employee at will 
there can be no assurance that mr 
green will remain an employee of cygne 
the unexpected loss of services of either of these individuals could adversely affect us 
our continued success is also dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified employees to support any future growth that we may experience 
we face intense competition in the worldwide apparel industry 
we face a variety of competitive challenges from other domestic and foreign fashion oriented apparel producers 
we do not currently hold a dominant competitive position in any market  including the private label apparel market  which is highly fragmented 
we compete with competitors such as kellwood  jones apparel group  and vf corp 
primarily on the basis of anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands in a timely manner  maintaining favorable brand recognition  developing innovative  high quality products in sizes  colors and styles that appeal to customers  appropriately pricing products  providing strong and effective marketing support  creating an acceptable value proposition for retail customers  ensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain efficiencies with manufacturers and retailers  and obtaining sufficient retail floor space and effective presentation of our products at retail 
in addition  we face competition from our own customers  who have their own internal product development and sourcing capabilities 
we believe that many of our customers who have the know how and internal resources to develop and source directly a portion of their requirements constitute our major competition 
most of our competitors are larger in size and have greater resources than we do  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in competing with them in the future 

table of contents our business could be negatively impacted by the financial instability or consolidation of our customers 
our customers are retailers located in the united states 
financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to curtail business with that customer 
we may also assume more credit risk relating to that customer s receivables 
our inability to collect on our trade accounts receivable from any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
more specifically  we are dependent primarily on lines of credit that we establish from time to time with customers  and should a substantial number of customers become unable to pay their respective debts as they become due  we may be unable to collect some or all of the monies owed by those customers 
furthermore  in recent years  the retail industry has experienced consolidation and other ownership changes 
some of our customers have operated under the protection of the federal bankruptcy laws 
while to date these changes in the retail industry have not had a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition  our business could be materially affected by these changes in the future 
we are currently dependent on supply and distribution agreements with diversified apparel and its related entities for a substantial portion of our supply  distribution and back office capabilities 
in connection with our acquisition of the acquired business  we entered into a supply agreement and a distribution agreement for a two year period ending july  with diversified apparel and its affiliated entities which we collectively refer to as diversified apparel 
under the terms of the supply agreement  diversified apparel will manufacture and supply us with our entire requirements of branded and private label denim apparel products 
although diversified apparel is obligated to deliver denim products ordered by us under the supply agreement  we have no obligation to source denim products from azt 
under the terms of the distribution agreement  diversified apparel will provide us with specified distribution and back office operations services 
in addition  diversified is our vendor for all far east finished goods purchases 
the loss of our supply and distribution agreements with diversified apparel could adversely affect our current supply responsibilities 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew these agreements on acceptable terms  or at all 
if these agreements are not renewed  we may have difficulty sourcing the products manufactured by azt and distributing our products at a similar cost or at all 
our failure to renew either of the azt agreements or to find a replacement manufacturer or distributor on similar terms could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  we have been advised by hubert guez that a jury has found against him  azteca  sweet sportswear and apparel distribution services which  if such finding stands may adversely affect the financial ability of azt to continue to provide manufacturing and distribution services to us 
our trademark and other intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected outside of the united states 
we believe that our trademarks  whether licensed to or owned by us  and other proprietary rights will be important to our success and our competitive position in the branded market 
we may  however  experience conflict with various third parties who acquire or claim ownership rights in certain trademarks 
we cannot assure that the actions we have taken to establish and protect these trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and proprietary rights of others 
in addition  enforcing rights to our intellectual property may be difficult and expensive  and we may not be successful in combating counterfeit products and stopping 
table of contents infringement of our intellectual property rights  which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share 
furthermore  our efforts to enforce our trademark and other intellectual property rights may be met with defenses  counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our trademark and other intellectual property rights 
if we are unsuccessful in protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights  continued sales of such competing products by third parties could harm our brand and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our debt levels may limit our flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities 
we have a significant amount of debt 
at january   we had indebtedness of million and during the years and we have received advances from our factor of approximately of our factored receivables or and million  respectively 
our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to us  including the following our ability to obtain additional financing  if necessary  for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms  we will need a substantial portion of our cash flow to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness  reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for our operations and future business opportunities  we may issue a substantial portion of our authorized common shares for the purpose of making principal and interest payments on our indebtedness  reducing the shares that would otherwise be available for financing our future business opportunities and potentially diluting our common stock  our debt level may make us more vulnerable than our competitors with less debt to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally  and our debt level may limit our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions 
we currently plan to seek stockholder approval of the issuance of up to  shares of our common stock in satisfaction of the million principal amount of our outstanding million subordinated promissory note 
we would issue  shares of our common stock in payment of million of the note  issue a convertible note in the principal amount of million that is convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share in payment of million of the note  and issue a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the holder of the note has agreed that we are only obligated to pay the remaining million as and when we have available funds 
in addition  any indebtedness we incur will be subject and subordinated to our obligations to milberg factors and our million subordinated promissory note issued in the acquisition of the acquired business  or the note 
accordingly  our ability to obtain additional debt financing is highly uncertain 
our ability to service our indebtedness will depend upon  among other things  our future financial and operating performance and cash flows  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business  regulatory and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
if our operating results and cash flows are not sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness  we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying our business activities  acquisitions  investments and or capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness  or seeking additional equity capital or bankruptcy protection 
we may not be able to affect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms  or at all 
in addition  our obligations under the factoring agreement with milberg factors and our obligations under the note are secured by substantially all our assets and if we are unable to repay our indebtedness  the lenders could seek to foreclose on such assets 
if new debt is added to our current debt levels  the related risks that we now face could intensify

we have a factoring agreement agreement with milberg factors  inc milberg which expires on july  the agreement is automatically renewed for successive periods of one year unless terminated by the company by giving days written notice 
in addition  milberg may terminate the agreement at any time by giving the company days written notice 
the agreement requires milberg to purchase our trade accounts receivable which are acceptable to milberg without recourse 
milberg  at its discretion  can advance us up to of our net outstanding trade receivables 
these advances are repayable on demand 
the milberg advances are a critical component of our working capital

our warehouse facility is located in california near major earthquake faults that have experienced earthquakes in the past 
an earthquake or other natural disaster could disrupt our operations 
additionally  the loss of electric power  such as the temporary loss of power caused by power shortages in the grid servicing our warehouse facility  could disrupt operations or impair critical systems 
any of these disruptions or other events outside of our control could affect our business negatively  harming our operating results 
in addition  if any facilities of our suppliers or customers are affected by earthquakes  power shortages  floods  hurricanes monsoons  terrorism or other events outside of our control  our business could suffer 
if our stockholders approve the issuance of shares of our common stock  a convertible note and a warrant in payment of million principal amount of our outstanding million subordinated promissory note  we will record a loss on extinguishment of debt  which will adversely affect our results of operations for in connection with our acquisition of the acquired business from diversified apparel  we issued a secured subordinated promissory note in the principal amount of million  of which million is currently outstanding 
we obtained a third party valuation to determine the fair value of the note for the purposes of determining the purchase price of the acquired business 
as a result  we recorded a debt discount of  to reduce the carrying value of the note to fair value 
the discount is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan 
on january   we and diversified apparel entered into a note conversion agreement providing for the conversion of  of the principal amount of the promissory note to diversified apparel into  shares of our common stock at the rate of per share 
in connection with the conversion of  principal amount of the note  a loss on extinguishment recorded as a component of interest expense of approximately million was recorded representing the pro rata unamortized discount 
effective january   we and mr 
kraif  the current holder of the note  agreed  subject to stockholder approval  to exchange million principal amount of the note for  shares of common stock  to exchange million of the note for a million convertible promissory note  with a conversion price per share of  subject to adjustment under certain circumstances  and to issue to mr 
kraif a warrant to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price per share of  subject to adjustment under certain circumstances 
the remaining million principal amount of the note will be converted into a liability of cygne payable as and to the extent we have available funds 
if cygne s stockholders approve this transaction  cygne will record a loss on extinguishment of debt  since the fair value of the stock  convertible note and warrants to be issued in the transaction exceeds the carrying value of the note  due primarily to the unamortized discount at the time of exchange 
this expense will adversely affect our results of operations for 
table of contents our business could suffer if our third party manufacturers violate labor laws or fail to conform to generally accepted ethical standards 
we generally require our third party manufacturers to meet our standards for working conditions and other matters before we are willing to place business with them 
as a result  we may not always obtain the lowest cost production 
moreover  we do not control our third party manufacturers or their respective labor practices 
if one of our third party manufacturers violates generally accepted labor standards by  for example  using forced or indentured labor or child labor  failing to pay compensation in accordance with local law  failing to operate its factories in compliance with local safety regulations  or diverging from other labor practices generally accepted as ethical  we likely would cease dealing with that manufacturer  and we could suffer an interruption in our product supply

although private label gross margins are lower than the gross margins in the brand name apparel industry  collection and markdown costs are typically commensurably lower  and inventory turns are generally higher 
inventory risks are also generally reduced because the purchasing of fabric and other supplies begins only after purchase commitments have been obtained from customers

guatemala ratified cafta as of july  we anticipate that  over time  cafta may make guatemala more competitive with imports from the far east in the categories manufactured by us in guatemala  although we cannot assure you this will happen 
to date we have not experienced an increase in demand for our products manufactured in guatemala 
we have incurred costs in restructuring our operations due to loss of customers 
we are continuing to review our existing business operations and could incur additional costs in the future associated with the further restructuring of our operations 
the apparel industry is highly competitive and historically has been subject to substantial cyclical variation  with purchases of apparel and related goods tending to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is low

restatement on december   management determined to change our previous accounting for amounts due from milberg net of advances received from milberg as a current asset in the balance sheet 
our management determined that it was more appropriate to report amounts due from milberg as a current asset and advances from milberg as a current liability because advances from milberg are due on demand and amounts due from milberg are payable upon receipt of payment by milberg from our customers 
as a result  our management determined that it was more appropriate to report amounts due from milberg as a current asset and advances from milberg as a current liability because advances from milberg are due on demand and amounts due from milberg are payable upon receipt of payment by milberg from the company s customers 
the statements of cash flows have been revised to present advances from milberg and repayment of those advances as financing activities and the change in amounts due from milberg as an operating activity 
we also corrected errors identified related to the income tax expense and related deferred taxes payable for the three and nine months ended october  in order to increase the amount of the valuation allowance previously provided 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and sfas no  goodwill and other intangible assets  for taxable business combinations that yield tax deductible goodwill  there is an accumulation of deferred tax liabilities over time as goodwill is deducted on tax returns but not amortized for financial reporting purposes 
the deferred tax liabilities will reverse if impairment charges are recognized or when the business is disposed of through sale or otherwise 
we had netted the deferred tax liability resulting from the indefinite life goodwill with gross deferred tax assets and provided a valuation allowance on the net asset balance 
because of the uncertainty of the timing of the reversal of the deferred tax liability related to the goodwill temporary difference  we have determined that the valuation allowance should have been provided against the net deferred tax assets without taking into account the indefinite lived goodwill 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates

we estimate the allowances for customer chargebacks and trade discounts to be applied against our factored trade accounts receivable considering both historical and anticipated deductions taken by customers

a change in this estimate could result in the need to record additional reserves

a change in our determination of the permanent portion of losses on marketable securities could result in additional expense charged to operations 
inventories we estimate the amount of goods that we will not be able to sell in the normal course of business and write down the value of these goods to the recovery value expected to be realized through off price channels 
in addition  we review the amount of goods for which we have purchase commitments to determine what we will not be able to sell in the normal course of business and record the anticipated loss on these goods based on the recovery value of the goods expected to be realized through off price channels 
a change in this estimate could result in the need to record additional reserves 
income taxes we estimate the amounts of additional income taxes that may be assessed by the various taxing authorities upon audit of our filed tax returns based upon our knowledge of the cases and upon the advice of our tax counsel 
a change in the estimated additional liability for income taxes could result in a higher provision for income taxes 
we estimate the valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset due to our history of losses and near break even results 
however  should we conclude that utilization of deferred tax assets is more likely than not  the value of the deferred tax asset would be increased by eliminating some or all of the valuation allowance 
the deferred tax assets are net of deferred tax liabilities except for deferred tax liabilities originating from our taxable business combinations that resulted in tax deductible goodwill 
in these instances  deferred tax liabilities accumulate over time as goodwill is deducted on tax returns but not amortized for financial reporting purposes 
these deferred tax liabilities will reverse if impairment charges are recognized or when the business is disposed of through sale or otherwise 
because of the uncertainty of the timing of the reversal of the deferred tax liability related to the goodwill temporary difference  these deferred tax liabilities are not netted against our deferred tax assets in determining the valuation allowance

impairment of long lived assets and goodwill long lived assets consist of property and equipment  intangible assets  and goodwill 
intangible assets are comprised of trademarks  costs to create product lines  and the value of existing purchase orders acquired in the acquired business and innovo acquisition 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider to be important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment and the carrying value of the asset cannot be recovered from projected undiscounted cash flows  we record an impairment charge 
we measure any goodwill impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model 
significant management judgment is required in determining whether an indicator of impairment exists and in projecting cash flows 
amortization of discounts on secured subordinated promissory note and on deferred purchase price we recorded the fair value of the secured subordinated promissory note issued in connection with the acquisition at  which was originally a  discount from the face value of the  note 
the discount to the note is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the note

foreign currency exchange the company negotiates substantially all its purchase orders with its foreign manufacturers in us dollars 
thus  notwithstanding any fluctuation in foreign currencies  the company s cost for any purchase order is not subject to change after the time the order is placed 
however  the weakening of the us dollar against local currencies could lead certain manufacturers to increase their us dollar prices for products 
the company believes it would be able to compensate for any such price increase
