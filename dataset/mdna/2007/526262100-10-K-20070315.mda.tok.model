table of contents item a 
risk factors our business faces many risks 
any of the risks discussed below  or elsewhere in this annual report on form k or in our other sec filings  could have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial might also impair our business operations 
our ability to secure and manage debt financing may significantly impact on our ability to operate 
as of december   we had million of debt outstanding under our term and revolver credit facilities 
we are currently operating under limited waivers of specified events of default within these credit facilities  and these limited waivers expire on april  on or before this date  we will either have to negotiate amendments to these credit facilities  or in the alternative  obtain new credit agreements with other lenders 
due to our existing levels of indebtedness and the seasonal nature of our business  which requires us to use our revolving credit facility to finance operations during the year  our ability to operate is dependent upon our ability to secure adequate financing in a timely fashion 
the company is currently in discussions with the agent under its existing credit facilities as well as with other potential lenders regarding a modified or new lending arrangement 
while the company is optimistic it will be able to amend its existing facilities or enter into new facilities  it cannot provide assurance that it will occur  which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
in addition  if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to pay off the outstanding debt under our term and revolver credit facilities or any new credit agreement that we may enter into after april   our financial results and financial condition would be significantly impaired 
our sales could be negatively impacted if our major customers substantially reduce orders for our products 
with the exception of two major accounts  federated department stores  inc and bed bath beyond  our customer base is relatively dispersed 
our sales to these two customers accounted for approximately of our net sales for fiscal year if federated department  inc stores and or bed bath beyond were to cease or significantly reduce their business with us  our business and results of operations would be negatively impacted 
our reliance on foreign manufacturing is subject to inherent risk  which may affect our ability to procure goods and or procure them in a timely fashion 
foreign manufacturing and procurement of imports is subject to the following inherent risks labor availability and increases in labor costs  increases in the cost of raw materials  economic and political instability  cost and capacity fluctuations and delays in transportation  dockage and material handling  restrictive actions by governments  nationalizations  the laws and policies of the united states affecting importation of goods including duties  quota and taxes  international political  military and terrorist developments  and foreign trade and tax laws 
moreover  we cannot predict what relevant political  legal or regulatory changes may occur  or the type or amount of any financial impact on us that such changes may have in the future 
our products are subject to customs duties and regulations pertaining to the importation of goods 
in the ordinary course of business  we may be involved in disputes with the us bureau of customs and border protection us customs regarding the amount of duty to be paid  the value of merchandise to be reported or other customs regulations  which may result in the payment of additional duties and or penalties  or in the refund of duties to us 
since the terrorist attacks of september   us customs has enacted various security protocols affecting the importation of goods 
such protocols could adversely affect the speed or cost involved in our receipt of inventory from our overseas vendors 
the inability to make timely shipments of merchandise to our trade customers due to delays caused by foreign sourcing could significantly lower sales and damage our relationship with trade customers resulting in harm to our financial results 

table of contents our reliance on manufacturing from sources within china  in particular  is subject to inherent risk  which may affect our ability to procure goods and or procure them in a timely fashion 
in fiscal year  approximately of our imports were manufactured in china  and we anticipate that such percentage will hold constant or increase for the foreseeable future 
china has joined the world trade organization and been accorded permanent normal trade relations status by the us government 
however  various commercial and legal practices in china  including the handling of intellectual property and certain labor practices  are under review by the us government 
china has been designated a country of particular concern cpc pursuant to the international religious freedom act of irfa 
the irfa enumerates several specific retaliatory actions that may be taken by the us government  none of which we believe would have a material impact on our business 
the irfa  however  also accords the president broad discretion in fashioning other or additional actions and  due to the breadth of the presidential powers under the irfa  we are unable to predict what  if any  action the president could take in the future 
accordingly  the ability to continue to conduct business with vendors located in china is subject to political uncertainties  the financial impact of which we are unable to estimate 
to the extent china may have its exports or transaction of business with us persons subject to political retaliation  the cost of chinese imports could increase significantly and or the ability to import goods from china may be materially impaired 
in such an event  there could be an adverse effect on us until alternative arrangements for the manufacture of our products were obtained on economic  production and operational terms at least as favorable as those currently in effect 
we are subject to risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates present risks inherent in our method of inventory procurement 
our costs could be adversely affected if the currencies of other countries in which we source product appreciate significantly relative to the us dollar 
this could result  for example  from a decision by china to revalue the renminbi rnb relative to the us dollar or to allow the rnb to float instead of being pegged to the us dollar at a fixed rate 
if interest rates on our variable rate debt were to increase  our financial results would be negatively affected 
a principal market risk affecting us is the exposure to changes in the interest rates on our variable rate debt 
as our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates  our results of operations and cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
based on debt outstanding at december   a increase or decrease in current market interest rates would have an impact of approximately million on an annual basis 
we may encounter litigation that has a material impact on our business 
we are involved on an ongoing basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
trends in litigation may include claims brought by consumers  shareholders  vendors  accounts and or injured persons in cases relating to antitrust  employment and labor  environmental  negligence and regulatory matters 
litigation trends and the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation trends and outcomes could adversely affect our financial results 

table of contents our inability to adapt successfully to changing consumer preferences may damage our business 
our success is dependent upon consumer demand for our products 
our ability to anticipate consumer preferences and create tabletop  gift and collectible products which appeal to consumers who shop in our market channels is critical to achieving financial results 
as a related factor  our ability to identify  hire and retain quality designers and sculptors and other artistic talent is critical to our product development efforts and our ability to innovate successfully 
our failure to successfully anticipate  identify and react to consumers current preferences in our market channels  and to identify  hire and retain artistic talent  could significantly lower sales of our products and harm our financial results 
if we are unable to complete our operational improvements  including improving our inventory management and forecasting systems to make our supply chain more efficient  improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our us manufacturing operations  and integrating our legacy department and lenox information  operating and distribution systems  our business results may be adversely impacted 
in response to market changes  including department store consolidation and a decrease in the sales of collectibles and fine tableware over the past few years  we are restructuring our operations to achieve revenue and cost synergies  including a consolidation of our distribution facilities and a reduction in force and cost reduction initiative at our north carolina bone china factory 
if we are not successful in doing so  however  the reduced sales resulting from these external market trends may have an adverse impact on our financial results 
in addition  we have implemented plans to improve our inventory management and provide more accurate forecasting to enhance the efficiency of our supply chain 
the highly seasonal nature of our business  with a majority of our sales occurring in the third and fourth quarters in anticipation of the holiday season  requires us accurately to forecast demand for products in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers 
excess inventory poses particular risks to our brand when sold through liquidation channels 
if we do not successfully implement and operate our new inventory management and forecasting systems  we may adversely affect our financial results 
following our acquisition of lenox  we have been working to integrate the information systems  operating systems  fulfillment processes and distribution resources of department and lenox 
if we are unable successfully to integrate systems and functional resources  we will not be able operate in the most effective and cost efficient manner which may have an adverse impact on our financial results 
if we are unable to manage employee turnover through our integration of department and lenox and the completion of our operational improvement process  our business could be adversely impacted 
we value and are dependent on key employees throughout the company for our business success 
in addition  an important element of our strategy is to utilize the expertise of key employees to integrate successfully the legacy department and lenox operations and complete our operational improvement process 
as a result of the company s past performance and current restructuring efforts  employee turnover has occurred and is expected to continue 
if employee turnover is not managed effectively  the implementation of business improvements  employee morale and results of our operations could be adversely impacted

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of cash are the funds generated from operations and its revolving credit facility  which is available for working capital and investment needs 
consistent with customary practice in the giftware industry  the company offers extended payment terms to some of its wholesale customers 
this practice has created significant working capital requirements as the company uses cash to source inventory  but does not receive cash from its customers until the fourth quarter and early first quarter of the subsequent year when the extended payment terms come due 
similarly  the company s retail and direct segments create working capital requirements during the first nine months of the year with revenue and cash collections peaking during the holiday season in the fourth quarter and early first quarter of the subsequent year 
the company finances these working capital requirements with seasonal borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
cash collected in the fourth quarter and first quarter of the subsequent year is used to repay the seasonal borrowings

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
in connection with the preparation of the financial statements  we are required to make assumptions  make estimates and apply judgment that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures 
the company bases its assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
management believes the following critical accounting policies require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and are therefore particularly important to an understanding of the company s results of operations and financial position sales returns and credits an allowance is established for credits related to possible returned or damaged product  markdowns and pricing and shipping discrepancies 
the amount of the allowance is based on historical ratios of credits to sales  the historical average length of time between the sale and the credit  and other factors 
changes in customers behavior versus historical experience  changes in product damage or defect rates  or changes in the company s return policies are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
based on sales returns and credits  a increase or decrease in sales returns and credits would have had an impact of approximately million 
inventory valuation inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
the amount is determined by analyzing historical and projected sales information  plans for discontinued products and other factors 
the company procures product based on forecasted sales volume 
if actual sales were significantly lower than forecasted sales due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions  it could result in materially higher surplus and discontinued inventories 
based on inventory write downs  a increase or decrease in inventory write downs would have had an impact of less than million 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable based on an evaluation of its accounts receivable balance 
this evaluation includes a number of factors including the age of the receivable  the financial condition of the customer  the current business environment and the historical collection experience for customers and consumers of similar background and nature 
additionally  since many of the company s wholesale sales have dating terms which come due in november and december  the company does not have visibility into overdue balances for many of its wholesale customers until the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 
due to the seasonality of the company s business  the extended dating terms provided to wholesale customers and the relative size of accounts receivable balances at year end  it is not uncommon for the company to experience fluctuations in the provision for bad debt expense from quarter to quarter as the company refines its estimate 
unexpected changes in the aforementioned factors would result in materially different amounts for this item 
in addition  results could be materially different if economic conditions worsened for the company s customers 
based on bad debt write offs  a increase or decrease in bad debt write offs would have had an impact of approximately million 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets on the company s consolidated balance sheet consist primarily of property and equipment 
the company periodically reviews the carrying value of these assets based  in part  upon projections of anticipated undiscounted cash flows 
management undertakes this review when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished 
any impairment charge recorded reduces earnings 
while the company believes future estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets within which the company operates could affect evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 

table of contents valuation of goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets the company evaluates goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets on a periodic basis 
this evaluation relies on assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or related assumptions change  the company may be required to recognize impairment charges 
pension and postretirement benefits the company sponsors various defined benefit pension plans as well as postretirement plans providing retiree health care and retiree life insurance benefits 
benefits are based on such factors as years of service and compensation level during employment 
the benefits expected to be paid are expensed over the employee s expected service 
to determine the expected benefits to be paid  the company has to make assumptions regarding interest rates  return on plan assets and expected health care trend rates 
actual experience different from these assumptions could result in materially different benefit payments 
in december  the company adopted sfas no 
 employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas 
sfas requires that the company recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the company s year end balance sheet  with changes in the funded status recognized through comprehensive income in the year in which they occur 
tax contingencies the company is periodically contacted or audited by federal and state tax authorities 
these contacts or audits include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions  the company records a reserve for estimated probable exposures 
the estimate of this reserve contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate the exposure associated with its various filing positions 
to the extent the company does not have to pay taxes for which reserves have been established or is required to pay amounts in excess of its reserves  the company s tax rate in a given financial period could be materially impacted 
stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r the estimated grant date fair value of each stock based award is recognized in income on an accelerated basis for existing options and a straight line basis for new grants over the requisite service period 
the estimated fair value of each option is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the company makes certain assumptions using the black scholes option pricing model which includes the risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected stock price volatility  expected life and expected forfeitures 
nonvested restricted stock is recorded as compensation cost over the requisite service periods based on the market value on the date of grant 
prior to january   the company applied the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
to stock options and other stock based incentive plans as permitted pursuant to sfas in accordance with apb opinion no 
 cost for stock based compensation was recognized in income based on the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date of the award or other measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
the exercise price for stock options granted to employees equaled the fair market value of the company s common stock at the date of grant  thereby resulting in no recognition of compensation expense 
nonvested restricted stock was recorded as compensation cost over the requisite service periods based on the market value on the date of grant

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of the company s exposure to market risk contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the information presented has been prepared utilizing certain assumptions considered reasonable in light of information currently available to management 
given the unpredictability of interest rates as well as other factors  actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward looking information 
the company s market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates

the company s credit facilities bear interest at variable rates 
as a result of this variable interest rate debt  the company s results of operations and cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
based on debt outstanding at december   a increase or decrease in current market interest rates would have an impact of approximately million on an annual basis 
less than of the company s wholesale sales and less than of the company s sourced product purchases in fiscal year were denominated in a foreign currency 
based on these sales and product purchases  a increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates would have an impact of less than million 
at this time  the company does not use derivative instruments to manage the exchange rate risk
