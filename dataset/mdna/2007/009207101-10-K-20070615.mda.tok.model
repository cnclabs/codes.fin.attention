item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company operates in two business segments  providing overnight air cargo services to the express delivery services industry and aviation ground support and other specialized equipment products to passenger and cargo airlines  airports  the military and industrial customers 
each business segment has separate management teams and infrastructures that offer different products and services 
the company s air cargo operations  which are comprised of its mountain air cargo  inc mac and csa air  inc 
csa subsidiaries  accounted for of revenue in fiscal the company s ground support operations  comprised of its global ground support  llc subsidiary global  accounted for the remaining of revenues 
following is a table detailing revenues by segment and by major customer category overnight air cargo segment fedex ground equipment segment military foreign countries other commercial mac and csa are short haul express air freight carriers and provide air cargo services exclusively to one customer  fedex corporation fedex 
under the terms of the dry lease service agreements  which currently cover the majority of the revenue aircraft operated  the company receives an administrative fee based on the number of aircraft operated in revenue service and passes through to its customer certain cost components of its operations without markup 
the cost of fuel  flight crews  landing fees  outside maintenance  parts and certain other direct operating costs are included in operating expenses and billed to the customer as cargo and maintenance revenue  at cost 
these agreements are renewable on two to five year terms and may be terminated by fedex at any time upon days notice 
the company believes that the short term and other provisions of its agreements with fedex are standard within the air freight contract delivery service industry 
fedex has been a customer of the company since loss of its contracts with fedex would have a material adverse effect on the company 
separate agreements cover the five types of aircraft operated by mac and csa for fedex cessna caravan  atr  atr  fokker f  and short brothers sd the cessna caravan  atr  atr and fokker f aircraft a total of aircraft at march  are owned by and dry leased from fedex  and the short brothers sd aircraft two aircraft at march  are owned by the company and operated periodically under wet lease arrangements with fedex 
pursuant to such agreements  fedex determines the type of aircraft and schedule of routes to be flown by mac and csa  with all other operational decisions made by the company 
mac and csa s revenue contributed approximately  and  to the company s revenues in fiscal and  respectively  a current year net decrease of  
the company and its air cargo segment s financial results in fiscal continue to be affected by fedex s decision to modernize a portion of the aircraft fleet operated by mac by replacing older fokker f aircraft with newer atr and atr aircraft 
mac was engaged to assist in the certification and conversion of atr aircraft from passenger to cargo configuration and experienced a substantial increase in maintenance revenue in fiscal as the conversion program hit its peak  then experienced a decrease in maintenance revenue in fiscal as the conversion program was completed and the aircraft were placed in revenue service 
the company experienced a further significant reduction in maintenance revenue in fiscal with no revenue from the conversion program and also because the aircraft that were converted had not yet reached a full cycle for recurring heavy maintenance 
the majority of these conversion activities  representing the cost of aircraft parts  have been billed to the customer without mark up 
the company also increased its operating income in fiscal and as a result of the aircraft conversions  as the increased labor hours resulted in increased productivity and margins 
the company saw a marked decrease in revenues in fiscal  principally attributable to a return to normalized operations after the aircraft conversion program 
the air cargo  segment s operating income for fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal  a decrease 
in addition  the company s maintenance revenues fluctuate based on the level of heavy maintenance checks performed on aircraft operated by its air cargo operations 
because most of the atr aircraft were placed in service during a relatively short time span  they are on roughly the same maintenance schedule  and the next heavy maintenance checks due on these aircraft would not be anticipated to start until the fiscal year ending march  unless there is an acceleration of the heavy maintenance checks schedule  which is based on aircraft usage  or the company is able to attract additional maintenance projects  maintenance revenues in fiscal are likely to be lower than in fiscal and cost cutting measures implemented at mac during the latter half of fiscal partially offset the effect of reduced maintenance revenues in that period and are anticipated to have a continuing impact going forward 
global manufactures  services and supports aircraft deicers and ground support equipment and other specialized industrial equipment on a worldwide basis 
global s revenues contributed approximately  and  to the company s revenues in fiscal and  respectively  a current year decrease of 
in fiscal  global revenues were of consolidated revenues  only slightly above the in fiscal  but this percentage has increased significantly from in fiscal this trend shows the increasing significance of global to the consolidated results of the company 
revenues in were affected by a significant decrease in the number of commercial deicers sold compared to both domestically and foreign  somewhat offset by increased unit sales to the military and increased service and training income 
although sales revenue decreased  global had a substantially higher gross margin and profit in fiscal global s segment operating income for fiscal was  a increase over fiscal segment operating income of  the reasons for the increase in segment operating income were an improved customer and product mix and a decrease in costs associated with the philadelphia boom incident  discussed below 
in june  global was awarded a four year contract to supply deicing equipment to the united states air force 
in june global was awarded a three year extension of that contract and a further three year extension was awarded in june in fiscal  revenues from sales to the air force accounted for approximately of the ground equipment segment s revenues as compared to in fiscal global s results in fiscal were adversely affected as the result of the collapse of one of twelve fixed stand deicing booms sold by global for installation at the philadelphia airport 
following the collapse of the boom  global undertook to examine and repair the eleven remaining booms and incurred expense of approximately  in connection these activities 
no similar costs were incurred in fiscal although global has initiated legal action to recover these expenses from its subcontractor  the company  cannot provide assurance of the amount or timing of any such recovery 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes the changes and trends in the company s operating expenses for continuing operations as a percentage of revenue fiscal year ended march  operating revenues in thousands operating expenses as a percent of revenue flight operations maintenance ground equipment general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses the company  which incurred an increase in professional fees in fiscal due to the anticipated internal controls audit requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act sox of  reduced sox related professional fees in fiscal and due to sec approved extensions in the section implementation deadlines for smaller companies  including the company 
the requirements of section of sox are currently scheduled to apply to the company s fiscal year 
section requires management of the company to document  test  and issue an opinion as to the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  section requires the company s independent accountants to review the company s internal control documentation and testing results  and to issue its opinion as to the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting  which requirement is currently scheduled to be applicable for the company s fiscal year 
the company anticipates that under the current phase in schedule  compliance with these requirements of section will increase professional fees in fiscal and fiscal vs 
consolidated revenue from operations decreased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in revenue resulted from a decrease in air cargo revenue of  to  in fiscal  combined with a decrease in ground equipment revenue of  to  as described in overview above 
the decrease in air cargo revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in expenses that are passed through to the customer at cost  primarily relating to the aircraft conversion program that was undertaken in fiscal and completed in fiscal air cargo revenues have returned to levels similar to fiscal  prior to commencement of the customer fleet modernization program 
we expect this level of air cargo revenues to be more indicative of air cargo revenues for fiscal the decrease in ground equipment revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in the number of commercial deicing units sold by global  largely due to a decrease in foreign sales in china  the united kingdom and canada 
the decrease in foreign sales has been partially offset by increased sales to the united states military and increases in service and training income operating expenses on a consolidated basis decreased  to  for fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in air cargo operating expenses consisted of the following changes cost of flight operations decreased  primarily as a result of decreased direct operating costs  including pilot salaries and related benefits  fuel  airport fees  and costs associated with pilot travel and decreased administrative staffing due to flight schedule changes 
this was also a byproduct of the aircraft conversion program as pilot costs were up significantly during the program as mac ramped up for a new aircraft type and had dual staffing and training requirements 
these costs have returned to historic levels as mac has resumed normal operations with the new fleet of aircraft in fiscal aircraft maintenance expenses decreased  primarily as a result of decreases in maintenance costs that are passed through to the customer at cost  the cost of contract services  maintenance personnel  travel  and outside maintenance related to completion of the customer fleet modernization in fiscal ground equipment costs decreased   which included decreased cost of parts and supplies and labor related to the decreased customer orders and sales by global in fiscal we also made some strategic purchasing decisions during fiscal that increased interim inventory levels but resulted in decreased production costs 
in addition  we incurred  in remediation costs in fiscal associated with the incident involving one of global s deicing booms in philadelphia 
gross margin on ground equipment increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this was the result of the change in customer mix  with fewer commercial units and an increase in military units  as well as increased service and training income 
the military units are of similar configuration resulting in production efficiencies 
the military units also generally include higher margin options 
in addition  the philadelphia remediation costs negatively impacted the gross margin 
general and administrative expense remained fairly constant with a net decrease of  the company incurred compensation expense related to stock options of  in fiscal as a result of adopting sfas r share based payment sfas r at the beginning of the fiscal year 
staffing and benefits and staff travel costs decreased in fiscal as a result of a number of management personnel retirements and also to return to staffing levels prior to the aircraft conversion program 
operating income for the year ended march  was  a  improvement over fiscal the majority of the improvement came in the ground support segment 
global s current fiscal year operating income increased compared to its prior fiscal year primarily due to current period s higher levels of equipment margins and the  in cost associated with the repair of deicing booms in philadelphia in fiscal non operating income  net was a net income amount of  in fiscal compared to a net expense of  in fiscal interest expense was consistent from year to year 
investment income increased by  in fiscal due to increased rates on investments  as well as an increase in the amounts invested in income tax expense of  in fiscal represented an effective tax rate of  which included the benefit of municipal bond income as well as the impact of us production deduction authorized under tax law changes enacted in fiscal income tax expense of  in fiscal represented an effective tax rate of  which included a reduction associated with a true up of deferred tax assets in the prior fiscal year 
net earnings were  or per diluted share for the year ended march   a improvement over  or per diluted share in fiscal fiscal vs 
consolidated revenue from operations increased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in revenue resulted from an increase in air cargo revenue of  to  in fiscal  combined with a  increase in ground equipment revenues to  in fiscal the increase in air cargo revenue was primarily the result of an increase in expenses that are passed through to the customer at cost  primarily relating to the aircraft conversion program that was undertaken in fiscal and completed in fiscal  as discussed in overview above 
the increase in ground equipment revenue was primarily the result of an increase in the number of commercial deicing units sold by global in fiscal  largely due to orders from china  the united kingdom and canada 
operating expenses on a consolidated basis increased  to  for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in air cargo operating expenses consisted of the following changes cost of flight operations increased  primarily as a result of increased direct operating costs  including pilot salaries and related benefits  fuel  airport fees  and costs associated with pilot travel  due to increased cost of oil  flight schedule changes and increased administrative staffing due to fleet modernization and route expansion programs  maintenance expenses decreased  primarily as a result of decreases in cost of contract services  maintenance personnel  travel  and outside maintenance related to the completion of customer fleet modernization  partially offset by increased operating cost related to the route expansion 
ground equipment costs increased   which included increased cost of parts and supplies and support personnel related to increased customer orders and  in remediation costs associated with the incident involving one of global s deicing booms in philadelphia 
gross margin on ground equipment increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this was the result of increased foreign sales in  although the gross margin percentage was down as a result of the costs associated with the philadelphia boom incident 
general and administrative expense increased  primarily as a result of a provision for bad debt expense  increased staffing and benefits  staff travel and profit sharing provision  offset by decreased professional fees due to a deferral in the implementation of sox section compliance 
operating income for the year ended march  was  a  reduction from fiscal  resulting from changes in both the ground equipment and air cargo sectors 
in the fiscal year ended march   global had operating income of  a decrease compared to fiscal operating income of  global s fiscal operating income decreased compared to fiscal primarily due to higher levels of commercial equipment orders in  which more than offset the  in cost associated with the repair of deicing booms in philadelphia 
operating income for the company s overnight air cargo operations was  in the fiscal year ended march   an increase of from  in fiscal the increase in air cargo operating income was due to fedex s decision to modernize the aircraft fleet being operated by mac under dry lease agreements by replacing older fokker f aircraft with newer atr and atr aircraft 
mac s administrative fees which are based on the number of aircraft operated in active or stand by service  although adversely affected in fiscal as a result of delays in the introduction of newer atr aircraft which were not received in time to replace the older fokker f aircraft that were removed from service as they neared major scheduled maintenance  increased in fiscal as the atr aircraft entered revenue service 
f revenue routes  affected by the delayed introduction of the atr s  were temporarily flown in fiscal by standby mac and csa aircraft or wet lease aircraft 
mac  which had been engaged to assist in the certification and conversion of atr aircraft from passenger to cargo configuration and had experienced a substantial increase in maintenance revenue in fiscal  experienced a decrease in maintenance revenue in fiscal due to the completion of work once the aircraft were placed in revenue service 
the majority of these conversion activities  a portion of which represents cost of aircraft parts  have been billed to the customer without mark up 
non operating expense was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal interest expense was  higher in fiscal related to increased borrowings on the company s bank line 
this increase was partly offset by a  increase in interest earned on investments 
income tax expense of  in fiscal represented an effective tax rate of  which included a reduction associated with a true up of deferred tax assets in the prior fiscal year 
income tax expense of  in fiscal represented an effective tax rate of  which represented the combined federal and state statutory tax rates 
net earnings was  or per diluted share for the year ended march   a decline from  or per diluted share in fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of march   the company s working capital amounted to  an increase of  compared to march  the net increase primarily resulted from an increase in inventories and cash and cash equivalents  partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable  as discussed further below 
in august  the company amended its  secured long term revolving credit line to extend its expiration date to august  the revolving credit line contains customary events of default  a subjective acceleration clause and restrictive covenants that  among other matters  require the company to maintain certain financial ratios 
there is no requirement for the company to maintain a lock box arrangement under this agreement 
as of march   the company was in compliance with all of the restrictive covenants 
the amount of credit available to the company under the agreement at any given time is determined by an availability calculation  based on the eligible borrowing base  as defined in the credit agreement  which includes the company s outstanding receivables  inventories and equipment  with certain exclusions 
at march    was available under the terms of the credit facility 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
amounts advanced under the credit facility bear interest at the day libor rate plus basis points 
the libor rate at march  was 
at march  and there were no outstanding loan balances 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates on its line of credit 
although the line had no outstanding balance at march  and  the line of credit did have a weighted average balance outstanding of approximately  during the year ended march  if the libor interest rate had been increased by one percentage point  based on the weighted average balance outstanding for the year  annual interest expense would have increased by approximately  in march  the company utilized its revolving credit line to acquire a corporate aircraft for  in april  the company refinanced the aircraft under a secured fixed rate five year term loan  based on a ten year amortization with a balloon payment at the end of the fifth year 
the company assumes various financial obligations and commitments in the normal course of its operations and financing activities 
financial obligations are considered to represent known future cash payments that the company is required to make under existing contractual arrangements such as debt and lease agreements 
the following table of material contractual obligations at march  summarizes the effect these obligations are expected to have on the company s cash flow in the future periods  as discussed below 
contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term bank debt operating leases capital leases deferred retirement obligation total the following is a table of changes in cash flow for the respective years ended march   and  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash cash provided by operating activities was  more for fiscal compared to fiscal an increase in net earnings in fiscal and an executive retirement obligation of  paid in fiscal were significant components of the increase 
in addition  accounts receivable decreased and inventories increased from fiscal accounts receivable have decreased as a significant portion of fourth quarter sales were to the military with favorable payment terms to the company 
inventories have increased to meet product demand and to take advantage of strategic purchase opportunities 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal was approximately  less than fiscal  due to decreased capital expenditures in the current year 
cash used by financing activities was  more in fiscal compared to fiscal principally due to the stock repurchase program initiated by the company in december during the fiscal year ended march  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock for  including a commission of 
per share 
no stock repurchases were made in fiscal during the fiscal year ended march  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock for  as described following  under resignation of executive officer 
there are currently no commitments for significant capital expenditures 
the company s board of directors  on august   adopted the policy to pay an annual cash dividend in the first quarter of each fiscal year  in an amount to be determined by the board

the company is not currently engaged in the use of any of the arrangements defined above 
impact of inflation the company believes that the recent increases in inflation have not had a material effect on its manufacturing operations  because increased costs to date have been passed on to its customers 
under the terms of its air cargo business contracts the major cost components of its operations  consisting principally of fuel  crew and other direct operating costs  and certain maintenance costs are reimbursed  without markup by its customer 
significant increases in inflation rates could  however  have a material impact on future revenue and operating income 
resignation of executive officer effective december   an executive officer and director of the company resigned his employment 
in consideration of approximately  payable in three installments over a one year period starting january   the executive agreed to forgo certain retirement and other contractual benefits for which the company had previously accrued aggregate liabilities of  the company also agreed to purchase from the former executive officer  shares of airt common stock held by him representing approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock at december  for per share of the january  closing price 
the stock repurchase took place in three installments over a one year period  starting january   and totaled approximately  the repurchase of the former executive s stock was recorded in the period that the repurchase occurred 
as of march  all payments required to be made under the above agreements had been made 
seasonality global s business has historically been seasonal 
the company has continued its efforts to reduce global s seasonal fluctuation in revenues and earnings by increasing military and international sales and broadening its product line to increase revenues and earnings throughout the year 
in june  global was awarded a four year contract to supply deicing equipment to the united states air force  and global has been awarded two three year extensions on the contract 
although sales remain somewhat seasonal  this diversification has lessened the seasonal impacts and allowed the company to be more efficient in its planning and production 
the air cargo segment of business has no susceptibility to seasonality
