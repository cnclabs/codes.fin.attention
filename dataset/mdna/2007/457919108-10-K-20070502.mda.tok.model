competition in the hotel industry the hotel industry is highly competitive 
each of the hotels experiences competition primarily from other mid market hotels located in its immediate vicinity  but also competes with hotel properties located in other geographic markets 
while none of the hotels competitors dominate any of the trust s geographic markets  some of those competitors have greater marketing and financial resources than the trust 
certain additional hotel property developments have been announced or have recently been completed by competitors in a number of the hotels markets  and additional hotel property developments may be built in the future 
such hotel developments have had  and could continue to have  an adverse effect on the revenue of the hotels in their respective markets 
the trust has chosen to focus its hotel investments in the southwest region of the united states 
the trust has a concentration of assets in southern arizona market 
in the markets in which the trust operates  supply and demand rates have generally been balanced 
the trust may also compete for investment opportunities with other entities that have greater financial resources 
these entities also may generally accept more risk than the trust can prudently manage 
competition may generally reduce the number of suitable future investment opportunities available to the trust and increase the bargaining power of owners seeking to sell their properties 
seasonality of the hotel business the hotels operations historically have been seasonal 
the three southern arizona hotels experience their highest occupancy in the first fiscal quarter and  to a lesser extent  the fourth fiscal quarter 
the second fiscal quarter tends to be the lowest occupancy period at those three southern arizona hotels 
this seasonality pattern can be expected to cause fluctuations in the trust s quarterly revenues 
the two hotels located in california and new mexico historically experience their most profitable periods during the second and third fiscal quarters the summer season  providing some balance to the general seasonality of the hotel business

item a 
risk factors the material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below 
you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations 
this annual report on form k is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur to any significant extent  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if this were to happen  the value of our shares of beneficial interest could decline  perhaps significantly  and you could lose part or all of your investment 
we are subject to operating risks common in the hospitality industry 
our business is subject  directly or through our franchisors  to the following risks common in the hospitality industry  among others changes in occupancy and room rates achieved by our hotels and by competitive area hotels  desirability of a hotel s geographic location and changes in traffic patterns  changes in general and local economic and market conditions  which can adversely affect the level of business and leisure travel  and therefore the demand for lodging and related services  changes in the number of hotels operating under specific franchised brands  increases in costs due to inflation may not be able to be totally offset by increases in room rates  over building in one or more sectors of the hotel industry and or in one or more geographic regions  could lead to excess supply compared to demand  and to decreases in hotel occupancy and or room rates  changes in travel patterns and travel costs affected by fuel prices  changes in governmental regulations that influence or determine wages  prices or construction costs  other unpredictable external factors  such as natural disasters  war  terrorist attacks  epidemics  airline strikes  transportation and fuel price increases and severe weather  may reduce business and leisure travel  the need to periodically repair and renovate our hotels at a cost in excess of our standard reserve  increases in the cost of labor  energy  healthcare  insurance and other operating expenses resulting in lower operating margins  the financial condition of franchisors and travel related companies  our ability to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential franchisors  and our ability to develop our own regional innsuites brand 
changes in any of these conditions could adversely impact hotel room demand and pricing and result in reduced occupancy and revenue which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we have a limited ability to pass through increased operating costs in the form of higher room rates  so that such increased costs could result in lower operating margins 
the hotel industry is highly competitive 
each of the hotels experiences competition primarily from other mid market hotels in its immediate vicinity  but also competes with other hotel properties in its geographic market 
some of the competitors of the hotels have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than us 
a number of additional hotel rooms have been added  are under development or have been announced in a number of our markets  and additional hotel rooms may be developed in the future 
such additional hotel rooms have had  and may continue to have  an adverse effect on the revenues of the hotels in such markets 
we may be competing for investment opportunities with entities that have substantially greater financial resources than us 
these entities may generally be able to accept more risk than we prudently can manage 
competition may generally reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us and increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell hotel properties 
we have concentrated our marketing resources on the innsuites hotels brand 
all of the hotels are marketed as innsuites hotels  a southwestern us regional brand owned by the trust 
accordingly  we are subject to risks inherent in concentrating our investments in the innsuites hotels brand  such as a reduction in business following adverse publicity related to the brand  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  many of our hotels are co branded as best western hotels 
this brand is owned by its members and faces the same risks on an international scale 
we have engaged in  and may continue to engage in  transactions involving mr 
wirth 
these transactions pose conflict of interest issues for us 
a number of our prior transactions have involved dealings with mr 
wirth  our founder  largest shareholder and chief executive officer 
we may also engage in similar transactions with mr 
wirth in the future 
because of the direct and indirect ownership interests of mr 
wirth in  and his positions with  the trust and its affiliates  there were  and will continue to be  inherent conflicts of interest in connection with our acquisition or disposition of hotels from or to mr 
wirth or other transactions  such as loans from rare earth financial llc  an affiliate of mr 
wirth  or the condo hotel conversions  in which mr 
wirth has a significant interest 
accordingly  our management may have considered  and may in the future consider  their own interests above the interests of our other shareholders while negotiating these transactions 
except as specifically provided in our governing documents or in certain provisions of ohio law  nothing prohibits our officers and trustees from engaging in business activities for their own account 
as a general principle of law  however  officers and trustees owe fiduciary duties to the shareholders of each company they represent 
those duties require them to deal with each company fairly 
additionally  all decisions involving the potential for conflict must be approved by a majority of trustees who do not have an interest in the transaction 
we cannot guarantee  however  that the independent trustees will resolve all decisions involving conflict in favor of the trust 
certain affiliates of the trust  including mr 
wirth  may have unrealized gain in their investments in certain hotels acquired by us on january  a subsequent sale of these hotels by us may cause adverse tax consequences to such persons 
therefore  the interests of the trust and certain of its affiliates  including mr 
wirth  could be in opposition in connection with the disposition of any of these hotels 
however  decisions with respect to the disposition of any of these hotels must be approved by a majority of the independent trustees 
we have significant debt obligations 
at january   our outstanding debt and capital lease obligations consisted of approximately million in principal amount outstanding 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our present or future debt service obligations and  to the extent that we cannot  we risk the loss of some or all of our assets to foreclosure 
adverse economic conditions could cause the terms on which borrowings are available to become unfavorable to us 
in such circumstances  if we are in need of capital to repay indebtedness in accordance with its terms or otherwise  we could be required to liquidate one or more investments in the hotels at times that may not permit realization of the maximum return on our investments 
we rely on key personnel 
our future success is substantially dependent on the active participation of our executive officers  mr 
wirth  mr 
waters and mr 
berg 
in addition  mr 
bauer  controller  and mr 
green  director of operations  hold key positions with the trust 
the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on us 
under certain circumstances  our franchisors may terminate our franchise contracts 
the continuation of our franchise contracts for the hotels is subject to the maintenance of specified operating standards and other terms and conditions  and our best western franchise agreements are renewable annually 
our failure to maintain those operating standards or adhere to the other terms and conditions of the franchise contracts could result in the loss or cancellation of such franchise contracts 
it is possible that a franchisor could condition the continuation of a franchise contract upon the completion of substantial capital improvements  which the board of trustees may determine to be too expensive or otherwise unwarranted in light of general economic conditions or the operating results or prospects of the affected hotel 
failure to complete improvements  when required  in a manner satisfactory to the franchisor could result in the cancellation of one or more franchise contracts 
in any case  if a franchise contract is terminated  we may seek to obtain a suitable replacement franchise  or to operate the affected hotel independent of a franchise contract 
in addition  we may desire to operate additional hotels under franchise contracts  and such franchisors may require that significant capital expenditures be made at such hotels as a condition of granting a franchise contract 
the loss or lack of a franchise contract could have a material adverse effect upon the operations or the underlying value of the hotel covered by such contract because of the loss of associated name recognition  marketing support and centralized reservation systems provided by the franchisor 
the loss of a number of the franchise contracts for the hotels could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
due to the geographic concentration of the hotels in our system  our results of operations and financial condition are subject to fluctuations in regional economic conditions 
all of our hotels are located in the southwestern united states 
therefore  our results of operations and financial condition may be significantly affected by the economy of this region 
other adverse events affecting the southwestern united states  such as economic recessions or natural disasters  could cause a loss of revenues for our hotels in this region  which may be greater as a result of our concentration of assets in these areas 
our expenses may remain constant even if revenues decline 
the expenses of owning property have some flexibility but are not necessarily materially reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from a hotel 
accordingly  a decrease in our revenues could result in a disproportionately higher decrease in our earnings because our expenses are unlikely to decrease proportionately or as rapidly 
in such instances  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected  not only by changes in occupancy rates  but also by fixed labor costs  interest rate levels  the availability of financing  increases in real property tax rates  the cost of compliance with government regulations  including zoning and tax laws  and changes in government regulations  including those governing usage  zoning and taxes 
our inability to sell real estate if and when desired may adversely affect our financial condition 
real estate assets generally cannot be sold quickly 
in general  we may not be able to vary our portfolio of hotels or other real estate promptly in response to economic or other conditions 
this inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our assets could adversely affect our financial condition 
in addition  sales of appreciated real property could generate material adverse tax consequences  which may make it disadvantageous for us to sell certain of our hotels 
we are exploring strategic alternatives for the trust  including the possible sale of some or all of the hotels  however we cannot provide assurance that any transactions will be successfully completed  that our financial results will not be adversely effected by the potential loss of management and or trademark licensing revenue or that the pursuit of these strategic alternatives will have a positive effect on our share price 
the board of trustees is evaluating potential strategic alternatives  including the sale of some or all of the hotels 
this process may or may not result in an agreement to sell some or all of the hotels 
in addition  the trust s ability to complete a sale of any of the hotels  if the board of trustees decides to pursue such a strategy  will depend on numerous factors  some of which are outside the trust s control 
if any or all of the hotels were sold  our future management and or licensing fees could be reduced if the purchaser did not continue to retain us to provide those services 
such a reduction could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
there are various uncertainties and risks relating to the exploration of strategic alternatives  including diversion of management resources  the process may be time consuming and expensive and may result in the loss of business opportunities  the trust may not be able to successfully achieve the benefits of any strategic alternatives  and perceived uncertainties as to the trust s future direction may result in increased difficulties in recruiting and retaining employees  particularly senior management 
even if a transaction is completed  there can be no assurance that it will have a positive effect on the price of the trust s shares of beneficial interest 
the market price of the trust s shares of beneficial interest could be highly volatile during the period while the board of trustees explores strategic alternatives and may continue to be more volatile if the trust announces the sale of one of its hotels 
we may not have sufficient resources to pursue our current strategies 
we may pursue a growth strategy  which includes acquiring  repositioning and improving hotel properties  and may also pursue a strategy of converting some of our hotels into condo hotel units 
we also plan to pursue a strategy of increased licensing of the innsuites hotels brand 
there is a risk that  due to market and other conditions beyond our control  we will not have access to sufficient equity or debt capital to pursue these strategies 
since the term and amount of our credit arrangements are limited  our ability to continue to pursue these strategies may depend on our ability to obtain additional private or public equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing is or will be available on acceptable terms when necessary 
we are subject to governmental regulations affecting the hospitality industry  the costs of complying with governmental regulations  or our failure to comply with such regulations  could affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to numerous federal  state and local government laws and regulations affecting the hospitality industry  including usage  building and zoning requirements 
a violation of any of those laws and regulations or increased government regulation could require us to make unplanned expenditures and result in higher operating costs 
in addition  our success in expanding our hotel operations or engaging in condo hotel conversions depends upon our ability to obtain necessary building permits and zoning variances from local authorities 
compliance with these laws is time intensive and costly and may reduce our revenues and operating income 
under the americans with disabilities act of the ada  all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
in addition to ada work to date  we may be required to remove access barriers or make unplanned  substantial modifications to our hotels to comply with the ada or to comply with other changes in governmental rules and regulations  which could reduce the number of total available rooms  increase operating costs and have a negative impact on our results of operations 
any failure to comply with ada requirements or other governmental regulations could result in the us government imposing fines or in private litigants winning damage awards against us 
our hotels  like all real property  are subject to governmental regulations designed to protect the environment 
however  if we fail to comply with such laws and regulations  we may become subject to significant liabilities  fines and or penalties  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we are also subject to laws governing our relationship with employees  including minimum or living wage requirements  overtime  working conditions and work permit requirements 
an increase in the state or federal minimum wage rate  employee benefit costs or other costs associated with employees could increase expenses and result in lower operating margins 
although none of our employees are currently represented by labor unions  labor union organizing activities may take place at our existing hotels or at any new hotel property we open 
a lengthy strike or other work stoppage at one of our hotels  or the threat of such activity  could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
if we fail to comply with privacy regulations  we could be subject to fines or other restrictions on our business 
we collect and maintain information relating to our guests for various business purposes  including maintaining guest preferences to enhance our customer service and for marketing and promotion purposes 
the collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations 
compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and or adversely impact our ability to service our guests and market our products  properties and services to our guests 
in addition  non compliance with applicable privacy regulations by us or in some circumstances non compliance by third parties engaged by us could result in fines or restrictions on our use or transfer of data 
increasing use of internet reservation channels may decrease loyalty to our brands or otherwise adversely affect us 
as is the case with many other hotel operators  a growing percentage of our hotel rooms are booked through internet travel intermediaries 
if such bookings continue to increase  these intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions  reduced room rates or other significant contract concessions from our franchisors or us 
moreover  some of these internet travel intermediaries are attempting to commoditize hotel rooms  by increasing the importance of price and general indicators of quality at the expense of brand identification 
these intermediaries hope that consumers will eventually develop brand loyalties to their reservations systems rather than to our lodging brands 
if this happens our business and profitability may be significantly harmed 
our business is seasonal in nature  and we are likely to experience fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition 
our business is seasonal in nature  with the first and fourth fiscal quarters generally accounting for a greater portion of annual revenues than the second and third fiscal quarters 
therefore  our results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 
the seasonal nature of our business increases our vulnerability to risks such as labor force shortages and cash flow problems 
further  if an adverse event such as an actual or threatened terrorist attack  international conflict  regional economic downturn or poor weather conditions should occur during the first or fourth fiscal quarters  the adverse impact to our revenues could likely be greater as a result of our southern arizona seasonal business 
our properties are subject to risks relating to natural disasters  terrorist activity and war and any such event could materially adversely affect our operating results 
our financial and operating performance may be adversely affected by natural disasters particularly in locations where we own significant properties 
some types of losses  such as those from earthquake  wild fires  terrorism or environmental hazards  may be either uninsurable or too expensive to justify insuring against 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property 
in that event  we might nevertheless remain obligated for any financial obligations related to the property 
inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations and other factors also might make it impractical to rely on insurance proceeds to replace property after that property has been damaged or destroyed 
under those circumstances  the insurance proceeds received by us might not be adequate to restore our economic position with respect to such property 
similarly  war including the potential for war and terrorist activity including threats of terrorist activity  epidemics such as sars and bird flu  travel related accidents  as well as geopolitical uncertainty and international conflict  which impact domestic and international travel  may cause our results to differ materially from anticipated results 
terrorism incidents such as the events of september  and wars such as the ongoing iraq war significantly impact travel and tourism and consequently the demand for hotel rooms 
hospitality companies have been the target of class actions and other lawsuits alleging violations of federal and state law 
our operating income and profits may be reduced by legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of our employees or customers 
in recent years  a number of hospitality companies have been subject to lawsuits  including class action lawsuits  alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters  discrimination and similar matters 
a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants 
we cannot assure you that we will not incur substantial damages and expenses resulting from lawsuits of this type  which could have a material adverse effect on our business

four of our hotels are branded through franchise agreements with best western 
all five hotels are trademarked as innsuites hotels 
we are also involved in various operations incidental to the operation of hotels  such as the operation of restaurants and meeting banquet room rentals 
our operations consist of one reportable segment  hotel ownership  which derives its revenue from the operation of the hotels 
in addition  we receive management fees  trademark license fees and reservation fees 
our results are significantly affected by occupancy and room rates at the hotels  our ability to manage costs  and changes in the number of available suites caused by acquisition and disposition activities 
results are also significantly impacted by overall economic conditions and conditions in the travel industry 
unfavorable changes in these factors could negatively impact hotel room demand and pricing which would reduce our profit margins on rented suites 
additionally  our ability to manage costs could be adversely impacted by significant increases in operating expenses  resulting in lower operating margins 
improved economic conditions  both generally and specifically in the travel industry  had a positive impact on the operations of the trust in fiscal year we anticipate the positive trend in the travel industry to continue in better overall economic conditions are expected to result in increased business and leisure travel and support higher room rates  and therefore higher operating margins 
we expect the major challenge for fiscal year to be strong competition for group business in the markets in which we operate that may affect the trust s ability to increase room rates while maintaining market share 
we believe that we have positioned the hotels to remain competitive through selective refurbishment and carrying a relatively large number of two room suites at each location 
effective february   the trust relinquished its reit status 
as of that date  any distributions to its shareholders are not deductible for purposes of computing the trust s taxable income and the trust will be subject to income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on its taxable income at regular corporate rates  without offset for distributions of such income to its shareholders 
as of january   the trust has million in federal net loss carryforwards available to offset future federal tax liability and million in state net loss carryforwards 
general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the trust s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
the accounting policies that we believe are most critical and involve the most subjective judgments include our estimates and assumptions of future revenue and expenditures used to project hotel cash flows 
future cash flows are used in the valuation calculation of our hotel properties to determine the recoverability or impairment of the carrying amounts in the event management is required to test the asset for recoverability of its carrying value under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated future cash flows over its estimated remaining life  the trust recognizes an impairment expense to reduce the asset s carrying value to its fair value 
fair value is determined by either the most current third party property appraisal  if available  or the present value of future undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the asset 
our evaluation of future cash flows is based on our historical experience and other factors  including certain economic conditions and committed future bookings 
see critical accounting policies and estimates below 
at january  and  the trust owned a and  respectively  interest in four of the hotels through its sole general partner s interest in the partnership and owned a interest in one hotel 
the trust purchased   and  partnership units during the years ended january   and  respectively 
prior to may   the partnership leased its hotel properties to innsuites hotels 
the corresponding rent expense for innsuites hotels and rent revenue for the partnership  as well as the resulting rent receivable and payable  eliminate in consolidation 
on may   the percentage lease agreements between the partnership and innsuites hotels were terminated 
the expenses of the trust consist primarily of property taxes  insurance  corporate overhead  interest on mortgage debt  professional fees  depreciation of the hotels and hotel operating expenses 
under the terms of its partnership agreement  the partnership is required to reimburse the trust for all such expenses 
accordingly  management believes that a review of the historical performance of the operations of the hotels  particularly with respect to occupancy  which is calculated as rooms sold divided by total rooms available  average daily rate adr  calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms sold  and revenue per available room revpar  calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms available  is appropriate for understanding revenue from the hotels 
occupancy increased to from in the prior year 
adr increased by to in fiscal year from in fiscal year these increases resulted in an increase in revpar of to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the following table shows certain historical financial and other information for the periods indicated for the year ended january  occupancy average daily rate adr revenue per available room revpar no assurance can be given that the trends reflected in this data will continue or that occupancy  adr and revpar will not decrease as a result of changes in national or local economic or hospitality industry conditions

the partnership s principal source of revenue is hotel operations for the four hotel properties it owns 
the trust s liquidity  including its ability to make distributions to its shareholders  will depend upon the ability of itself and the partnership to generate sufficient cash flow from hotel operations 
hotel operations are significantly affected by occupancy and room rates at the hotels  which have improved over the prior three fiscal years  our ability to manage costs  and changes in the number of available suites caused by acquisition and disposition activities 
results are also significantly impacted by overall economic conditions and conditions in the travel industry 
unfavorable changes in these factors could negatively impact hotel room demand and pricing which would reduce our profit margins on rented suites 
we anticipate that better overall economic conditions will result in increased business and leisure travel and support higher room rates  and therefore higher operating margins 
challenges in fiscal year are expected to include continued competition for group business in the markets in which we operate and the trust s ability to increase room rates while maintaining market share 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million   and  for the years ended january   and  respectively 
the increases during the three year period were primarily due to increased operating income due to better hotel performance 
net cash used in provided by investing activities totaled million   and million for the years ended january   and  respectively 
the decrease in as compared to was a result of the proceeds from the disposition of the phoenix  az hotel in fiscal year the decrease in as compared to was due to fewer dispositions during fiscal year net cash used in financing activities totaled   and million for the years ended january   and  respectively 
the decrease in as compared to was primarily due to the san diego mortgage payoff in fiscal year the trust received  in proceeds from the sale of the furniture  fixtures and equipment at the san diego  california property 
the trust did not sell these items as part of the sale of the hotel during fiscal year the trust received million in proceeds from the sales of hotel properties in fiscal year the trust used these proceeds to fund operations and capital improvements 
the trust received million in proceeds for the sales of hotel properties in fiscal year the trust used million of these proceeds to satisfy a mortgage note payable  million to satisfy related party notes and interest payable  and retained the remaining proceeds to reduce trade payables and to fund future operations and capital improvements 
as of january   the trust has no commitments for capital expenditures beyond a reserve for refurbishment and replacements that is set aside annually  as described below 
the trust is obligated under loan agreements relating to four of its hotels to deposit of the individual hotel s room revenue into an escrow account to be used for capital expenditures 
these accounts are restricted by the mortgage lenders 
as of january    was held in these accounts and is reported on the trust s consolidated balance sheet as restricted cash 
the accounts are required to be used for capital improvements to the hotels and refurbishment and replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
during the twelve months ended january  and  the hotels spent approximately million and million  respectively  for capital expenditures 
the trust considers the majority of these improvements to be revenue producing 
therefore  these amounts have been capitalized and are being depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
the trust plans to spend approximately  for capital expenditures in fiscal year the hotels also spent approximately and million during fiscal years and  respectively  on repairs and maintenance and these amounts have been charged to expense as incurred 
the trust has minimum debt payments of million and million due during fiscal years and  respectively 
on february   tucson st 
mary s suite hospitality  an entity owned by the partnership  established a million non revolving line of credit 
the unpaid principal balance bears interest at the prime rate  as published in the wall street journal  plus currently and is secured by a second mortgage on the tucson st 
mary s hotel 
the line of credit matures on february  as of april   million was drawn on the line of credit and used to pay down debt and to pay for renovations to that hotel 
the trust believes it can satisfy its remaining obligations during fiscal years and using revenue generated by the hotels operations 
management believes that cash on hand  future cash receipts from operations  and borrowings from affiliates in fiscal year will be sufficient to meet the trust s obligations as they become due for the next twelve months 
the trust may seek to negotiate additional credit facilities or issue debt instruments 
any debt incurred or issued by the trust may be secured or unsecured  long term  medium term or short term  bear interest at a fixed or variable rate and be subject to such other terms as the trust considers prudent 
the trust will acquire or develop additional hotels only as suitable opportunities arise  and the trust will not undertake acquisition or redevelopment of properties unless adequate sources of financing are available 
funds for future acquisitions or development of hotels are expected to be derived  in whole or in part  from borrowings or from the proceeds of additional issuances of shares of beneficial interest or other securities 
however  there can be no assurance that the trust will successfully acquire or develop additional hotels or that proceeds from borrowings or issuances of shares of beneficial interest will be available or in amounts and on terms sufficient to allow such transactions 
future positioning the board of trustees is exploring potential strategic alternatives  including the possibility of selling some or all of the hotels 
in addition  the trust has been informed by mr 
wirth that one of the four hotels owned by his affiliates for which the trust provides management and trademark licensing services has been listed for sale with a real estate broker and that the three remaining hotels owned by his affiliates may also be listed for sale 
if any or all of these properties were sold  the trust s future management and or licensing fees could be reduced if the purchaser did not continue to retain innsuites hotels to provide those services 
in the past  when the trust has sold hotel properties to unrelated third parties  the trust has continued to provide management and or trademark licensing services after a sale  although there can be no assurance that the trust will be able to successfully do so in the future 
management believes that the market value of each of the trust s hotels exceeds that hotel s net book value and outstanding debt  and the trust intends to sell a hotel only if the sale price were to exceed the hotel s net book value and outstanding debt 
such a sale would result in a profit to the extent the sale price exceeded the net book value and cash flow to the extent the sale price exceeded the outstanding debt 
the cash generated from any hotel sales will be used initially to reduce the trust s outstanding debt 
the trust will list its yuma  arizona hotel for sale with a real estate broker in may the trust can provide no assurances that it will be able to sell the yuma  arizona hotel or any of its other hotels or that  if the trust did sell a hotel  that it would be able to sell the hotel at the advertised listing price 
in addition  in connection with any real estate sales the trust will incur real estate commissions and other closing costs 
management continues to explore the condo hotel concept as an opportunity for the trust 
share repurchase program on january   the board of trustees approved a share repurchase program under rule b of the securities exchange act of  as amended  for the purchase of up to  limited partnership units in the partnership and or shares of beneficial interest in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
additionally  on september   the board of trustees approved the purchase of up to  additional limited partnership units in the partnership and or shares of beneficial interest in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
on august   the board of trustees approved the purchase of up to  additional limited partnership units in the partnership and or shares of beneficial interest in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
acquired shares of beneficial interest will be held in treasury and will be available for future acquisitions and financings and or for awards granted under the innsuites hospitality trust stock incentive and option plan 
during fiscal year  the trust acquired  shares of beneficial interest in open market transactions at an average price of per share and  shares of beneficial interest in privately negotiated transactions at an average price of 
the trust intends to continue repurchasing shares of beneficial interest in compliance with applicable legal and american stock exchange requirements

these agreements provide for fees to be paid by innsuites hotels based on revenues and reservations received  and contain no minimum payment provisions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the trust believes that the policies it follows for the valuation of its hotel properties  which constitute the majority of trust assets  are its most critical policies 
the trust applies sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to determine when it is necessary to test an asset for recoverability 
on an events and circumstances basis  the trust reviews the carrying value of its hotel properties both held for use and held for sale 
the trust will record an impairment loss and reduce the carrying value of a property when anticipated undiscounted future cash flows and or a current appraisal of the property do not support its carrying value 
in cases where the trust does not expect to recover the carrying cost of hotel properties held for use  it will reduce the carrying value to the fair value of the hotel  as determined by a current appraisal 
in cases where the trust does not expect to recover the carrying cost of hotel properties held for sale  it will reduce the carrying value to the sales price less costs to sell 
the trust did not recognize impairment expense in fiscal years  or as of january   the trust management does not believe that the carrying values of any of its hotel properties are impaired

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the trust is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its mortgage notes payable  notes payable to banks  other notes payable and notes and advances payable to related parties 
the proceeds from these loans were used to maintain liquidity  fund capital expenditures and expand the trust s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the trust s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the trust borrows using fixed rate debt  when possible 
the trust could enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
to date  the trust has not entered into any such derivative transactions
