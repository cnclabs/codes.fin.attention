overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapeutics for diseases that affect the central nervous system 
a number of drug development programs are currently being conducted to evaluate our drug candidates in diseases such as bipolar disorder and neurodegeneration 
in addition  we sell two commercial products  protein a for monoclonal antibody purification and secreflo for assessment of pancreatic disorders 
in fiscal  we experienced growth in sales and profits from our commercial products business 
our business strategy is to deploy the profits from our current commercial products and any revenue that we may receive from our patents to enable us to invest in the development of our product candidates in the treatment area of neurological diseases while reducing our financial risk 
critical accounting policies and estimates while our significant accounting polices are more fully described in notes to our financial statements  we have identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
revenue recognition we apply staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab no 
to our revenue arrangements 
we generate product revenues from the sale of our protein a products to customers in the pharmaceutical and process chromatography industries and from the sale of secreflo to hospital based gastroenterologists 
in accordance with sab no 
 we recognize revenue related to product sales upon delivery of the product to the customer as long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
determination of whether these criteria have been met are based on management s judgments primarily regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for product delivered  and the collectibility of those fees 
we have a few longstanding customers who comprise the majority of our revenue and have excellent payment history 
we have had no significant write offs of uncollectible invoices in the periods presented 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine that these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 

table of contents at the time of sale  we also evaluate the need to accrue for warranty and sales returns 
the supply agreements we have with our customers and related purchase orders identify the terms and conditions of each sale and the price of the goods ordered 
due to the nature of our sales arrangements  inventory produced for sale is tested for quality specifications prior to shipment 
since the product is manufactured to order and in compliance with required specifications prior to shipment  the likelihood of sales return  warranty or other issues is largely diminished 
sales returns and warranty issues are infrequent and have had nominal impact on our financial statements historically 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine that warranty  returns or other sale related reserves are necessary for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
during the fiscal years ended march  and march   we recognized  and  respectively of revenue from a sponsored research and development project under an agreement with the stanley medical research institute smri 
research revenue is recognized on a cost plus fixed fee basis when the expense has been incurred and services have been performed 
determination of which costs incurred qualify for reimbursement under the terms of our contractual agreement and the timing of when such costs were incurred involves the judgment of management 
our calculations are based upon the agreed upon terms as stated in our arrangement 
however  should our estimated calculations change or be challenged by smri  research revenue may be adjusted in subsequent periods 
our calculations have not historically changed or been challenged and we do not anticipate any subsequent change in our revenue related to this sponsored research and development project 
additionally  during fiscal years and  the company earned and recognized approximately  and  respectively in royalty revenue from chirhoclin 
revenues earned from chirhoclin royalties are recorded in the periods when they are earned based on royalty reports sent by chirhoclin to the company 
there have been no material changes to our initial estimates related to revenue recognition in any periods presented in the accompanying financial statements 
inventories inventories relate to our protein a business 
we value inventory at cost or  if lower  fair market value 
we determine cost using the first in  first out method 
we review our inventories at least quarterly and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on our estimates of expected sales volume  production capacity and expiration dates of raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
expected sales volumes are determined based on supply forecasts provided by our key customers for the next three to twelve months 
we write down inventory that has become obsolete  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value  and inventory in excess of expected requirements to cost of goods sold 
manufacturing of protein a finished goods is done to order and tested for quality specifications prior to shipment 
a change in the estimated timing or amount of demand for our products could result in additional provisions for excess inventory quantities on hand 
any significant unanticipated changes in demand or unexpected quality failures could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results 
during all periods presented in the accompanying financial statements  there has been no material adjustments related to a revised estimate of inventory valuations 
accrued liabilities we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these principles require that we estimate accrued liabilities 
this process involves identifying services  which have been performed on our behalf  and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date 
examples of estimated accrued expenses 
table of contents include fees paid to our contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical materials 
these expenses are normally determined through a contract or purchase order issued by the company  service fees paid to organizations for their performance in conducting our clinical trials 
these expenses are determined by contracts in place for those services and communications with project managers on costs which have been incurred as of each reporting date  and professional and consulting fees incurred with law firms  audit and accounting service providers and other third party consultants 
these expenses are determined by either requesting those service providers to estimate unbilled services at each reporting date for services incurred  or tracking costs incurred by service providers under fixed fee arrangements 
we have processes in place to estimate the appropriate amounts to record for accrued liabilities  which principally involve the applicable personnel reviewing the services provided 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs which have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for that period may be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services are often judgmental 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us at the date of the financial statements 
a change in the estimated cost or volume of services provided could result in additional accrued liabilities 
any significant unanticipated changes in such estimates could have a significant impact on our accrued liabilities and reported operating results 
there has been no material adjustments to our accrued liabilities in any of the periods presented in the accompanying financial statements 
stock based compensation effective april   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  or sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized in the statement of operations for the year ended march  includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of april   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted  modified or settled subsequent to april   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
effective with the adoption of sfas no 
r  we have elected to use the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of share based awards on the grant date 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time for which the options are expected to be outstanding and is derived from our historical stock option exercise experience and option expiration data 
for option grants made subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
r  the expected life of stock options granted is based on the simplified method allowable under sab no 
accordingly  the expected term is presumed to be the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
in addition  for purposes of estimating the expected term  we have aggregated all individual option awards into one group as we do not expect substantial differences in exercise behavior among its employees 
the expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the expected term of options granted 
we determined the expected volatility solely based upon the historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term 
we do not believe that the future volatility of our common stock over an option s expected term is likely to differ significantly from the past 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the option s expected term on the grant date 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on any of our capital stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we use an expected dividend yield of zero to calculate the grant date fair value of a stock option 
we recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period based upon options that are ultimately expected to vest  and accordingly  such compensation expense has been adjusted by an 
table of contents amount of estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures represent only the unvested portion of a surrendered option 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we accounted for forfeitures upon occurrence as permitted under sfas no 
based on an analysis of historical data  we have calculated an annual forfeiture rate for non director level employees  a annual forfeiture rate for director level employees  and a forfeiture rate for non employee members of the board of directors  which we believe is a reasonable assumption to estimate forfeitures 
however  the estimation of forfeitures requires significant judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
prior to april   we applied the pro forma disclosure requirements under sfas no 
and accounted for our stock based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb no 
and related interpretations 
accordingly  no stock based employee compensation cost was recognized in the statement of operations for the year ended march   as all stock options granted under our existing stock plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
for the year ended march   we recorded stock based compensation expense of approximately  for stock options granted under the amended and restated repligen corporation stock plan 
basic and diluted earnings per share amounts for the year ended march  were decreased by  as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r 
as of march   there was  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share based awards 
this cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining requisite service period of years 
the company expects approximately  of unvested outstanding options to vest over the next five years 
results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements and the related footnotes thereto 
revenues total revenue for fiscal  and were   and  revenues for the years ending march   and were primarily comprised of sales of our commercial products  protein a and secreflo 
during the fiscal year ended march   and sales of our commercial products were year ended march change vs 
vs 
in thousands  except percentages protein a secreflo other product revenue product revenue substantially all of our products based on recombinant protein a are sold to customers who incorporate our manufactured products into their proprietary antibody purification systems to be sold directly to the pharmaceutical industry 
monoclonal antibodies are a well established class of drug with applications in rheumatoid arthritis  asthma  crohn s disease and a variety of cancers 
sales of protein a are therefore impacted 
table of contents by the timing of large scale production orders and on the regulatory approvals for such antibodies  which may result in significant quarterly fluctuations 
during fiscal  protein a sales increased by  or over fiscal we shipped less volume of protein a in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in volume however did not reduce revenue compared to fiscal  as the mix of products sold had more favorable pricing resulting in a positive impact on total revenue 
the company sells different protein a products at different price points 
the mix of products sold varies and impacts the fluctuations in total sales revenue from year to year 
during fiscal  protein a sales increased by  or  primarily as a result of a rise in the demand for our protein a products 
the increase in sales volume of protein a resulted in an increase in revenues of 
this increase was slightly offset by a decrease in the total sales price of those products  which had an unfavorable impact of on total revenues 
we anticipate that sales of protein a will grow in the future and will continue to be subject to quarterly fluctuations due to timing of large scale production orders 
sales of secreflo decreased  or in fiscal primarily as a result of direct competition with crc  our sole supplier of secreflo and reduced sales and marketing efforts 
decreases in sales volume impacted sales by of the prior year s total 
to remain competitive with crc  we reduced sales prices  which resulted in an unfavorable impact of on secreflo revenues 
sales of secreflo decreased  or in fiscal primarily as a result of direct competition with our sole supplier of secreflo  the reduction of sales price to remain competitive and as a result of a reduction in sales and marketing efforts 
competition with our sole supplier of secreflo decreased the volume of secreflo vials sold  unfavorably impacting revenue by 
to remain competitive  we reduced sales prices  which caused an unfavorable impact of on secreflo revenues 
the settlement in fiscal with our sole supplier of secreflo provides for a certain amount of vials of product that we can ultimately ship 
the last shipment of secreflo to the company from chirhoclin should be in late calendar year and is expected to allow us to fill sales orders into fiscal year we expect secreflo revenues will decline by one third in fiscal as we continue to reduce sales and marketing efforts and focus our sales efforts on key customers 
during the fiscal year and  we recognized  and  respectively  of revenue from a sponsored research and development project under an agreement with the stanley medical research institute 
research revenue is recognized for costs plus fixed fee contracts as costs are incurred 
additionally  during fiscal year and  we earned and recognized approximately  and  respectively in royalty revenue from chirhoclin 
we expect that total research and license revenues will decline moderately in fiscal costs and operating expenses total costs and operating expenses for fiscal  and were approximately   and  respectively 
vs 
vs 
costs and operating expenses cost of product revenue research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses 
table of contents the increase in cost of product revenue of  or in fiscal is attributable to several factors 
these include an increase of  in consulting costs and a  increase in occupancy and depreciation costs 
consulting  occupancy and depreciation costs increased due to the costs associated with implementation of our fermentation facility in fiscal  as well as spending to improve our quality and redundancy systems to meet customer expectations 
additionally  we incurred  in stock based compensation expense pursuant to the adoption of sfas no 
r and had an increase in labor costs of  compared to fiscal these increases were off set by a decrease in protein a material costs of  related to lower volume of protein a production in fiscal compared to fiscal and lower costs of  related to secreflo sales 
the decrease in cost of product revenue of  or  in fiscal is attributable to a decrease in royalty and amortization fees of  associated with secreflo  partially offset by an increase of  in direct materials and increased personnel costs of  this reduction in secreflo related expenses is due to the settlement agreement in may of with chirhoclin 
the increase in direct material and personnel costs is a result of growth in production volume and a small increase in the number of employees in the manufacturing department to support the increase in volume of protein a 
research and development expenses for fiscal  and were approximately   and  respectively 
research and development costs primarily include costs of internal personnel  external research collaborations  clinical trials and the costs associated with the manufacturing and testing of clinical materials 
we currently have ongoing research and development programs that support our product candidates of secretin and uridine 
in addition  we are involved with a number of early stage programs that may or may not be further developed 
due to the small size of the company and the fact that these various programs share personnel and fixed costs such as facility costs  depreciation  and supplies  we do not track our expenses by program 
each of our research and development programs is subject to risks and uncertainties  including the requirement to seek regulatory approvals that are outside of our control 
for example  our clinical trials may be subject to delays based on our inability to enroll patients at the rate that we expect to meet the schedule for our planned clinical trials 
moreover  the product candidates identified in these research programs  particularly in our early stage programs must overcome significant technological  manufacturing and marketing challenges before they can be successfully commercialized 
for example  results from our preclinical animal models may not be replicated in our clinical trials with humans 
as a result of these risks and uncertainties  we are unable to predict with any certainty the period in which material net cash inflows from such projects could be expected to commence or the completion date of these programs 
these risks and uncertainties also prevent us from estimating with any certainty the specific timing and future costs of our research and development programs  although historical trends within the industry suggest that expenses tend to increase in later stages of development 
collaborations with commercial vendors and academic researchers accounted for   and of our research and development expenses in the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
the outsourcing of such services provides us flexibility to discontinue or increase spending depending on the success of our research and development programs 
research and development expenses increased by  or  during fiscal this increase is largely attributable to higher clinical trial expenses of  as the company enrolled the majority of the patients in our two clinical trial programs for uridine for bipolar disorder and secretin for diagnostic imaging 
additionally there were increased personnel expenses of  due to slightly higher headcount and the company incurred stock based compensation expense pursuant to the adoption of sfas no 
r in fiscal of  these increases were offset by reductions in external research expenses of  this was due to a reduction in activities related to secretin drug manufacturing compared to fiscal research and development expenses increased by  or  during fiscal this increase is largely attributable to higher clinical trial expenses of  as the company had two clinical trial programs 
table of contents in fiscal for uridine for bipolar disorder and secretin for diagnostic imaging that exceeded the clinical trial programs in fiscal which primarily consisted of the secretin for schizophrenia trial 
there were increased personnel expenses of  due to the addition of one clinical staff person to support the increase in clinical trials and increased license expenses of  due to a new license with another company for research materials for future clinical development 
these increased expenses were offset by decreased expenses associated with our external research of  due to decreased non recurring pharmacology studies on two of our research compounds 
clinical material expenses were relatively unchanged from fiscal to fiscal future research and development expenses are dependent on a number of variables  including the cost and design of clinical trials and external costs such as manufacturing of clinical materials 
we expect our research and development expenses in fiscal to increase due to clinical trial expenses as the company continues studies for secretin for diagnostic imaging  continues drug manufacturing activities for secretin and begins the friedreich s ataxia research and development program which was recently licensed by the company 
additionally  there may be further increases in expenses if we acquire additional product candidates 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include the associated costs with selling our commercial products and costs required to support our research and development efforts including legal  accounting  patent  shareholder services and other administrative functions 
in addition  sg a expenses have historically included costs associated with various litigation matters 
during fiscal  sg a costs increased by approximately  or 
this increase was mainly the result of the stock based compensation expense recorded pursuant to the adoption of sfas no 
r of  and personnel expenses which increased by  due to compensation and benefit increases 
investor relation expenses also increased  due to expanded outreach to the investment community 
legal expenses were consistent with fiscal as we continue to prosecute patent infringement lawsuits against bristol and imclone 
during fiscal  sg a costs increased by approximately  or 
this increase was partly the result of increased personnel expenses of  due to the addition of two senior managers to support our growing business 
additionally  professional expenses increased  related to recruiting expenses for the new senior management and increased external investor relations consulting for the company to expand awareness in the investor community 
legal expenses increased by  due to the company filing suit against bristol for patent infringement and continued expenses supporting the patent infringement suit against imclone 
we expect sg a expenses to increase in fiscal due to anticipated increases in litigation expenses for the bristol and imclone cases combined with higher headcount and the related personnel expenses 
investment income investment income includes income earned on invested cash balances 
investment income for fiscal  and was approximately   and  respectively 
the increase of  or is attributable to higher interest rates 
the increase of  or in fiscal is attributable to higher interest rates compared to fiscal we expect interest income to vary based on changes in the amount of funds invested and fluctuation of interest rates 
other income during the year ended march   repligen entered into a settlement agreement with chirhoclin  in full settlement of their arbitration proceedings 
as a result of the settlement  we determined that we were not required to pay approximately  of previously accrued but unremitted royalties to chirhoclin related to secreflo sales from february to march this amount  which was accrued at march   was reversed at the time of settlement and is recorded as other income in the fiscal year ended march  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities and revenues derived from product sales and grants 
our revenue for the foreseeable future will be limited to our product revenue related to protein a and secreflo 
revenues derived from the sales of secreflo vials are expected only through calendar year given the uncertainties related to pharmaceutical product development  we are currently unable to reliably estimate when  if ever  our therapeutic product candidates or our patents will generate revenue and cash flows 
at march   we had cash and marketable securities of  compared to  at march  deposits for leased office space of  is classified as restricted cash and is not included in cash and marketable securities total for either or cash flows in thousands year ended march  cash provided by used in increase decrease increase decrease operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities in fiscal  our operating activities provided cash of  which reflects a net loss of approximately  which includes non cash charges totaling approximately  including depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation charges 
the remaining cash flow from operations resulted from favorable changes in various working capital accounts 
in fiscal  our operating activities provided cash of  as a result of our net profit of  and non cash charges such as depreciation  amortization and stock compensation charges 
sources of cash included a decrease in accounts receivable of approximately  due to improved cash collections and a reduction in prepaid expenses of approximately  uses of cash included an increase in inventories of approximately  which was a result of purchases related to a manufacturing process conversion and a decrease in accrued liabilities of approximately  investing activities in fiscal  investing activities included capital spending of  mainly related to the new fermentation facility in waltham  massachusetts 
in fiscal  our purchases of property  plant and equipment were  of which  was financed through capital leases 
purchases and redemptions of marketable securities account for the remainder of the fluctuation during fiscal and fiscal we generally place our marketable security investments in high quality credit instruments as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
financing activities in fiscal  exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of  in fiscal  exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements 

table of contents contractual obligations as of march   we had the following fixed obligations and commitments payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations contractual obligations total the above amounts represent principal payments only while principal and interest are payable through a fixed monthly payment of approximately  and a fixed annual payment of  this amount represents minimum commitments due under a third party manufacturing agreement 
these amounts include payments for license  supply and consulting agreements 
capital requirements our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the success of our clinical studies  the scope of and progress made in our research and development activities  our ability to acquire additional product candidates  the success of any proposed financing efforts  and the ability to sustain sales and profits of our commercial products 
absent an acquisition of another product candidate  we believe our current cash balances are adequate to meet our cash needs for at least the next twenty four months 
we expect to incur an increased level of expense in fiscal compared to those incurred in fiscal this is due to anticipated increases in clinical study expenses and legal fees for litigation in process currently  as well as increased personnel expenses 
our future capital requirements include  but are not limited to  continued investment in our research and development programs  capital expenditures primarily associated with purchases of equipment and continued investment in our intellectual property portfolio 
we plan to continue to invest in key research and development activities 
we continue to seek to acquire such potential assets that may offer us the best opportunity to create value for our shareholders 
in order to acquire such assets  we may need to seek additional financing to fund these investments 
this may require the issuance or sale of additional equity or debt securities 
the sale of additional equity may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
should we need to secure additional financing to acquire a product  fund future investment in research and development  or meet our future liquidity requirements  we may not be able to secure such financing  or obtain such financing on favorable terms because of the volatile nature of the biotechnology marketplace 
net operating loss carryforwards at march   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and research and development credit carryforwards of approximately  to reduce future federal income taxes  if any 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards have expired and will continue to expire at various dates  beginning in fiscal year  if not used 
net operating loss carryforwards and available tax credits are subject 
table of contents to review and possible adjustment by the internal revenue service and may be limited in the event of certain changes in the ownership interest of significant stockholders 
we did not record a tax provision in the fiscal year statement of operations as we did not generate taxable income 
effects of inflation our assets are primarily monetary  consisting of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
since we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources 
recent accounting pronouncements accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the interpretation 
the interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company has not yet completed its evaluation of the interpretation  but does not currently believe that adoption will have a material impact on its results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes a common definition for fair value  creates a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosure requirements about such fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for our first quarter of management does not currently believe that adoption will have a material impact on its results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities in february  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

sfas no 
provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the objective of sfas no 
is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
generally accepted accounting principles have required different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities that can create artificial volatility in earnings 
fasb has indicated it believes that sfas no 
helps to mitigate this type of accounting induced volatility by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value  which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting 
sfas no 
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
for example  sfas no 
requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of the company s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
it also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
sfas no 

table of contents does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards  including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 and fasb statement no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments sfas no 

sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of a company s first fiscal year beginning after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year provided that the company makes that choice in the first days of that fiscal year and also elects to apply the provisions of sfas no 
the company has not yet completed its evaluation of the interpretation  but does not currently believe that adoption will have a material impact on its results of operations  financial position or cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have investments in commercial paper  us government and agency securities as well as corporate bonds and other debt securities 
as a result  we are exposed to potential loss from market risks that may occur as a result of changes in interest rates  changes in credit quality of the issuer or otherwise 
we generally place our marketable security investments in high quality credit instruments  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our investments as of march  however  the conservative nature of our investments mitigates our interest rate exposure  and our investment policy limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue  issuer with the exception of us treasury obligations and type of instrument 
we do not expect any material loss from our marketable security investments due to interest rate fluctuations and therefore believe that our potential interest rate exposure is limited 
we intend to hold these investments to maturity  in accordance with our business plans
