bally gaming and systems gaming equipment we design  manufacture  assemble  sell and operate a full range of technology based gaming devices through our gaming equipment division 
these devices are not mass produced and are normally configured to specific requirements based on a customer s particular order 
gaming devices are differentiated from one another by a number of factors including  but not limited to  graphic design and theme  cabinet style  pay table  game layout  betting denomination and minimum maximum betting amount 
our gaming devices include a variety of game features and layouts in both video and mechanical reel formats 
our gaming devices come in several different cabinet styles with some devices featuring high profile top boxes with various game features and varying sizes geared towards specific market niches 
the gaming products we create are the result of comprehensive product development efforts that include extensive internal and third party testing 
we also perform market tests of our products with the cooperation of casino operators to assess reliability and player appeal 
each gaming device contains an operating system referred to as a game platform 
the operating system manages the software needed to run the device 
game platforms and the related computer systems are updated and revised to keep pace with the ever increasing complexity of modern game play requirements 
the change in game play requirements is driven by  among other things  changes in consumer demand  capacity  security and regulation 
in fiscal  we completed the successful migration from our legacy platforms  including the v and evo  to the linux based alpha os platform 
in fiscal  we also transitioned our mechanical reel spinning devices to the alpha os platform such that the alpha os is now the platform for each of our gaming device product offerings 
as a result  marketing of our legacy products has generally been discontinued 
the alpha os is designed to separate the gaming operating system from the game layer  which enables game development in a much shorter time 
alpha os is also designed to incorporate bonusing  free spin  scatter and other advanced game features  while providing internal and third party developers with a secure  easy to use programming environment that incorporates an advanced set of development tools 
moreover  alpha os is designed to support server based gaming initiatives  including download of game results  configuration and game content 
additionally  our layered architecture and modular design allows for adaptability and simplified requirement changes 
the operating system  which is linux based  is compatible with the most common accounting  ticketing and bonusing systems and supports plus bet lines  various game bonusing  top box support  multi denomination  multi game and multi pay table game configurations 
alpha os also supports stand alone  local and wide area progressive products 
alpha os was originally developed by sierra design group sdg  a company we acquired in the platform is the result of a significant investment in hardware and software engineering and development efforts 
since the acquisition  we have undertaken significant development initiatives to make the alpha os platform compliant with the regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the alpha os platform has now received approval in virtually all major gaming jurisdictions  including nevada  mississippi  new jersey  missouri  florida  pennsylvania  washington  new york and rhode island  as well as various native american jurisdictions 
subsequent to its original regulatory approval  we have developed and launched a series of video and mechanical game themes on alpha os and we will continue to develop new themes to support our cabinet designs and product markets 
we also offer certain game titles in certain jurisdictions that were developed by other gaming manufacturers 
our use of these game titles is governed by license agreements with the other manufacturers 
our sales are not limited to our gaming devices 
customers that purchase or lease our gaming devices typically purchase our replacement parts  upgrades  game conversion kits and other products to keep the devices in good working order and to enhance the underlying performance of the devices 
certain equipment within gaming devices such as video monitors  bill validators  logic boards and printers are typically replaced  whether as a result of part failures or new technology offerings by our suppliers 
these sales may also include game conversion kits that provide our customers the opportunity to offer a new theme or variant on the existing product without the necessity of purchasing an entirely new gaming device 
we generally offer a day parts and labor warranty for new gaming devices 
we provide several after sale services to our customers including customer education programs  a hour customer service telephone hot line  an internet web site for technical support  field service support programs and spare parts programs 
our historical warranty expense as a percentage of revenues has been less than 
from time to time  we also sell used gaming devices  including products made by us as well as those produced by our competitors 
generally  we acquire used devices as trade ins toward the purchase of new gaming devices 
while a small secondary market exists in the united states  used devices are typically resold in international markets where new device purchases often prove to be too costly 
where appropriate  we incur costs to recondition used devices for resale or we may elect to destroy the devices 
we also occasionally sell used equipment in lots on an as is basis to used device brokers and customers 
used game sales totaled million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
bally gaming and systems gaming operations we offer our customers a wide range of lease and rental options through our gaming operations division 
we offer several economic arrangements that generate recurring revenues for us 
specifically  these arrangements are available under four business models linked progressive systems  rental and daily fee games  lottery systems and centrally determined systems 
in most cases  operating gaming devices under a lease or rental arrangement requires us to invest capital in manufacturing the gaming devices and related equipment  purchasing signs and seating and  in certain cases  acquiring certain intellectual property rights 
linked progressive systems we offer our customers gaming devices featuring a common jackpot or prize award that can be linked within a casino or among multiple casinos within a market or jurisdiction 
we first received regulatory approval of our progressive system in nevada in and now operate linked systems in nevada  new jersey  mississippi and certain native american jurisdictions 
progressive gaming devices are typically offered to customers under a daily fee arrangement that is based on a percentage of the money wagered on the participating gaming devices 
in many cases  we use these revenues to fund the ultimate payment of the jackpot awards 
as of june   we had a total of units deployed on our wide area progressive networks 
rental and daily fee games we offer a variety of non linked daily fee games 
we have marketed our daily fee games under such titles as playboy  hot shot progressive  reel winners  hee haw  monte carlo and saturday night live  all of which are approved in most major gaming jurisdictions in which we operate 
in most cases  we incur the cost of manufacturing the gaming devices we rent or lease  and we often provide additional equipment such as signage and chairs for the customers use 
we typically retain ownership of these gaming devices and equipment and depreciate them over their estimated useful lives 
as of june   we had a total installed base of daily fee games of  units 
lottery systems we provide video lottery devices to race tracks for the new york state lottery nysl 
we and sdg prior to our acquisition in march were each awarded approximately of the initial nysl terminals to be installed through a competitive bidding process 
our contract with the nysl runs through december  the financial model for this market requires us to build  deploy and maintain the terminals as well as provide the related equipment in return for a share of the net win generated by the terminals 
the first of these gaming devices was installed in january  and have since been followed by installations of additional devices at several other tracks thereafter 
as of june   our installed base was  units 
we also earn recurring revenues from and video lottery devices deployed at horseracing facilities under agreements with the delaware state lottery and rhode island state lottery commissions  respectively 
in june  we began selling video lottery gaming devices on an original equipment manufacturer  oem  basis to a distributor in iowa 
we received daily fee revenue based on the game s underlying performance as well as for technology services and game themes 
a new law was passed during the iowa state legislative session that banned such devices from operation 
as a result  the games were removed from operation in may ending our daily fee revenue that totaled million during the fiscal year and revenue from the sale of related gaming devices that totaled million during the fiscal year 
centrally determined systems we have a base of centrally determined gaming devices operating primarily in native american casinos in washington  florida  alabama and oklahoma 
with the exception of the gaming devices in oklahoma  these games have generally been sold to the customer and we receive a daily fee for the use of our central determination software 
lease arrangements based on a percentage of the net win are still most prevalent in oklahoma 
as of june   the installed base of centrally determined games totaled  units including gaming devices deployed in mexico described below 
in december  we also began selling centrally determined gaming devices in mexico 
these devices are sold pursuant to a development and supply agreement we entered into with a large distributor in december in the mexican market  we sell gaming devices to our distributor as an oem 
our distributor  in turn  places these devices in locations that house sports betting and pari mutuel betting operations 
in addition to the revenues from the sale of the devices  we derive a daily fee equal to a percentage of the net win for providing a system network  gaming content  and monitoring  maintenance  consulting  marketing and promotion services 
as of june   we had  gaming devices deployed in mexico

rainbow casino operations the rainbow casino  located in vicksburg  mississippi  began operations in july the facility includes a  square foot casino with gaming devices and table games  a seat buffet style restaurant  and a  square foot conference center 
the casino also includes the room rainbow hotel  which is owned and operated by a third party 
rainbow is marketed as a locals casino and draws mid level gaming customers principally from within a mile radius of vicksburg 
our promotions are focused primarily on direct mail and special promotional events 
the vicksburg casino market generated approximately million in gaming revenue in the months ended june   representing a decline in growth of approximately  when compared with the same period last year 
we are the general partners of rainbow casino vicksburg partnership  lp rcvp  the limited partnership that operates rainbow 
the limited partner  rainbow corporation  an unaffiliated third party  is entitled to receive of the net available cash flows after debt service and other items  as defined in the limited partnership agreement  which increases to of the incremental amount of annual revenues in excess of million  payable quarterly through december  we hold the remaining economic interest in the partnership 
the operation of casinos is a highly competitive business 
gaming of all types is available throughout mississippi in numerous locations as well as in surrounding markets 
the principal competitive factors in the industry include the structure  age and location of the facility  the nature  variety and quality of the amenities and customer services offered  and the continuous development  implementation and success of a variety of marketing programs 
our rainbow casino faces intense direct competition from other gaming facilities servicing the vicksburg market  and  to a lesser degree  indirect competition from those servicing the gulf coast region 
a new casino project adjacent to the rainbow casino is under construction and is scheduled to open in july there may be other new casinos constructed in the vicksburg market in the future as previously existing and new gulf coast properties continue to open in the aftermath of the hurricane season 
these properties will provide additional competition to our business 
product development we believe providing games and systems with high entertainment value and key operational advantages coupled with a high level of customer service is important to gaining market share 
we believe that the use of technology within casinos has accelerated over the past five years and gives newer gaming devices and systems competitive advantages over their more antiquated counterparts 
our total spending on research and development was million  million and million during the years ended june   and  respectively 
the increase in research and development spending over this three year period reflects our corporate focus towards our technology assets  the expansion of technical resources through our acquisitions  and the competitive landscape that requires continuous development of future generations of gaming products and systems 
we develop our products for both the domestic and international markets 
our product development process for our gaming devices includes both hardware and software 
major areas of hardware development include cabinet style  technical capability  interfaces  peripheral devices  and coin and currency handling 
hardware development efforts are focused on player appeal  product reliability and ease of maintenance 
development cycles for hardware can range from a few days for simple enhancements to more than a year for new electronics or new mechanical packages 
the software development process for new games  which includes graphics development  is continuous and requires significant human resources 
creativity in software development is an important element in the market success and player appeal of our gaming devices 
innovations in our development process and game design are generated internally  by customers and by third parties  many of whom have entered into strategic relationships with us 
following the completion of development of our products and internal quality testing  our products are subjected to a rigorous and time consuming process of independent and jurisdictional testing by regulatory agencies and their agents 
all new or modified hardware and software is designed to satisfy all applicable testing standards 
typically  new products require various approvals from numerous regulatory agencies 
many jurisdictions outside north america require a lower level of testing and  in certain cases  do not require any such approvals 
each jurisdiction that requires regulatory approval of new products has its own filing requirement and process 
in certain cases  we may receive approvals if our products are approved in other major gaming jurisdictions 
once products are approved by the gaming regulators  customers may also require field trials of our products in their casinos to ensure compatibility and stability while reserving the right to return the product at any time during the field trial period 
we do not recognize revenue until the customer ends the field trial and accepts the gaming devices 
the regulatory and licensing processes that we are subject to are discussed more fully below  under gaming regulations and licensing 
product development for casino enterprise systems also includes hardware and software 
the major areas of hardware development include controller circuit board design and programming  as well as user interface devices such as card readers  keypads and displays 
software development includes extensive application development  including elements such as databases  interfaces used in products such as iview  communication  security and automated backup and failure procedures 
we have developed a modular and extendible hardware and software architecture  which focuses development on achieving greater functionality  product reliability  ease of maintenance for the casino operator  and ease of use for the player 
in addition  the architecture allows customers to upgrade existing components or add new components with less impact as compared to a complete replacement 
development cycles for hardware can vary between a few months for minor revisions to more than a year for major design changes 
software development results in periodic product releases that include new features that extend or enhance the casino enterprise systems 
less significant revisions such as periodic maintenance releases are also deployed to enable casino operators to correct problems or improve the usability of the system 
we have developed a series of cashless and bonusing products marketed under the bally power bonusing name 
the bally power bonusing products represent an integrated set of cashless and bonusing features to enhance the gaming experience of casino patrons 
these products allow the transfer of funds using bar coded coupons and or encrypted pin numbers to download either restricted or unrestricted credits to the gaming device 
these products allow casino operators to reduce cash and coin handling expenses  minimize overall operating expenditures and provide creative marketing incentives to their casino patrons 
our cashless products are in use in most gaming markets  including nevada  michigan  new jersey  mississippi  louisiana  iowa  colorado  missouri  indiana and various native american and international jurisdictions 
the software development process for our systems includes the design and development of features to meet various regulatory standards 
the regulatory standards vary by jurisdiction  which forces us to develop multiple software settings based on the individual state and tribal gaming standards 
each jurisdiction can also require the approval of any software modifications or new products prior to their deployment at casino locations within the jurisdiction 
the approval processes can vary significantly by jurisdiction  based on the software changes developed  technology enhancements  and regulator resources 
product markets we believe that the total installed base of gaming devices in north america  including the united states and canada  now exceeds  units 
this total includes land based  riverboat  native american casino and video lottery markets 
new sales opportunities for gaming devices in north america are primarily driven by replacement of existing units  new casino openings or expansions and legalization in new markets 
the gaming industry also continues to expand in international markets 
europe  the caribbean  south america and the pacific rim are currently our primary international markets 
we regularly evaluate expanding our business into additional international markets 
we distribute our gaming devices through direct sales efforts and through a small number of distribution arrangements 
our international business is conducted primarily from offices in manchester  england and hanover  germany for customers in europe  puerto rico for customers in the caribbean  buenos aires  argentina for customers in south america  and macau  china for customers in the pacific rim 
the primary markets for casino enterprise systems are the united states and  to a lesser extent  canada  south america  europe  the pacific rim and the caribbean though additional international markets are beginning to emerge 
markets for systems within the united states include traditional land based casinos in markets such as nevada and new jersey  native american casinos and riverboat casinos 
the market for our casino enterprise systems includes new casino openings  expansion and upgrades of existing facilities and the competitive replacement of other systems 
we also generate new system sales through the introduction of new hardware and software products 
in many cases  domestic regulations require the implementation of systems as part of their operational requirements while international markets have only recently begun the full implementation of such systems 
we believe  as international markets begin to mature and become more competitive  the use of systems will become more common 
sales and marketing we have a direct domestic sales force consisting of approximately employees located in multiple offices throughout north america 
we also  to a lesser extent  utilize an independent distributor network to distribute our products 
the agreements we have with distributors generally specify minimum purchases and also provide that we may terminate the relationship if certain performance standards are not met 
our direct sales force generated approximately  and of new gaming device sales for the years ended june   and  respectively 
distributors generated approximately  and of new gaming device sales for the years ended june   and  respectively 
substantially all of system revenues are generated by our direct sales force 
the sale of gaming devices takes place throughout our fiscal year and can range from proposals for a small quantity of units to several thousand units 
we conduct one on one meetings with our customers to demonstrate our products at their locations  host customers to private demonstrations in our offices or at offsite venues  and participate in several trade shows domestically and internationally each year 
in certain cases  we participate in responding to competitive requests for proposals from private and public entities seeking to purchase gaming equipment 
for casino enterprise system sales  we offer our customers the option of signing separate hardware and software maintenance agreements at the time of sale 
these agreements are typically for one year terms and automatically renew unless otherwise canceled in writing by either party 
after an initial warranty period  typically days  the customer is invoiced monthly for hardware and software maintenance fees that provide for  among other things  repair or replacement of malfunctioning hardware and software  software version upgrades  and on call support for software 
the sale of enterprise systems is often a long process  at times extending beyond one year 
typically  a potential systems customer will participate in a formal evaluation and selection of a system vendor 
the level of sales available to us at any point in time can vary materially due to a number of factors  including the capital budgets of our customers  availability of new product modules  timing associated with regulatory approvals  and the success and features contained in the products sold by our competitors 
the price paid for a full system can vary materially from customer to customer depending on a number of factors  including but not limited to  the size of the gaming operation  the number of functions contained in the system specified  and the level of post sale support provided 
we generally sell gaming devices and our computerized monitoring systems through normal credit terms of days or less 
in certain circumstances  we may grant credit terms that may extend up to five years 
international sales are either consummated on a cash basis or financed over no more than two years  depending on credit quality 
customers the demand for gaming devices and systems varies depending on the level of new construction and renovation of casinos as well as market conditions that might generate the need for new and replacement equipment and product innovation 
gaming devices generally have an average replacement cycle of three to seven years 
for the year ended june   our largest customers  including corporate customers with multiple casino properties  accounted for approximately of sales 
in addition to direct commercial transactions with casino customers  we may sell gaming devices on an oem basis to other parties who  in turn  sell these products to end user casino customers 
in certain cases  these parties may be competing with us in markets where we also sell our products 
in several cases  our oems also purchase certain bally proprietary game themes  which are redesigned to be compatible with their operating system configurations 
sales of oem units totaled approximately million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively  and sales of licenses to oems for the use of bally game themes totaled approximately million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the demand for casino enterprise systems is driven by regulatory requirements in each applicable jurisdiction by casino operators competitive need to properly track device and player activity and  to establish and compile individual device and player profitability and other demographic information 
these features enable casinos to develop or enhance marketing strategies 
revenues for casino enterprise systems are derived from selling products to new or existing customers 
for the year ended june   the ten largest casino enterprise system customers  which include certain multi site casino operators that have corporate agreements  accounted for approximately of game monitoring unit sales revenues  with the largest single customer accounting for of these revenues 
future sales of our technology products will be based on  among other elements  continued expansion of our product line  the success of our game content  the acceptance of our systems  our customer service levels  expansion into additional domestic and international markets  and our ability to maintain a competitive position against other technology providers who are producing similar products 
manufacturing and assembly operations we own our primary offices in las vegas  which were completed in the  square foot facility was constructed specifically for the design  assembly and distribution of gaming equipment and to meet product design demands and varying levels of volume requirements 
in fiscal  we completed a substantial change to our product line which has benefited our assembly operations 
historically  we managed a series of game device platforms and product families which required certain dedicated resources and capacity in our assembly operations 
our consolidation to the alpha os platform and engineering efforts towards common hardware components has provided greater flexibility in our assembly operations where each product family can now be produced by an expanded set of assembly lines with fewer internal product differences and more streamlined testing 
we believe our primary offices and related facilities in las vegas  as well as the process improvement initiatives noted above  will enable us to increase production without adding significant floor space 
we generally buy raw material inventory to build our gaming devices when we receive firm orders from our customers 
to the extent possible  we also forecast the demand for our products to develop more efficient supply chains with our vendors 
we create specifications and design nearly all of the major assemblies that are incorporated into our gaming devices 
competition we compete with a number of domestic and international businesses in the various geographic markets where we sell our products 
our ability to compete effectively is based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  our product quality  product depth  pricing  financing terms  regulatory approvals  the successful development and protection of intellectual property as well as the success of our distribution  sales and service levels 
the north american gaming device market is dominated by international game technology igt 
igt has substantially greater financial resources and more products and intellectual property than its competitors 
many of our customers derive a significant portion of their gaming revenues using igt products 
some of our other competitors currently include aristocrat leisure limited aristocrat  atronic international  gtech holdings corporation gtech  konami co 
ltd 
konami and wms industries  inc wms 
these competitors also compete in the international markets we serve  along with well established foreign companies such as ainsworth game technology ltd  aruze gaming america  inc  unidesa gaming and systems  novomatic ag  and recreativos franco sa 
the competition for casino enterprise systems is also significant 
product feature and functionality  accuracy  reliability  service level and pricing are all among the key factors in determining a provider s success in selling its system 
our principal competition in casino management systems currently consists of  among others  igt  aristocrat  konami and several smaller competitive providers in the international market 
competition is keen in this market due to the number of providers and the limited number of casinos and jurisdictions in which they operate 
management believes the future success of our operations will be determined by our ability to bring new and innovative products to the market while maintaining our base of loyal existing customers 
patents  copyrights and trade secrets we have been a long standing participant in the development of intellectual property in our industry 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trade secrets  trademarks and proprietary information to maintain and enhance our competitive position 
we have been granted patents and have patent applications pending in the united states as well as in many foreign countries 
the expiration dates of these patents vary and are based on their filing and issuances dates 
we intend to continue to actively file for patent protection  where reasonable  within and outside the united states 
we also seek protection for a large number of our products by filing for copyrights and trademarks in the united states and various foreign countries 
under permission or license agreements with third parties  we also sell products covered by independently filed copyrights and trademarks 
typically  these contracts require us to pay royalties to the licensing party 
royalty expense is included in cost of gaming and systems in our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
employees and labor relations as of june   we and our subsidiaries employed approximately  individuals worldwide  including approximately employees at rainbow 
none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
we believe we have satisfactory relationships with our employees

we are required to comply with all such sources of law  which may impose different requirements with respect to licensing  product approvals  and operations 
additional jurisdictions 
in the ordinary course of our business  we routinely consider opportunities to expand our gaming operations into additional jurisdictions 
virtually all of those jurisdictions require licenses  permits  documentation of qualification  including evidence of financial stability  and other forms of approval for companies engaged in the manufacture  distribution and operation of gaming devices as well as for the officers  directors  major stockholders  and key personnel of such companies

risk factors investing in our common stock involves risks 
prospective investors in our common stock should carefully consider  among other things  the following factors and other information contained in this document  including our financial statements and the notes to those statements  prior to making an investment decision 
we have identified the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements we may make from time to time 
our success in the gaming industry depends in large part on our ability to develop innovative products and systems 
if we fail to keep pace with rapid innovations in product design and deployment  or if we are unable to quickly adapt our development and manufacturing processes to release innovative products or systems  our business could be negatively impacted 
our success is heavily dependent on our ability to develop new products and systems that are attractive not only to our customers  namely casino operators and other gaming enterprises  but also to their customers  the end players 
therefore  our future success depends upon our ability to continue to design and market technologically sophisticated products that meet our customers needs regarding  among other things  ease of use and adaptability  but also that are unique and entertaining such that they achieve high levels of player appeal and sustainability as well 
if our competitors continue to develop new game themes and technologically innovative products and systems and we fail to keep pace  our business could be adversely affected 
the demands of our customers and the tastes of their customers are continuously changing 
as a result  there is constant pressure to develop and market new game themes and technologically innovative products 
as our revenues are heavily dependent on the earning power and life span of our games and because newer game themes tend to have a shorter life span than more traditional game themes  we face increased pressure to design and deploy new and successful game themes to maintain our revenue stream and remain competitive 
while we feel we have been successful at developing new and innovative products  our ability to do so could be adversely affected by a decline in the popularity of our gaming products with players  a decision by our customers or the gaming industry in general to cut back on purchases of new games or systems in anticipation of newer technologies  an inability to roll out new games  services or systems on schedule as a result of delays in connection with regulatory product approval in the applicable jurisdictions  or otherwise  an increase in the popularity of competitors games  and a decline in consumer acceptance of our newest systems innovations 
our success also depends upon our ability to adapt our manufacturing capabilities and processes to meet the demands of producing new and innovative products 
because our newer products are generally more technologically sophisticated than those we have produced in the past  we must continually refine our production capabilities to meet the needs of our continuing product innovation 
in addition  the shorter lifespan of newer products means we must update our production capabilities more frequently and rapidly than in the past 
if we cannot adapt our manufacturing infrastructure to meet the needs of our product innovations  or if we are unable to make upgrades to our production capacity in a timely manner  our business could be negatively impacted 
the gaming industry is intensely competitive 
we face competition from a number of companies  some of which have greater resources  and if we are unable to compete effectively  our business could be negatively impacted 
bally gaming and systems competition among gaming machine manufacturers is based on  among other things  competitive pricing and financing terms made available to customers  appeal of game themes and features to the end player and product quality  features and functionality of hardware and software 
there are a number of established  well financed companies producing machines that compete with each bally gaming and systems product line in each of their respective markets 
while there are several competitors in the field  a single competitor  igt  dominates the domestic market for gaming machines 
certain of these competitors have access to greater capital resources than we do  and as a result  may be better positioned to compete in the marketplace 
the casino enterprise systems market is crowded  with igt and aristocrat comprising the primary competition 
the competition is intense due to the number of providers  as well as the limited number of casino operators and jurisdictions in which they operate 
as there has been a recent trend of consolidation among the casino operators  the level of competition among providers has increased significantly as the number of potential customers has decreased 
pricing  product feature and function  accuracy and reliability are among the factors in determining a provider s success in selling its system 
casino operations among the principal competitive factors in the casino industry are the stature  age and location of the facility  the nature  variety and quality of the amenities and customer services offered  and the continuous development  implementation and success of a variety of marketing programs 
our rainbow casino in vicksburg  mississippi faces intense direct competition from other gaming facilities serving the vicksburg market and  to a lesser degree  indirect competition from those serving the gulf coast region 
a new casino project adjacent to the rainbow casino is under construction and is scheduled to open in july there may be other new casinos constructed in the vicksburg market in the future as previously existing and new gulf coast properties continue to open in the aftermath of the hurricane season 
as certain of these competitors have only recently opened  customers may be drawn to these properties and their newer facilities and amenities 
moreover  additional potential gaming sites remain in and around vicksburg 
as the overall size of the potential customer base for the vicksburg market is limited  we also face competition from casinos in nearby locations 
these properties may further dilute the market from which we and the other vicksburg casinos draw most of our patrons 
some of these sites may also be closer to larger population centers and  if developed  may enjoy a competitive advantage over our casino 
to the extent there is a change in ownership of any of our customers or further consolidation within the casino industry  our business could be negatively impacted 
we are heavily dependent on the casino industry 
demand for our products is primarily driven by the replacement of existing products as well as the expansion of existing casinos and the opening of new properties and new jurisdictions 
events within the industry leading or contributing to a decline in demand for our product  such as mergers or consolidations  could adversely affect our business 
casino operators in the gaming industry are currently undergoing a period of consolidation 
the result of this trend is that a smaller number of companies control a larger percentage of our current and potential customer base 
because a significant portion of our sales come from repeat customers  to the extent one of our customers is sold to or merges with an entity that utilizes the products and services of one of our competitors or that reduces spending on our products  or causes downward pricing pressures  our business could be negatively impacted 
business combinations of this nature could lead to a cancellation of orders  slow the replacement cycle or negatively impact pricing and purchasing decisions 
we may not be able to attract or retain the management or employees necessary to remain competitive in our industry 
the competition for qualified personnel in the gaming industry is intense 
our future success depends on the retention and continued contributions of our key management  finance  marketing  and staff personnel  many of whom would be difficult or impossible to replace 
our success is also tied to our ability to recruit additional key personnel in the future 
we may not be able to retain our current personnel or recruit any additional key personnel required 
the loss of services of any of our personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
the gaming industry is heavily regulated and changes in regulation by gaming authorities may adversely impact our ability to operate in our existing markets or expand our business 
the manufacture and distribution of gaming machines  development of systems and the conduct of gaming operations are subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign regulation by various gaming authorities 
our ability to continue to operate in certain jurisdictions or our ability to expand into new jurisdictions could be adversely affected by delays in adopting legislation to permit or expand gaming in new and existing jurisdictions  unfavorable public referendums  such as referendums to increase taxes on gaming revenues  unfavorable legislation affecting or directed at manufacturers or gaming operators  adverse changes in or findings of non compliance with applicable governmental gaming regulations  delays in approvals from regulatory agencies  a limitation  conditioning  suspension or revocation of any of our gaming licenses  unfavorable determinations or challenges of suitability by gaming regulatory authorities with respect to our officers  directors  major stockholders or key personnel  and the adoption of new laws and regulations  or the repeal or amendment of existing laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  internet gaming 
public opinion can also exert a significant influence over the regulation of the gaming industry 
a negative shift in the public s perception of gaming  whether in individual jurisdictions or on a more general level  could affect future legislation 
among other things  such a shift could cause jurisdictions considering the legalization of gaming to abandon such a proposal  thereby limiting the number of new jurisdictions into which we could expand 
negative public perception could also lead to the implementation of new restrictions in jurisdictions in which we currently operate  thereby adversely affecting our operations 
although the laws  rules and regulations of the various jurisdictions in which we operate vary in their technical requirements  virtually all jurisdictions  including those into which we may expand in the future  require licenses  permits  qualification documentation  including evidence of integrity and financial stability  and other forms of approval to engage in gaming operations or the manufacture and distribution of gaming machines 
our officers  directors  major stockholders and key personnel are also subject to significant regulatory scrutiny 
in the event that gaming or governmental authorities determine that any person is unsuitable to act in such capacity with respect to the company  we could be required to terminate our relationship with such person 
to our knowledge  the company and our key personnel have obtained  or applied for  all government licenses  registrations  findings of suitability  permits and approvals necessary to conduct their respective activities in the various jurisdictions that we operate 
however  there can be no assurance those licenses  registrations  findings of suitability  permits or approvals will be renewed in the future  or that new forms of approval necessary to operate in emerging or existing markets will be granted 
in some jurisdictions  audited financial statements must be filed with the gaming regulatory authorities 
the late filing of our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june  could generate inquiries from regulators  including possible disciplinary action 
our intellectual property protections may be insufficient to properly safeguard our technology 
the gaming industry is constantly employing new technologies in both new and existing markets 
we rely on a combination of patent and other technical security measures to protect our products  and continue to apply for patents protecting such technologies 
notwithstanding these safeguards  our competitors may still be able to obtain our technology or imitate our products 
furthermore  others may independently develop products similar or superior to ours 
we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement or invalidity 
expenses incurred with respect to monitoring  protecting and defending our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 
competitors and other third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights  or may allege that we have infringed on their rights 
monitoring infringement and misappropriation of intellectual property can be difficult and expensive  and we may not be able to detect infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights 
we may also incur significant litigation expenses protecting our intellectual property or defending our use of intellectual property  reducing our ability to fund product initiatives 
these expenses could have an adverse effect on our future cash flows and results of operations 
we are currently subject to litigation regarding patent infringement which  if resolved adversely to the company  could have a material impact on our business 
if we are found to infringe on the rights of others we could be required to discontinue offering certain products or systems  to pay damages or purchase a license to use the intellectual property in question from its owner 
litigation can also divert management from the day to day operations of the business 
there can be no assurances that certain of our products  including those with currently pending patent applications  will not be determined to have infringed upon an existing third party patent 
the intellectual property rights of others may prevent us from developing new products or entering new markets 
the gaming industry is characterized by the rapid development of new technologies  which requires us to continuously introduce new products using these technologies and innovations  as well as to expand into new markets that may be created 
therefore  our success depends in part on our ability to continually adapt our products and systems to incorporate new technologies and to expand into markets that may be created by new technologies 
however  to the extent technologies are protected by the intellectual property rights of others  including our competitors  we may be prevented from introducing products based on these technologies or expanding into markets created by these technologies 
if the intellectual property rights of others prevent us from taking advantage of innovative technologies  our financial condition  operating results or prospects may be harmed 
our gaming operations  particularly our wide area progressive networks and centrally determined systems  may experience losses due to technical difficulties or fraudulent activities 
our success depends on our ability to avoid  detect  replicate and correct software and hardware errors and fraudulent manipulation of our products and systems 
to the extent any of our gaming machines or software experience errors or fraudulent manipulation  our customers may replace our products and services with those of our competitors 
in addition  the occurrence of errors in  or fraudulent manipulation of  our gaming machines or software may give rise to claims for lost revenues and related litigation by our customers and may subject us to investigation or other action by gaming regulatory authorities  including suspension or revocation of our gaming licenses or disciplinary action 
additionally  in the event of such issues with our gaming machines or software  substantial engineering and marketing resources may be diverted from other areas to rectify the problem 
our inability to produce and report current financial information in a timely manner could adversely affect our business financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
our delay in producing current financial information could limit our access to current financial information regarding our business  results of operations or financial condition  which means that we may not become immediately aware of short term trends or recent developments in our business 
this delay could also cause us to miss opportunities to adjust to such trends or developments that would otherwise have been available to us had we had timely access to the financial information 
this delay could also prevent us from discovering a default under the financial covenants set forth in our bank loan agreement until well after the default has occurred  thereby eliminating any opportunity we may have had to cure the default 
we have material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting  which could adversely affect our ability to manage and to report our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows accurately 
as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  management has conducted an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting 
material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could  among other things  adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information 
in performing our assessment  management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of june  for a detailed description of these material weaknesses  see item a  controls and procedures 
we have taken and will continue to take certain measures to strengthen our internal controls  as set forth under item a  controls and procedures 
however  additional work still remains to address the identified material weaknesses 
if we are unsuccessful in implementing or following our remediation plan  or fail to update our internal controls as our business evolves  we may not be able to  among other things  accurately report our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows or maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures 
any such failure could lead to  among other things  an additional sec enforcement action  additional securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence  any one of which could adversely affect our business and prospects 
we face increased costs and have extensive work remaining to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting 
we have extensive work remaining to remediate the identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
as discussed in item a  controls and procedures  this work has extended into the fiscal year and will continue until we are able to remediate the material weaknesses we have identified 
these matters have required  and will continue to require  a significant amount of management time and a significant commitment of external resources 
the costs of these efforts are substantial and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial performance 
the restatements of our consolidated financial statements may subject us to actions or additional litigation which could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
in this annual report on form k we have restated our consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the years in the period ending june  and in october of  we also restated our consolidated financial statements as of june  and  and for each of the three years in the period ending june  these restatements may result in additional scrutiny in our ongoing sec investigation or to new regulatory actions or civil litigation which could require us to pay fines or other penalties or damages and could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
the restatements may also result in negative publicity and we may lose or fail to attract and retain key customers  employees and management personnel as a result of these matters 
the ongoing sec investigation could adversely affect us 
the sec is conducting a formal inquiry into certain matters surrounding the allegations relating to the securities class action litigation and our methods of revenue recognition 
in accordance with its normal practice  the sec has not advised us when its investigation may be concluded  and we are unable to predict the outcome of this investigation 
while we are cooperating fully with the investigation  adverse developments in connection with the investigation  including any expansion of the scope of the investigation  could negatively impact us and could divert the efforts and attention of our management team from our ordinary business operations 
in connection with any sec investigation  it is possible that we will be required to  among other things  pay fines  consent to injunctions on future conduct  further restate our financial statements or suffer other penalties  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
certain consequences of our reporting situation under the federal securities laws limits our ability to raise capital 
our past delays in meeting the reporting requirements of the federal securities laws affects our ability to access the capital markets 
now that we have filed all of our delinquent periodic reports  we may make registered offerings of securities  however  until we have filed all of our periodic reports in a timely manner for a period of twelve months  we will be ineligible to use shelf registration or short form registration  which allows us to incorporate our periodic reports by reference into our registration statements 
consumer spending on leisure activities is affected by changes in the economy and consumer tastes  as well as other factors that are difficult to predict and beyond our control 
we cannot ensure that demand for our products or services will remain constant 
consumers willingness to spend money on leisure activities such as gaming is affected by changes in the economy and consumer tastes  both of which are both difficult to predict and beyond our control 
continued adverse developments affecting economies throughout the world  including a general tightening of the availability of credit  increasing interest rates  increasing energy costs  acts of war or terrorism  natural disasters  declining consumer confidence or significant declines in the stock market could lead to a further reduction in discretionary spending on leisure activities adversely affecting our business 
unfavorable political developments  weak foreign economies and other foreign risks may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
our business is dependent on international markets for a portion of our revenues 
as of june   bally gaming and systems had million of receivables  or of our total receivables  from customers in foreign countries 
we expect that receivables with respect to foreign sales will continue to account for a portion of our total revenues 
as a result  our business in these markets is subject to a variety of risks  including recessions in foreign economies  expropriation  nationalization and limitation on repatriation of earnings  currency exchange fluctuations  reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  longer receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  difficulties in managing foreign operations  social  political and economic instability  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  ability to finance foreign operations  changes in consumer tastes and trends  tariffs and other trade barriers  acts of war or terrorism  and us government requirements for export 
there can be no assurances that any of these international developments  or others  would not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our bank loan agreement imposes significant restrictions and failure to comply with these restrictions could result in the acceleration of a substantial portion of our debt  which we may not be able to repay or refinance 
when our bank loan agreement comes due  we may not be able to obtain new financing on equal or better terms 
our bank loan agreement contains a number of covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability and certain of our subsidiaries to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock  pay dividends or make other distributions  enter into certain acquisitions  repurchase equity interests or subordinated indebtedness  issue or sell equity interests of our subsidiaries  and engage in mergers or consolidations or certain other transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates 
in addition  the bank loan agreement requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios  including certain leverage ratios 
our ability to comply with such ratios  meet our debt service obligations or reduce our total debt is dependent upon our future performance  which may be affected by events beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with such restrictions and limitations  or that they will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs  or engage in other business activities that would otherwise be in the company s interest 
a breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under the bank loan agreement 
in the event of any such default  the lenders could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding under the bank loan agreement  together with any accrued interest and other fees  to be due and payable  as well as require us to apply all available cash to repay the amounts 
if we were unable to repay the indebtedness upon its acceleration  the lenders could proceed against the underlying collateral 
there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay the amount in full  or that we would be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the indebtedness 
the revolving credit facility under our bank loan agreement must be repaid in september  and the term loan facility under our bank loan agreement must be repaid in september while we do not anticipate difficulties in obtaining new financing in the future  there can be no assurances that we will obtain such financing  or that it will be on equal or better terms than those of our current bank loan agreement 
any new financing may be subject to higher interest rates  may include less favorable financial ratios or may require us to agree to additional or more severe restrictions on our business activities as compared to those of our current bank loan agreement 
virtually all of our debt is subject to variable interest rates  rising interest rates could negatively impact our business 
borrowings under our bank loan agreement bear interest at a variable rate 
in addition  we may incur other variable rate indebtedness in the future 
carrying indebtedness subject to variable interest rates makes the company more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns and reduces our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions 
increases in interest rates on this indebtedness would increase our interest expense  which could adversely affect our cash flows and our ability to service our debt as well as our ability to grow the business 
current borrowings  as well as potential future financings  may substantially increase our current indebtedness 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to generate the cash flows necessary to permit us to meet our fixed charges and payment obligations with respect to our debt 
we could be required to incur additional indebtedness to meet these fixed charges and payment obligations 
should we incur additional debt  among other things  such increased indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to expand the business  market our products and make investments and capital expenditures  adversely affect the cost and availability of funds from commercial lenders  debt financing transactions and other sources  and create competitive disadvantages compared to other companies with lower debt levels 
any inability to service our fixed charges and payment obligations  or the incurrence of additional debt  would have an adverse effect on our cash flows  results of operations and business generally 
an inability to maintain sufficient liquidity could negatively affect expected levels of operations and new product development 
future revenue may not be sufficient to meet operating  product development and other cash flow requirements 
sufficient funds to service our debt and maintain new product development efforts and expected levels of operations may not be available  and additional capital  if and when needed by us  may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot obtain sufficient capital on acceptable terms when needed  we may not be able to carry out our planned product development efforts and level of operations  which could harm our business 
our financial results vary from quarter to quarter  which could negatively impact our business 
various factors affect our quarterly operating results  some of which are not within our control 
these factors include  among others the financial strength of the gaming industry  consumer s willingness to spend money on leisure activities  the timing and introduction of new products and services  the mix of products and services sold  the timing of significant orders from and shipments to customers  product and service pricing and discounts  the timing of acquisitions of other companies and businesses or dispositions  and general economic conditions 
these and other factors are likely to cause our financial results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
based on the foregoing  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful 
in addition  such fluctuations could cause us to be unable to comply with the financial ratios in our bank loan agreement 
certain market risks may affect our business  results of operations and prospects 
in the normal course of our business  we are routinely subjected to a variety of market risks  examples of which include  but are not limited to  interest rate movements  collectibility of receivables and recoverability of residual values on leased assets 
further  some of our payors may experience financial difficulties  or may otherwise not pay accounts receivable when due  resulting in increased write offs 
although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas  no assurances can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future 
we have adopted a shareholder rights plan  which  together with provisions in our restated articles of incorporation and nevada law  could discourage or prevent a potential takeover of our company that might otherwise result in you receiving a premium over the market price for your common stock 
we adopted a shareholder rights plan pursuant to which we distributed one right for each outstanding share of common stock held by stockholders of record as of march  because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting a take over of us without the approval of our board of directors  even if such a change in control would result in our stockholders receiving a premium for their shares  the plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock  without first negotiating with our board of directors 
additionally  our restated articles of incorporation permit our board of directors to issue special shares from time to time  with such rights and preferences as they consider appropriate 
our board of directors could authorize the issuance of special shares with terms and conditions and under circumstances that could have an effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction 
as a nevada corporation  we are also subject to certain provisions of the nevada general corporation law that have anti takeover effects and may inhibit a non negotiated merger or other business combination 
these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with  and to obtain the approval of  our board of directors in connection with such a transaction 
however  certain of these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of the company  including an acquisition in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
as a result  stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have the opportunity to do so

the company and the other defendants moved to dismiss the complaint 
thereafter  activity in the case was stopped and the parties participated in a mediation process during which the parties agreed on the terms of a settlement 
the parties negotiated and executed settlement documents settling both the consolidated class action and the derivative case discussed below 
under the settlement  an aggregate of million in cash  plus certain interest  was paid to settle the securities class action as well as the derivative litigation as discussed below 
the company accrued million related to the settlement during the year ended june   which was paid in late february in addition to certain governance actions the company agreed to undertake in connection with the settlement  the company s directors and officers insurer contributed approximately million to the settlement 
the court approved the settlement on august   ending the case 
in july  two derivative lawsuits were filed in nevada state court against the members of the board of directors and the officers listed above 
the company was named as a nominal defendant in the derivative lawsuits as the claims were purportedly asserted for the benefit of bally technologies  inc these lawsuits asserted claims for breach of fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets arising out of the same events as those giving rise to the class actions described above  and sought injunctive relief and damages in unspecified amounts 
these two cases were consolidated  and the company and the other defendants moved to dismiss the case 
in february  the state district court granted the defendants motion and dismissed the case 
the plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the nevada supreme court  which referred the matter to its settlement conference program 
the parties met with a court appointed settlement judge on december   and agreed to settle the case for  and on february   the nevada supreme court entered its order dismissing the appeal and ending the case 
on march   shortly after the aforementioned derivative suit was dismissed in the nevada state court  another derivative lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the district of nevada against individual defendants robert miodunski  robert saxton  steven des champs  mark lerner  david robbins  anthony dicesare  joel kirschbaum  kevin verner  richard haddrill  stephen race  jacques andr and nominal defendant bally technologies  inc based on factual allegations that are similar to those alleged in the federal securities class action complaints and the previous derivative actions that were dismissed by the district court  the derivative complaint alleged breach of fiduciary duty  abuse of control  gross mismanagement  waste of corporate assets  unjust enrichment and violation of the sarbanes oxley act of the parties reached a settlement agreement as discussed more fully above

management is cooperating fully with the sec in this matter 
in august  shuffle master sued the company in the united states district court for the district of nevada  alleging infringement of various patents in connection with the company s mindplay product line and seeking injunctive relief and damages in an unspecified amount 
in june  it was announced that igt had acquired an interest in the patents at issue in the case  and thereafter igt joined the case as a plaintiff 
in december  the district court issued a ruling construing the claim terms of all the patents in the suit 
a hearing on the parties dispositive motions is set for december management believes the plaintiffs lawsuit to be without merit  and the company is vigorously defending against the lawsuit 
in september  a united states district court jury in the district of nevada entered a million verdict against the company in a suit filed by action gaming agi and igt 
the suit alleged that the multi hand video poker game deployed by the company s former subsidiary  united coin machine co 
united coin  infringed the plaintiffs patents 
the federal district court ruled on summary judgment that the game did not infringe the patents 
however  the court left to the jury the question whether the use of autohold  a specific  optional feature of the game  caused it to infringe under the doctrine of equivalents  a doctrine of patent law 
the jury determined that the game with the autohold option enabled did infringe under the doctrine of equivalents and awarded damages accordingly 
the feature has been disabled on all affected games in the field  and the decision permits continued deployment of the game as long as the autohold feature is not included 
the company appealed the decision to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit and posted a cash bond totaling million to stay payment of the judgment and accrued interest pending the appeal 
on july   the federal circuit court of appeals affirmed the district court judgment  denying the appeals for both parties  and thereafter  the judgment was satisfied out of the posted bond
