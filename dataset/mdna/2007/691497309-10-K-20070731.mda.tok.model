our significant trademarks are discussed within each operating group discussion above 
important factors relating to risks associated with our trademarks include  but are not limited to  those described in part i  item a 
risk factors 
competition we sell our products in highly competitive domestic and international markets in which numerous united states based and foreign apparel firms compete 
no single apparel firm or small group of apparel firms dominates the apparel industry 
we believe that competition within the branded apparel industry is based primarily upon design  brand image  consumer preference  price  quality  marketing and customer service 
we believe our ability to compete successfully in styling and marketing is related to our ability to foresee changes and trends in fashion and consumer preference  and to present appealing branded and private label products for consumers 
particularly with respect to our private label businesses  in some instances a retailer that is our customer may compete directly with us by sourcing its products directly or by marketing its own private label brands 
important factors relating to risks associated with competition include  but are not limited to  those described in part i  item a 
risk factors 
seasonal aspects of business and order backlog seasonal aspects of business although our various product lines are sold on a year round basis  the demand for specific products or styles may be seasonal 
for example  the demand for golf and tommy bahama products is higher in the spring and summer seasons 
generally our products are sold prior to each of the retail selling seasons  including spring  summer  fall and holiday 
as the timing of product shipments and other events affecting the retail business may vary  results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year 
the percentage of net sales by quarter for fiscal was   and  respectively  and the percentage of operating income by quarter for fiscal was   and  respectively  which may not be indicative of the distribution in future years 

table of contents order backlog as of june  and june   we had booked orders totaling million and million  respectively  substantially all of which we expect will be or were shipped within six months after each such date 
once we receive a specific purchase order  the dollar value of such order is included in our booked orders 
a portion of our business consists of at once edi quick response programs with large retailers 
replenishment shipments under these programs generally have such an abbreviated order life as to exclude them from the order backlog completely 
we do not believe that this backlog information is necessarily indicative of sales to be expected for future periods 
trade regulation international trade agreements  trade preference arrangements and trade legislation are important to our business because most apparel imports into the united states are highly restricted 
there are two key types of restrictions 
first  there are duties levied on the value of imported apparel 
the duty rates on the cotton and wool product categories that cover the majority of our products range from to 
silk products represent a major portion of our tommy bahama products and are generally subject to duty rates of less than 
second  until january   the united states had implemented restrictive quotas on the importation of many classifications of textiles and apparel products from most of the major apparel producing countries  including most of the countries where we produce apparel and including the cotton and wool product categories that cover the majority of our products 
these quota restraints placed numerical limits on the quantity of garments permitted to be imported into the united states in a given year on a by country and by product category basis 
the effect of these quotas was to limit the amount of apparel that could be sourced in the countries that offered the most competitive fabrics and most competitive apparel manufacturing 
as a result  a substantial portion of cotton and wool apparel imported into the united states was sourced  prior to january   from countries that would not be the most competitive producers in the absence of quotas 
silk products were not subject to quota restraints 
pursuant to authority granted by china s world trade organization wto accession agreement  both the united states and the european union have re imposed quotas on a number of key product categories from china 
absent the non market restrictions created by quotas and absent duty saving advantages available with respect to the products of certain countries under the terms of various free trade agreements and trade preference arrangements  we generally believe that the most competitive fabrics and apparel manufacturing are in asia and the indian sub continent 
consequently  the elimination of quotas has resulted in a reduction in our western hemisphere sourcing and manufacturing activities and an increase in our sourcing and manufacturing activities in asia and the indian sub continent 
the trend away from western hemisphere sourcing and manufacturing may be slowed to some extent by various current and proposed free trade agreements and trade preference programs 
we believe that by selecting the locations where we produce or source our products based in part on trade regulations  we are effective and will continue to be effective in using various trade preference agreements and legislation to our competitive advantage 
we believe that with respect to most of our production  we will continue to be able to source from the most competitive countries because of the flexibility of our manufacturing and sourcing base 
this flexibility primarily arises because while we have long term relationships with many of our contract manufacturers  we do not have long term contractual commitments to them and are able to move our production to alternative locations if competitive market forces so dictate 
the relative ease with which we can exit our currently owned and contract manufacturing facilities  if necessary  provides us with the ability to shift our production relatively quickly as different countries become more competitive as a source for manufacturing 
important factors relating to risks associated with trade regulation include  but are not limited to  those described in part i  item a

risk factors our business faces certain risks  many of which are outside our control 
the following factors  as well as factors described elsewhere in this report or in our other filings with the sec  which could materially affect our business  financial condition or operating results  should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and the forward looking statements contained in this report 
the risks described below are not the only risks facing our company 
if any of the following risks  or other risks or uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial  actually occur  our business  financial condition or operating results could suffer 
the apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic cycles  which could adversely affect our sales or require us to significantly modify our current business practices 
the apparel industry is cyclical and dependent upon the overall level of discretionary consumer spending  which changes as regional  domestic and international economic conditions change 
overall economic conditions that affect discretionary consumer spending include  but are not limited to  employment levels  energy costs  interest rates  tax rates  personal debt levels and stock market volatility 
uncertainty about the future may also impact the level of discretionary consumer spending or result in shifts in consumer spending to products other than apparel 
any deterioration in general economic or political conditions  acts of war or terrorism or other factors that create uncertainty or alter the discretionary consumer habits in our key markets  particularly the united states and the united kingdom  could reduce our sales or require us to significantly modify our current business practices  and consequently harm our results of operations 

table of contents the apparel industry is highly competitive and we face significant competitive threats to our business from various third parties that could reduce our sales  increase our costs  result in reduced price points for our products and or result in decreased margins 
the apparel industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
our competitors include numerous apparel designers  manufacturers  distributors  importers  licensors  and retailers  some of which may also be our customers 
the level and nature of our competition varies and the number of our direct competitors and the intensity of competition may increase as we expand into other markets or as other companies expand into our markets 
some of our competitors may be able to adapt to changes in consumer demand more quickly  devote greater resources to establishing brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can 
in addition  with respect to certain of our businesses  retailers that are our customers may pose a significant competitive threat by sourcing their products directly or marketing their own private label brands 
these competitive factors within the apparel industry may result in reduced sales  increased costs  lower prices for our products and or decreased margins 
the apparel industry is subject to rapidly evolving fashion trends  and we must continuously offer innovative and upgraded products to maintain and grow our existing businesses 
failure to offer innovative and upgraded products may adversely affect our sales and lead to excess inventory  markdowns and or dilution of our brands 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are design  brand image  consumer preference  price  quality  marketing and customer service 
although certain of our products carry over from season to season  the apparel industry in general is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and shifting consumer demands 
accordingly  we must anticipate  identify and capitalize upon emerging as well as proven fashion trends 
we believe that our success depends on our ability to continuously develop  source  market and deliver a wide variety of innovative  fashionable and saleable brands and products 
these products must be offered at competitive prices in the respective distribution channels 
sales growth from our brands will depend largely upon our ability to continue to maintain and enhance the distinctive brand identities 
due to the competitive nature of the apparel industry  there can be no assurance that the demand for our products will not decline or that we will be able to successfully evaluate and adapt our products to align with consumers preferences  fashion trends and changes in consumer demographics 
as is typical with new products  market acceptance of new designs and products is subject to uncertainty 
in addition  the introduction of new lines and products often requires substantial costs in design  marketing and advertising  which may not be recovered if the products are not successful 
any failure on our part to develop appealing products and update core products could limit our ability to differentiate our products 
additionally  such a failure could leave us with a substantial amount of unsold excess inventory  which we may be forced to sell at lower price points 
any of these factors could result in the deterioration in the appeal of our brands and products  adversely affecting our business  financial condition and operating results 
the acquisition of new businesses has certain inherent risks  including  for example  strains on our management team  unexpected acquisition costs  and  in some instances  contingent payments 
we face many challenges in our strategy to focus more of our resources on branded products rather than private label products 
an important aspect of this strategy is our ability to acquire new businesses in the future if appropriate investment opportunities are available 
our sales growth may be limited if we are unable to find suitable acquisition candidates at reasonable prices in the future  if we are unsuccessful in integrating any acquired businesses in a timely manner or if the acquisitions do not achieve the anticipated results 
evaluating and completing acquisitions in the future may strain our administrative  operational and financial resources and distract our management from our other businesses 
in addition  integrating acquired businesses is a complex  time consuming  and expensive process 
the integration process for newly acquired businesses could create a number of challenges and adverse consequences for us associated with the integration of product lines  employees  sales teams and outsourced manufacturers  employee turnover  including key management and creative personnel of the acquired and 
table of contents existing businesses  disruption in product cycles for newly acquired product lines  maintenance of acceptable standards  controls  procedures and policies  and the impairment of relationships with customers of the acquired and existing businesses 
further  we may not be able to manage the combined operations and assets effectively or realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
as a result of acquisitions that have occurred or may occur in the future  we may become responsible for unexpected liabilities that we failed to discover in the course of performing due diligence in connection with the acquired businesses 
we cannot be assured that any indemnification to which we may be entitled from the sellers will be enforceable  collectible or sufficient in amount  scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business acquired 
similar to the terms of our acquisition of tommy bahama  the terms of any future acquisitions may require us to make substantial payments to the sellers  who may be key members of our management  in performance based contingent payments for a number of years after the acquisition 
it is possible that their interests  with respect to the contingent payments  will differ from the interests of our company as a whole 
such differences may occur if the agreements have incentives to maximize the profitability of the acquired business during the contingent payment term  which may be to the detriment of the longer term prospects for the business 
divestitures of certain businesses or discontinuations of certain product lines which occur may require us to find alternative uses for our resources 
as we did in fiscal with respect to our womenswear group operations  we may determine in the near future that it is appropriate to divest or discontinue certain operations 
divestitures of certain businesses that do not align with the strategy of our company as a whole or the discontinuation of certain product lines which may not provide the returns that we expect may result in under utilization of our resources in the event that the operations are not replaced with new lines of business either internally or through acquisition 
there can be no guarantee that if we divest certain businesses or discontinue certain product lines that we will be able to replace the sales and profits related to these businesses or to appropriately utilize our resources  which may result in a decline in our operating results 
the loss of key management or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our success depends upon disciplined execution at all levels of our organization  including our executive officers 
competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense  and we compete for these individuals with other companies which may have greater financial resources 
the unexpected loss of j 
hicks lanier  chairman and chief executive officer  or any of our other executive officers  could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
the apparel industry has experienced price deflation in recent years  and price reductions in our products in the future could put downward pressure on our net sales and margins 
the average net selling price of apparel continues to decrease in the apparel industry  particularly for private label products 
the decline is primarily attributable to increased competition  excess worldwide manufacturing capacity  increased product sourcing in lower cost countries  growth of the mass merchant and discount channels of distribution  consolidation in the retail industry  excess capacity of retail space  reduced relative spending on apparel and increased value consciousness on the part of consumers 
to remain competitive  we may need to reduce our prices from time to time in response to these deflationary pressures 
these deflationary pressures  even if met with reduced costs that do not adversely impact our sales volume  could reduce our net sales or have an adverse impact on our margins 

table of contents we depend on a group of key customers for a significant portion of our sales 
a significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer s financial position could negatively impact our net sales and profitability 
we generate a significant percentage of our sales from a few major customers  to whom we extend credit without requiring collateral  resulting in a large amount of receivables from just a few customers 
for fiscal  sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of our total net sales 
in addition  the net sales of our individual operating groups may be concentrated among several large customers 
continued consolidation in the retail industry may increase the concentration of our customers 
this consolidation could result in a decrease in the number of stores that carry our products  restructuring of our customers operations  more centralized purchasing decisions  direct sourcing and greater leverage by customers  potentially resulting in lower prices  realignment of customer affiliations or other factors which could negatively impact our net sales and profitability 
we generally do not have long term contracts with any of our customers 
instead  we rely on long standing relationships with these customers and our position within the marketplace 
as a result  purchases generally occur on an order by order basis  and each relationship can generally be terminated by either party at any time 
a decision by one or more major customers  whether motivated by competitive considerations  quality or style issues  financial difficulties  economic conditions or otherwise  could impact their desire or ability to purchase our products or change their manner of doing business with us 
an unanticipated decline in sales to one or more major customers could adversely affect our net sales and profitability  as it would be difficult to immediately  if at all  replace this business with new customers or increase sales volumes with other existing customers 
in addition  due to long product lead times  several of our product lines are designed and manufactured in anticipation of orders for sale 
we make commitments for fabric and production in connection with these lines 
these commitments can be made up to several months prior to the receipt of firm orders from customers and if orders do not materialize or are canceled  we may incur expenses to terminate our fabric and production commitments and dispose of excess inventories 
fluctuations in prices and availability of raw materials could cause delays in product deliveries to our customers and increase our costs of goods sold 
we and our third party suppliers rely on the availability of raw materials at reasonable prices 
decreases in the availability of raw materials could impair our ability to meet production requirements in a timely manner 
the principal fabrics used in our business are cotton  linens  wools  silk  other natural fibers  synthetics and blends of these materials 
the prices paid for these fabrics depend on the market price for raw materials used to produce them 
the price and availability of certain raw materials has in the past fluctuated  and may in the future fluctuate depending on a variety of factors  including crop yields  weather  supply conditions  government regulation  war  terrorism  labor unrest  global health concerns  economic climate  the cost of petroleum and other unpredictable factors 
additionally  costs of our third party providers or our transportation costs may increase due to these same factors 
we have not historically entered into any futures contracts to hedge commodity prices 
any significant increase in the price of raw materials or decrease in the availability of raw materials could cause delays in product deliveries to our customers and increase our costs of goods sold 
we are dependent upon our third party producers and sourcing agents ability to meet our requirements  any failures by these producers and sourcing agents to meet our requirements  or the unavailability of suitable producers and sourcing agents in the future  may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis or result in higher costs or reduced net sales 
we source substantially all of our products from non exclusive third party producers and sourcing agents located in foreign countries 
although we place a high value on long term relationships with our suppliers  generally we do not have long term contracts  but instead typically conduct business on an order by order basis 
therefore  we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers 

table of contents we regularly depend upon the ability of third party producers to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials  adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity 
although we monitor production in third party manufacturing locations by sending employees from our buying offices  employing local nationals and using unaffiliated buying agents  we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers  such as the reduction of availability of production capacity  errors in complying with product specifications  insufficient quality control  failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs 
such difficulties may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis  which may have a negative impact on our customer relationships and result in lower net sales 
we require third party producers to meet certain standards in terms of working conditions  environmental protection and other matters before placing business with them 
as a result of higher costs relating to compliance with these standards  we may pay higher prices than some of our competitors for products 
in addition  the labor and business practices of independent apparel manufacturers have received increased attention from the media  non governmental organizations  consumers and governmental agencies in recent years 
failure by us or our independent manufacturers to adhere to labor or other laws or business practices accepted as ethical in our key markets  and the potential litigation  negative publicity and political pressure relating to any of these events  could disrupt our operations or harm our reputation 
our reliance on foreign sourcing operations expose us to risks that could result in higher costs  loss of sales or impaired customer goodwill 
our dependence on foreign supply sources could result in disruptions to our operations in the event of disruptions in the global transportation network including strikes and work stoppages at port facilities  political instability or other international events  economic disruptions  foreign currency fluctuations  labor disputes at factories  the imposition of new or adversely adjusted tariffs  duties  quotas  import and export controls  taxes and other regulations  changes in us customs procedures concerning the importation of apparel products  changes in domestic or foreign governmental policies  actual or threatened acts of war or terrorism  or the occurrence of an epidemic 
these and other events beyond our control could interrupt our supply chain and delay receipt of our products  which could result in higher costs  including product and transportation costs  unanticipated inventory accumulation  or the loss of sales  customer orders and customer goodwill 
our business is subject to regulatory risks associated with importing products and our products may become less competitive as a result of changes in the regulatory environment 
as we source substantially all of our products from foreign countries  we are at risk to changes relating to the laws and regulations governing the importing and exporting of apparel products into and from the countries in which we operate 
substantially all of our import operations are subject to tariffs and other charges imposed on imported products 
in addition  the countries in which our products are manufactured or countries into which our products are imported may impose additional or new quotas  duties  tariffs  taxes or other restrictions or adversely modify existing restrictions 
we benefit from duty free treatment under international trade agreements and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement and the andean trade preference and drug eradication act 
the elimination of such treatment or our inability to qualify for such benefits would adversely impact our business and by increasing our cost of goods sold 
our or any of our suppliers failure to comply with customs or similar laws could restrict our ability to import products or lead to fines or other penalties 
we cannot guarantee that future regulatory actions or trade agreements will not provide our competitors with a material advantage over us or materially increase our costs 

table of contents we may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property or may otherwise have our brand names harmed 
we believe that our registered and common law trademarks and other intellectual property  as well as other contractual arrangements including licenses and other proprietary intellectual property rights  have significant value and are important to our continued success and our competitive position due to their recognition by retailers and consumers 
approximately of our net sales in fiscal was attributable to branded products for which we own the trademark 
therefore  our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property 
we rely on laws in the united states and other countries to protect our proprietary rights 
however  we may not be able to sufficiently prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization  particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
from time to time  we discover products in the marketplace that are unauthorized reproductions of certain of our branded products or that otherwise infringe upon our trademarks and other intellectual property 
such counterfeiting typically increases as brand recognition increases 
despite precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property  policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult  expensive and time consuming and we may be unable to sufficiently determine the extent of unauthorized use 
there can be no assurance that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property will be adequate to prevent the creation of counterfeits  knock offs  imitations or infringement of our products or trademarks by third parties 
from time to time  we rely on litigation and other legal action to enforce our intellectual property rights or contractual rights 
as a general matter  we may not be able to sufficiently protect the value of our intellectual property through litigation 
litigation or other legal action to enforce our intellectual property rights or contractual rights  whether successful or unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs to us and diversion of our management and other resources 
in addition  if a third party imitates certain of our products in a manner that projects a lesser quality or carries a negative connotation  this could have a material adverse effect on the goodwill of our brands in the marketplace  regardless of whether it violates our intellectual property rights 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the actions that we have taken will be adequate to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 
although we have not been materially inhibited from selling products in connection with trademark disputes  as we extend our brands into new product categories and new product lines and expand the geographic scope of our marketing  we could become subject to litigation based on allegations of the infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties 
in the event a claim of infringement against us is successful  we may be required to pay damages  royalties or license fees to continue to use intellectual property rights that we had been using or we may be unable to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or within a reasonable time 
litigation and other legal action of this type  regardless of whether it is successful  could result in substantial costs to us and diversion of our management and other resources 
we make use of debt to finance our operations  which exposes us to risks that could adversely affect our business  financial position and operating results 
our levels of debt vary as a result of the seasonality of our business  investments in acquisitions and working capital and divestitures 
our debt levels may increase in the future under our existing facilities or potentially under new facilities  or the terms or forms of our financing arrangements in the future may change  which may increase our exposure to the items discussed below 
our indebtedness includes  and any future indebtedness may include  certain obligations and limitations  including the periodic payment of principal and interest  maintenance of certain financial covenants and certain other limitations related to additional debt  dividend payments  investments and dispositions of assets 
our ability to satisfy these obligations will be dependent upon our business  financial condition and operating results 
these obligations and limitations may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness 
table of contents and limit our flexibility in carrying out our business plan and planning for  or reacting to  changes in the industry in which we operate 
as indebtedness matures  we will be required to extend or refinance such indebtedness  sell assets to repay the indebtedness or raise equity to fund the repayment of the indebtedness 
additionally  a breach of the covenants relating to our indebtedness could result in an event of default under those instruments  in some instances allowing the holders of that indebtedness to declare all outstanding indebtedness immediately due and payable 
at maturity or in the event of an acceleration of payment obligations  we would likely be unable to pay our outstanding indebtedness with our cash and cash equivalents then on hand 
we would  therefore  be required to seek alternative sources of funding  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all  or face bankruptcy 
if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness or find alternative means of financing our operations  we may be required to curtail our operations or take other actions that are inconsistent with our current business practices or strategy 
we have interest rate risk on a portion of our indebtedness  as certain of our indebtedness is based on variable interest rates 
we generally do not engage in hedging activities with respect to our interest rate risk 
an increase in interest rates may require us to pay a greater amount of our funds from operations towards interest even if the amount of borrowings outstanding remains the same 
as a result  we may have to revise or delay our business plans  reduce or delay capital expenditures or otherwise adjust our plans for operations 
our sales and operating results are influenced by weather patterns and natural disasters 
like other companies in the apparel industry  our sales volume may be adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions or natural disasters  which may cause consumers to alter their purchasing habits or result in a disruption to our operations 
because of the seasonality of our business and the concentration of a significant proportion of our customers in certain geographic regions as discussed below  the occurrence of such events could disproportionately impact our business  financial condition and operating results 
our foreign sourcing operations as well as the sale of products in foreign markets result in an exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as a result of our international operations  we are exposed to certain risks in conducting business outside of the united states 
substantially all of our contracts to have goods produced in foreign countries are denominated in us dollars 
purchase prices for our products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  such as the chinese yuan  which may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold in the future 
if the value of the us dollar decreases relative to certain foreign currencies in the future  then the prices that we negotiate for products could increase  and it is possible that we would not be able to pass this increase on to customers  which would negatively impact our margins 
if the value of the us dollar increases between the time a price is set and payment for a product  the price we pay may be higher than that paid for comparable goods by any competitors that pay for goods in local currencies  and these competitors may be able to sell their products at more competitive prices 
additionally  currency fluctuations could also disrupt the business of our independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and difficult to finance 
we received us dollars for greater than of our product sales during fiscal the sales denominated in foreign currencies primarily relate to ben sherman sales in the united kingdom and europe 
an increase in the value of the us dollar compared to these other currencies in which we have sales could result in lower levels of sales and earnings in our consolidated statements of earnings  although the sales in foreign currencies could be equal to or greater than amounts in prior periods 
we generally do not engage in hedging activities with respect to our exposure to foreign currency risk except that  on occasion  we do purchase foreign currency forward exchange contracts for our goods purchased on us dollar terms that are expected to be sold in the united kingdom and europe 

table of contents we are dependent on a limited number of distribution centers  making our operations particularly susceptible to disruption 
our ability to meet customer expectations  manage inventory and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of our primary distribution facilities  some of which are owned and others of which are operated by third parties 
finished garments from our contractors are inspected and stored at these distribution facilities 
if any of these distribution facilities were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason  we could experience a reduction in sales  a substantial loss of inventory or higher costs and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products during the time it takes to reopen or replace the facility 
this could negatively affect our operating results and our customer relationships 
we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our brands and as a source of royalty income 
certain of our brands  such as tommy bahama and ben sherman  have a reputation of outstanding quality and name recognition  which make the brands valuable as a source of royalty income 
we are able to license complementary products and obtain royalty income from the use of our brands names 
while we take significant steps to ensure the reputation of our brands is maintained through our license agreements  there can be no guarantee our brands will not be negatively impacted through our association with products outside of our core apparel products or due to the actions of a licensee 
the improper or detrimental actions of a licensee may not only result in a decrease in the sales of our licensee s products but also could significantly impact the perception of our brands 
if the licensees products are not acceptable to consumers  if the licensee s actions are detrimental to our brands or if we do not add new license agreements  our net sales  royalty income and reputation could be negatively impacted 
we hold licenses for the use of other parties brand names  and we cannot guarantee our continued use of such brand names or the quality or salability of such brand names 
we have entered into license and design agreements to use certain trademarks and trade names  such as nautica  kenneth cole  tommy hilfiger  dockers  o oscar  geoffrey beene and evisu  to market our products 
approximately of our net sales during fiscal related to the products for which we license the use of the trademark for specific product categories 
these license and design agreements will expire at various dates in the future 
although we believe our relationships with our principal licensors are generally favorable  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew these licenses on acceptable terms upon expiration or that we will be able to acquire new licenses to use other popular trademarks 
if any one or more of these licenses expires or is terminated  we will lose the sales and profits generated pursuant to such license 
in addition to certain compliance obligations  all of our significant licenses provide minimum thresholds for royalty payments and advertising expenditures for each license year  which we must pay regardless of the level of our sales of the licensed products 
if these thresholds are not met due to a general economic downturn or otherwise  our licensors may be permitted contractually to terminate these agreements or seek payment of minimum royalties even if the minimum sales are not achieved 
in addition  our licensors produce their own products and license their trademarks to other third parties  and we are unable to control the quality of goods that others produce 
if licensors or others do not maintain the quality of these trademarks or if the brand image deteriorates  our sales and profits generated by such brands may decline 
we may not be successful in operating existing retail stores and restaurants or in opening new retail stores and restaurants 
an integral part of our strategy is to develop and operate retail stores and restaurants for certain of our brands 
net sales from retail stores and restaurants were approximately of our consolidated net sales during fiscal in addition to the general risks associated with the apparel industry  risks associated with our retail and restaurant operations include our ability to find and select appropriate locations 
other risks include our ability to negotiate acceptable lease terms  build out the facilities  source sufficient levels of consumer desirable inventory  hire  train and retain competent personnel  abide by applicable labor laws  
table of contents install and operate effective technology systems  and apply appropriate pricing strategies 
retail stores and restaurants involve a significant capital investment and incur significant fixed operating expenditures  including obligations under long term leases 
we cannot be sure that our current locations will be profitable or that we can successfully complete our planned expansion 
in addition  as we expand the number of our retail stores  we run the risk that our wholesale customers will perceive that we are increasingly competing directly with them  which may lead them to reduce or terminate purchases of our products 
our concentration of retail stores and wholesale customers for certain of our products exposes us to certain regional risks 
our retail locations are heavily concentrated in certain geographic areas in the united states  including florida  california and hawaii  for our tommy bahama retail stores and the united kingdom for our ben sherman retail stores 
additionally  a significant portion of our wholesale sales for tommy bahama and ben sherman products are concentrated in the same geographic areas 
due to this concentration  we have exposure to factors that impact these regions  including general economic conditions  weather patterns  natural disasters and other factors 
our restaurant operations may be negatively impacted by regulatory issues or by health  safety  labor and similar operational issues  or by publicity surrounding any of these issues 
the restaurant industry is highly competitive and requires compliance with a variety of federal  state and local regulations 
in particular  our tommy bahama restaurants typically serve alcohol and  therefore  maintain liquor licenses 
our ability to maintain our liquor licenses depends on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
the loss of a liquor license would adversely affect the profitability of a restaurant 
additionally  as a participant in the restaurant industry  we face risks related to food quality  food borne illness  injury  health inspection scores and labor relations 
regardless of whether allegations related to these matters are valid or whether we become liable  we may be materially and adversely affected by negative publicity associated with these issues 
the negative impact of adverse publicity relating to one restaurant may extend beyond the restaurant involved to affect some or all of the other restaurants  as well as the image of the tommy bahama brand as a whole 
we operate in various countries with differing laws and regulations  which may impair our ability to maintain compliance with regulations and laws 
although we attempt to abide by the laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate  the complexity of the laws and regulations to which we are subject  including customs regulations  labor laws  competition laws  and domestic and international tax legislation  makes it difficult for us to ensure that we are currently  or will be in the future  compliant with all laws and regulations 
we may be required to make significant expenditures or modify our business practices to comply with existing or future laws or regulations  and unfavorable resolution to litigation or a violation of applicable laws and regulations may increase our costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business 
our operations are reliant on information technology  and any interruption or other failure in our information technology systems may impair our ability to compete effectively in the apparel industry  including our ability to provide services to our customers and meet the needs of management 
the efficient operation of our business is dependent on information technology 
information systems are used in all stages of our operations from design to distribution and as a method of communication with our customers and suppliers as well as our domestic and foreign employees 
we also rely on information systems to provide relevant and accurate information to our management in order to allocate resources and forecast and report our operating results 
service interruptions may occur as a result of a number of factors  including computer viruses  hacking or other unlawful activities by third parties  disasters  or failures to properly install  upgrade  integrate  protect  repair or maintain our systems 
we periodically assess the appropriateness and relevance of our current financial and operational systems  which could result in a change to or replacement of these systems in the future 
in doing so  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in developing or 
table of contents acquiring competitive systems which are responsive to our needs and the needs of our customers 
any interruption  or other failure  of critical business information systems  including an interruption or failure caused by our inability to successfully upgrade or change our financial or operational systems  could cause difficulties in operating our business and communicating with our customers  which could cause our sales and profits to decrease

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our operations  cash flows  liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
overview we generate revenues and cash flow through the design  sale  production and distribution of branded and private label consumer apparel and footwear for men  women and children and the licensing of company owned trademarks 
our principal markets and customers are located primarily in the united states and  to a lesser extent  the united kingdom 
we source substantially all of our products through third party producers in foreign countries 
we primarily distribute our products through our wholesale customers which include chain stores  department stores  specialty stores  specialty catalog retailers  mass merchants and internet retailers 
we also sell products of certain of our owned brands through our own retail stores 
we operate in an industry that is highly competitive 
we believe our ability to continuously evaluate and respond to changing consumer demands and tastes across multiple market segments  distribution channels and geographic regions is critical to our success 
although our approach is aimed at diversifying our risks  misjudging shifts in consumer preferences could have a negative affect on future operating results 
other key aspects of competition include brand image  quality  distribution method  price  customer service and intellectual property protection 
we believe our size and global operating strategies help us to compete successfully by providing opportunities for operating synergies 
our success in the future will depend on our ability to continue to design products that are acceptable to the markets we serve and to source our products on a competitive basis while still earning appropriate margins 
we are executing a strategy to move towards a business model that is more focused on brands owned or controlled by us 
our decision to follow this strategy is driven in part by the continued consolidation in the retail industry and the increasing concentration of apparel manufacturing in a relatively limited number of offshore markets  trends which make the private label business increasingly more competitively challenging 
significant steps in our execution of this strategy include our june acquisition of tommy bahama  our july acquisition of ben sherman  the divestiture of our private label womenswear group in june  the closure of certain of our manufacturing facilities located in latin america and the associated shifts in our oxford apparel and lanier clothes operating groups towards package purchases from third party manufacturers primarily in the far east  and the acquisition of several other trademarks and related operations including solitude  arnold brant and hathaway 
in the future  we will continue to look for opportunities by which we can make further progress with this strategy  including through organic growth in our owned brands  the acquisition of additional brands  and further streamlining of portions of our private label businesses that do not have the potential to meet our operating income expectations 
the most significant factors impacting our results and contributing to the change in diluted net earnings from continuing operations per common share of in fiscal from in fiscal were a million  or  increase in the operating income of tommy bahama primarily due to the increased sales and a reduction in intangible asset amortization expense  a million  or  decrease in the operating income of ben sherman primarily as a result of a reduction in net sales and operating income in the united kingdom and the united states  a million  or  decrease in the operating income of lanier clothes primarily due to the challenging conditions and sluggish demand in the tailored clothing market in fiscal  a million  or  increase in operating income in oxford apparel primarily due to a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses and the purchase of a two thirds interest in the entity that owns the hathaway trademark in the united states and certain other countries  and an effective tax rate of and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively

ben sherman reported a decrease in net sales of million  or 
the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in unit sales of resulting from a unit sales decline in the united kingdom and the united states 
this decline was primarily due to the continued weakness in the united kingdom apparel market through much of fiscal and our efforts to restrict distribution of ben sherman products and decreases inventory levels at retail in the united states

table of contents amortization of intangible assets decreased in fiscal the change was primarily due to certain intangible assets acquired as part of our previous acquisitions  which generally have a greater amount of amortization in the earlier periods following the acquisition than later periods 
we expect that amortization expense will decrease in future years unless we acquire additional intangible assets with definite lives 
royalties and other operating income increased in fiscal the increase was primarily due to our share of equity income received from an unconsolidated entity that owns the hathaway trademark in the united states and several other countries  which was acquired in the first quarter of fiscal  and a pre tax gain of million on the sale of our monroe  georgia facility in fiscal operating income increased in fiscal due to the changes discussed below

table of contents costs of approximately million associated with the consolidation of certain support functions in oxford apparel  and operating expenses of the arnold brant business in lanier clothes which has a higher sg a structure than the rest of lanier clothes 
amortization of intangible assets decreased in fiscal the decrease was due to certain intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions of tommy bahama and ben sherman  which have a greater amount of amortization in the earlier periods following the acquisition than later periods 
this decline was partially offset by recognizing amortization related to the intangible assets acquired in the ben sherman transaction for the entire period during the twelve months of fiscal compared to only ten months in the prior year

our debt to total capitalization ratio was and at june  and june   respectively 
the change in this ratio was primarily a result of cash flows from operations during fiscal and the net assets related to the discontinued operations of the womenswear group at june  being converted into cash during fiscal our debt level  as well as the ratio of debt to total capitalization  in future years may not be comparable to the balance at june  as we continuously assess and periodically make changes to our capital structure and may make additional acquisitions or investments in the future 
we anticipate that we will be able to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements  which generally consist of working capital needs  capital expenditures primarily for the opening of additional tommy bahama and ben sherman retail stores and interest payments on our debt during the next twelve months  primarily from cash on hand and cash flow from operations supplemented by borrowings under our lines of credit  if necessary 
our need for working capital is typically seasonal with the greatest requirements generally existing from the late second quarter to early fourth quarter of each year as we build inventory for the spring summer season 
our capital needs will depend on many factors including our growth rate  the need to finance increased inventory levels and the success of our various products 
if appropriate investment opportunities arise that exceed the availability under our existing credit facilities  we believe that we will be able to fund such acquisitions through additional or refinanced debt facilities or the issuance of additional equity 
however  our ability to obtain additional borrowings or refinance our credit facilities will depend on many factors  including the prevailing market conditions  our financial condition and our ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions 
there is no assurance that financing would be available on terms that are acceptable or favorable to us  if at all 
at maturity of the us revolver  the us revolver and the senior unsecured notes  we anticipate that we will be able to refinance the facilities and debt with terms available in the market at that time

off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into agreements which meet the sec s definition of an off balance sheet financing arrangement  other than operating leases  and have made no financial commitments to or guarantees with any unconsolidated subsidiaries or special purpose entities 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to receivables  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation and other accrued expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that we have appropriately applied our critical accounting policies 
however  in the event that inappropriate assumptions or methods were used relating to the critical accounting policies below  our consolidated statements of earnings could be misstated 
the detailed summary of significant accounting policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods we use 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable our revenue consists of wholesale  retail store and restaurant sales 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  our price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for sales within our wholesale operations  we consider a completed purchase order or some form of electronic communication from the customer requesting the goods persuasive evidence of an agreement 
for substantially all of our wholesale sales  our products are considered sold and delivered at the time that the products are shipped as substantially all products are sold based on fob shipping point terms 
this generally coincides with the time that title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer 
for certain transactions in which the goods do not pass through our owned or third distribution centers and title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass at the time the goods leave the foreign port  revenue is recognized at that time 
in certain cases in which we retain the risk of loss during shipment  revenue recognition does not occur until the goods have reached the specified customer 
retail store revenue  net of estimated returns  and restaurant revenues are recorded at the time of sale to consumers 
retail store and restaurant revenues are recorded net of applicable sales taxes in our consolidated statements of earnings 
in the normal course of business we offer certain discounts or allowances to our wholesale customers 
wholesale operations sales are recorded net of such discounts  allowances  advertising support not specifically 
table of contents relating to the reimbursement for actual advertising expenses by our customers and provisions for estimated returns 
as certain allowances and other deductions are not finalized until the end of a season  program or other event which may not have occurred yet  we estimate such discounts and allowances on an ongoing basis considering historical and current trends  projected seasonal results and other factors 
we record the discounts  returns and allowances as a reduction to net sales in our consolidated statements of earnings 
in circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve for bad debts is taken as a reduction to accounts receivable to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
such amounts are written off at the time that the amounts are not considered collectible 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts and uncollectible chargebacks based on our historical collection experience  the financial condition of our customers  an evaluation of current economic conditions and anticipated trends 
we record such charges and write offs to selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings 
we have determined that gift card balances are unlikely to be redeemed once they have been outstanding for four years and therefore may be recognized as income  subject to applicable laws in certain states 
gift card breakage is included in net sales in our consolidated statements of earnings 
royalties  which are generally based on the greater of a percentage of the licensee s actual net sales or a contractually determined minimum royalty amount  are recorded based upon the guaranteed minimum levels and adjusted as sales data is received from licensees 
we may receive initial payments for the grant of license rights  which are recognized as revenue over the term of the license agreement 
such income is included in royalties and other income in our consolidated statements of earnings 
inventories for operating group reporting  inventory is carried at the lower of fifo cost or market 
we continually evaluate the composition of our inventories for identification of distressed inventory 
for wholesale inventory  we estimate the amount of goods that we will not be able to sell in the normal course of business and write down the value of these goods 
for retail inventory  we provide an allowance for shrinkage and goods expected to be sold below cost 
each of these estimates are based on our historical experience as well as an assessment of the inventory quantity  quality and mix  consumer and retailer preferences and the current market conditions 
for consolidated financial reporting  significant portions of our inventories are valued at the lower of lifo cost or market 
lifo inventory calculations are made on a legal entity basis which does not correspond to our operating group definitions 
therefore  lifo inventory accounting adjustments are not allocated to the respective operating groups 
as part of lifo accounting  markdowns for inventory valued at lifo cost are deferred until the period in which the goods are sold 
however  in non routine circumstances  such as discontinuance of a product line  markdowns below the allocated lifo reserve are not deferred 
both the lifo reserve and the markdown deferral are reflected in corporate and other for operating group reporting purposes included in note to our consolidated financial statements and in the results of operations in our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this report 
goodwill  net goodwill is recognized as the amount by which the cost to acquire a company or group of assets exceeds the fair value of assets acquired less any liabilities assumed at acquisition 
such goodwill is allocated to the respective reporting unit at the time of acquisition 
goodwill is not amortized but instead evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired 
the evaluation of the recoverability of goodwill includes valuations of each applicable underlying business using fair value techniques and market comparables which may include a discounted cash flow analysis or an independent appraisal 
the discount rate used in this analysis is an estimate of the risk adjusted market based cost of capital 
if this analysis indicates an impairment of goodwill balances  the impairment is recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
intangible assets  net at acquisition  we estimate and record the fair value of purchased intangible assets  which primarily consist of trademarks and trade names  license agreements and customer relationships 
the fair values of these 
table of contents intangible assets are estimated based on management s assessment as well as independent third party appraisals in some cases 
such valuation may include a discounted cash flow analysis of anticipated revenues or cost savings resulting from the acquired intangible asset using an estimate of a risk adjusted market based cost of capital as the discount rate 
amortization of intangible assets with finite lives  which consist of license agreements  certain trademarks  customer relationships and covenants not to compete  is recognized over their estimated useful lives using a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise realized 
we amortize our intangible assets with finite lives for periods of up to years 
intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment periodically if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if expected future undiscounted cash flows from operations are less than their carrying amounts  an asset is determined to be impaired and a loss is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
trademarks and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the intangible asset might be impaired 
the evaluation of the recoverability of intangible assets with indefinite lives includes valuations based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
the fair values of trademarks are estimated on an annual basis utilizing the relief from royalty method 
if this analysis indicates an impairment of an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life  the amount of the impairment is recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the difference between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the period in which such amounts are expected to be realized or settled 
our policy is to recognize net deferred tax assets  whose realization is dependent on taxable earnings in future years  when a greater than probability exists that the tax benefits will actually be realized sometime in the future 
we also provide for a reserve for items when a greater than probability exists that a tax deduction taken would be disallowed under examination by the taxing authority 
no material valuation allowances have been recognized in our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of recent accounting pronouncements 
seasonality although our various product lines are sold on a year round basis  the demand for specific products or styles may be highly seasonal 
for example  the demand for golf and tommy bahama products is higher in the spring and summer seasons 
products are sold prior to each of the retail selling seasons  including spring  summer  fall and holiday 
as the timing of product shipments and other events affecting the retail business may vary  results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year 
the percentage of net sales by quarter for fiscal was  and  respectively  and the percentage of operating income by quarter for fiscal was   and  respectively  which may not be indicative of the distribution in future years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk trade policy risk pursuant to the agreement on textiles and clothing  quotas among world trade organization  or wto  member countries  including the united states  were eliminated on january  as a result  the 
table of contents international textile and apparel trade is undergoing a significant realignment which is changing our sourcing patterns  could disrupt our supply chain and could put us at a disadvantage to our competitors 
in addition  notwithstanding quota elimination  under the terms of china s wto accession agreement  the united states and other wto members may re impose quotas on specific categories of products in the event it is determined that imports from china have surged or may surge and are threatening to create a market disruption for such categories of products so called safeguard quota 
pursuant to this authority  both the united states and the european union re imposed quotas on several important product categories from china during calendar subsequent to the imposition of safeguard quotas  both the united states and china negotiated bilateral quota agreements that cover a number of important product categories and will remain in place until december  in the case of the us china bilateral agreement and until december  in the case of the european union china bilateral agreement 
the establishment of these quotas could cause disruption in our supply chain 
also  until december  the eu and any other wto country  can invoke a product specific safeguard mechanism on any such products  including textile and apparel products  that are being imported from china in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause market disruption to the domestic producers as a whole of like or directly competitive products 
relief may come in the form of additional duties or a quota and may remain in place for either two years or three years depending on whether the increase in imports is absolute  or relative  compared to world imports 
any such additional duties or quota could cause disruption in our supply chain as well 
we benefit from duty free treatment under international trade agreements and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement and the andean trade preference and drug eradication act 
the elimination of such treatment or our inability to qualify for such benefits would adversely impact our business and by increasing our cost of goods sold 
furthermore  under long standing statutory authority applicable to imported goods in general  the united states may unilaterally impose additional duties i when imported merchandise is sold at less than fair value and causes material injury  or threatens to cause material injury  to the domestic industry producing a comparable product generally known as anti dumping duties  or ii when foreign producers receive certain types of governmental subsidies  and when the importation of their subsidized goods causes material injury  or threatens to cause material injury  to the domestic industry producing a comparable product generally known as countervailing duties 
the imposition of anti dumping or countervailing duties on products we import would increase the cost of those products to us 
we may not be able to pass on any such cost increase to our customers 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our indebtedness  which could impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods 
our objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow  primarily through a mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
this assessment also considers our need for flexibility in our borrowing arrangements resulting from the seasonality of our business  among other factors 
we continuously monitor interest rates to consider the sources and terms of our borrowing facilities in order to determine whether we have achieved our interest rate management objectives 
as of june   we did not have any debt outstanding subject to variable interest rates 
our average variable rate borrowings for fiscal were million  with an average interest rate of during the period 
our lines of credit are based on variable interest rates in order to provide the necessary borrowing flexibility we require 
to the extent that the amounts outstanding under our variable rate lines of credit change  our exposure to changes in interest rates would also change 
if our average interest rate for fiscal increased by basis points  our interest expense would have been approximately million higher during the fiscal year 
interest expense in fiscal may not be indicative of interest expense in future years  particularly if we acquire additional businesses or change our capital structure 
at june   we had approximately million of fixed rate debt and capital lease obligations outstanding with substantially all the debt  consisting of our senior unsecured notes  having an effective 
table of contents interest rate of and maturing in june such agreements may result in higher interest expense than could be obtained under variable interest rate arrangements in certain periods  but are primarily intended to provide long term financing of our capital structure and minimize our exposure to increases in interest rates 
a change in the market interest rate impacts the fair value of our fixed rate debt but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
none of our debt was entered into for speculative purposes 
we generally do not engage in hedging activities with respect to our interest rate risk and do not enter into such transactions on a speculative basis 
foreign currency risk to the extent that we have assets and liabilities  as well as operations  denominated in foreign currencies that are not hedged  we are subject to foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses 
we view our foreign investments as long term and as a result we generally do not hedge such foreign investments 
we do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments related to foreign currency exposure for speculative purposes 
we receive united states dollars for most of our product sales 
less than of our net sales during fiscal were denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
these sales primarily relate to ben sherman sales in the united kingdom and europe 
with the united states dollar trading at a weaker position than it has historically traded versus the pound sterling and the canadian dollar  a strengthening united states dollar could result in lower levels of sales and earnings in our consolidated statements of earnings in future periods  although the sales in foreign currencies could be equal to or greater than amounts as previously reported 
based on our fiscal sales denominated in foreign currencies  if the dollar had strengthened by in fiscal  we would have experienced a decrease in sales of approximately million 
substantially all of our inventory purchases from contract manufacturers throughout the world are denominated in united states dollars 
purchase prices for our products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold in the future 
due to the number of currencies involved and the fact that not all foreign currencies react in the same manner against the united states dollar  we cannot quantify in any meaningful way the potential effect of such fluctuations on future costs 
however  we do not believe that exchange rate fluctuations will have a material impact on our inventory costs in future periods 
we may from time to time purchase short term foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates  but at june   we have not entered into any such agreements that have not been settled 
during fiscal  foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding did not exceed million at any time 
when such contracts are outstanding  the contracts are marked to market with the offset being recognized in our consolidated statement of earnings or other comprehensive income if the transaction does not or does  respectively  qualify as a hedge in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
commodity and inflation risk we are affected by inflation and changing prices primarily through the purchase of raw materials and finished goods and increased operating costs to the extent that any such fluctuations are not reflected by adjustments in the selling prices of our products 
also  in recent years  there has been deflationary pressure on selling prices  particularly in our private label businesses 
while we have been successful to some extent in offsetting such deflationary pressures through product improvements and lower costs  if deflationary price trends outpace our ability to obtain further price reductions  our profitability may be adversely affected 
inflation deflation risks are managed by each operating group through selective price increases when possible  productivity improvements and cost containment initiatives 
we do not enter into significant long term sales or purchase contracts and we do not engage in hedging activities with respect to such risk
