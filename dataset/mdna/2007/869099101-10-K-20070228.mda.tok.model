the following discussion and analysis  the purpose of which is to provide investors and others with information that we believe to be necessary for an understanding of susquehanna s financial condition  changes in financial condition  and results of operations  should be read in conjunction with the financial statements  notes  and other information contained in this document

table of contents critical accounting estimates susquehanna s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles involves significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
the judgments and assumptions that we used are based on historical experiences and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions that we have made  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 
our most critical accounting estimates are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
furthermore  we believe that the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the valuation of recorded interests in securitized assets to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments 
the treatment of securitizations and off balance sheet financing is discussed in detail in the section titled securitizations and off balance sheet financings 
the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan and lease portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan and lease losses 
recorded interests in securitized assets are established and accounted for based on discounted cash flow modeling techniques which require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  including assumptions about repayment rates  credit loss experience  and discount rates that consider the risk involved 
since the values of these assets are sensitive to changes in assumptions  the valuation of recorded interests in securitized assets is considered a critical accounting estimate 
note and the section titled securitizations and off balance sheet financings provide additional information regarding recorded interests 
any material effect on the consolidated financial statements related to these critical accounting areas is also discussed within the body of this document 
executive overview in april  we completed the acquisition of minotola national bank in southern new jersey  adding fourteen branches to our network 
furthermore  we saw improved results at our auto leasing subsidiary  hann financial service corp 
hann s pre tax loss for was less than we originally projected  and we forecast a return to profitability in  assuming the same volume of lease production 

table of contents the following table compares our financial goals to actual results goal actual net interest margin loan growth adjusted for securitizations deposit growth adjusted for branch sales noninterest income growth securitization gains million million noninterest expense growth tax rate excludes the effect of the acquisition of minotola national bank 
we were pleased to be able to produce strong loan growth for  although deposit growth fell short of our expectations 
accordingly  we will make generation of core deposits a primary focus of our marketing efforts in our plans call for a relationship based approach meant to provide superior service and to increase customer and account retention 
in addition  we will initiate direct marketing programs and other promotions to expand customer relationships and attract new prospects 
in terms of credit quality  we experienced an increase in non accruing loans  however  this increase is concentrated primarily in loans that are well collateralized  and we do not expect to see any significant losses as a result of these credits 
our financial goals for are as follows goal net interest margin loan growth adjusted for securitizations deposit growth noninterest income growth noninterest expense growth tax rate these financial goals include million of securitization gains 
the timing and amount of these associated securitizations  which we use as a funding source and a means to manage capital  are difficult to predict 
consequently  quarterly earnings will fluctuate 
acquisitions minotola national bank on april   we acquired minotola national bank in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately million 
the acquisition of minotola  with total assets of million and fourteen branch locations  significantly enhances our presence in the high growth markets in southern new jersey 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method  and all transactions since that date are included in our consolidated financial statements 
the acquisition of minotola is considered immaterial for purposes of the disclosures required by fas no

supplemental reporting of non gaap based financial measures return on average tangible equity is a non gaap based financial measure calculated using non gaap amounts 
the most directly comparable gaap based measure is return on average equity 
we calculate return on average tangible equity by excluding the balance of intangible assets and their related amortization expense from our calculation of return on average equity 
management uses the return on average tangible equity in order to review our core operating results 
management believes that this is a better measure of our performance 
in addition  this is consistent with the treatment by bank regulatory agencies  which excludes goodwill and other intangible assets from the calculation of risk based capital ratios 
a reconciliation of return on average equity to return on average tangible equity is set forth below 
return on average equity gaap basis effect of excluding average intangible assets and related amortization return on average tangible equity 
table of contents efficiency ratio excluding hann is a non gaap based financial measure calculated using non gaap amounts 
the most directly comparable gaap based measure is the efficiency ratio 
we measure our efficiency ratio by dividing noninterest expenses by the sum of net interest income  on an fte basis  and noninterest income 
the presentation of an efficiency ratio excluding hann is computed as the efficiency ratio excluding the effect of hann 
management believes this to be a preferred measure because it excludes the volatility of vehicle residual values and vehicle delivery and preparation expense of hann and provides better visibility into our core business activities 
a reconciliation of efficiency ratio to efficiency ratio excluding hann is set forth below 
efficiency ratio gaap basis effect of excluding hann efficiency ratio excluding hann net interest income taxable equivalent basis our major source of operating revenues is net interest income  which increased to million in  as compared to million in net interest income as a percentage of net interest income plus other income was for the twelve months ended december   for the twelve months ended december   and for the twelve months ended december  net interest income is the income that remains after deducting  from total income generated by earning assets  the interest expense attributable to the acquisition of the funds required to support earning assets 
income from earning assets includes income from loans  investment securities  and short term investments 
the amount of interest income is dependent upon many factors including the volume of earning assets  the general level of interest rates  the dynamics of the change in interest rates  and the levels of non performing loans 
the cost of funds varies with the amount of funds necessary to support earning assets  the rates paid to attract and hold deposits  the rates paid on borrowed funds  and the levels of noninterest bearing demand deposits and equity capital 
table presents average balances  taxable equivalent interest income and expense and yields earned or paid on these assets and liabilities 
for purposes of calculating taxable equivalent interest income  tax exempt interest has been adjusted using a marginal tax rate of in order to equate the yield to that of taxable interest rates 
table illustrates the changes in net interest income caused by changes in average volume  rates  and yields 
the million increase in our net interest income in  as compared to  was primarily the result of the net contribution from interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities acquired from minotola in april in addition  our net interest margin improved slightly  from for  to for this increase in net interest margin was also primarily due to the acquisition of minotola

provision and allowance for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses is the expense necessary to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level adequate to absorb management s estimate of probable losses in the loan and lease portfolio 
our provision for loan and lease losses is based upon management s quarterly review of the loan portfolio 
the purpose of the review is to assess loan quality  identify impaired loans and leases  analyze delinquencies  ascertain loan and lease growth  evaluate potential charge offs and recoveries  and assess general economic conditions in the markets we serve 
commercial loans and commercial real estate loans are internally risk rated  using a standard rating system  by our loan officers and periodically reviewed by loan quality personnel 
consumer loans  residential real estate loans  and leases are generally analyzed in the aggregate as they are of relatively small dollar size and homogeneous in nature 
under our methodology for calculating the allowance for loan and lease losses  loss rates for the last three years on a rolling quarter to quarter basis are determined for a commercial credits including agriculture  commercial  commercial real estate  land acquisition  development and construction and b consumer credits 
table of contents including residential real estate  consumer direct  consumer indirect  consumer revolving  and leases 
the loss rates are calculated for each affiliate bank  and they are applied to loan balances of the portfolio segments described above 
in addition to using loss rates  non accrual loans of million or greater are reviewed for impairment as required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan fas no 

those loans that have specific loss allocations are identified and included in the reserve allocation 
risk rated loans that are not reviewed for impairment are segregated into homogeneous pools with loss allocation rates that reflect the severity of risk 
loss rates are adjusted by applying other factors to the calculations 
these factors include adjustment for current economic trends  delinquency and risk trends  credit concentrations  credit administration and other special allocations for unusual events or changes in products 
this methodology provides an in depth analysis of the portfolios of our banks and reflects the estimated losses within the various portfolios 
reserve allocations are then reviewed and consolidated 
this process is performed on a quarterly basis  including a risk rated review of commercial credit relationships at the banking affiliates 
determining the level of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses at any given point in time is difficult  particularly during uncertain economic periods 
we must make estimates using assumptions and information that is often subjective and changing rapidly 
the review of the loan and lease portfolios is a continuing event in light of a changing economy and the dynamics of the banking and regulatory environment 
in our opinion  the allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate to meet probable loan and lease losses at december  there can be no assurance  however  that we will not sustain losses in future periods that could be greater than the size of the allowance at december  as illustrated in table  the provision for loan and lease losses was million for  and million in this million decrease in the provision was the result of a million decrease in net charge offs in  as compared to the comparative decrease in net charge offs was caused by a million net charge off related to one customer in the telecommunications industry in  and fewer problem loans with collateral shortfalls in

in addition  regulatory authorities  as an integral part of their examinations  periodically review the level of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
they may require additions to allowances based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of examination 

table of contents it is our policy not to renegotiate the terms of a commercial loan simply because of a delinquency status 
rather  a commercial loan is typically transferred to non accrual status if it is not well secured and in the process of collection  and is considered delinquent in payment if either principal or interest is past due days or more 
interest income received on impaired commercial loans in and  was million and million  respectively 
interest income that would have been recorded on these loans under the original terms was million and million for and  respectively 
at december   we had no outstanding commitments to advance additional funds with respect to these impaired loans 
consumer loans are typically charged off when they are days past due unless they are secured by real estate 
loans secured by real estate are evaluated on the basis of collateral value 
loans that are well secured may continue to accrue interest  while other loans are charged down to net realizable value or placed on non accrual depending upon their loan to value ratio 
table is an analysis of the provision levels as well as the activity in the allowance for loan and lease losses for the past five years 
table reflects the five year history of non performing assets and loans and leases contractually past due days and not placed on non accrual 
at december   non performing assets totaled million and included million in other real estate acquired through foreclosure and million in restructured loans 
at december   non performing assets totaled million  and included million in other real estate acquired through foreclosure 
the increase in non performing assets is concentrated primarily in loans that are well collateralized  and we consider reserves against these loans to be adequate 
table non performing assets at december  dollars in thousands loans contractually past due days and still accruing non performing assets nonaccrual loans commercial  financial  and agricultural real estate construction real estate secured residential real estate secured commercial consumer leases restructured loans other real estate owned total non performing assets total non performing assets as a percentage of period end loans and leases and other real estate owned allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of non performing loans and leases real estate acquired through foreclosure is recorded at the lower of its carrying value or the fair market value of the property at the transfer date  as determined by a current appraisal  less estimated costs to sell 
prior to foreclosure  the recorded amount of the loan is written down  if necessary  to fair value by charging the allowance for loan and lease losses 
subsequent to foreclosure  gains or losses on the sale of real estate acquired through foreclosure are recorded in operating income  and any losses determined as a result of periodic valuations are charged to other operating expense 

table of contents loans with principal and or interest delinquent days or more and still accruing interest totaled million at december   a slight increase from million at december  a softening of certain segments of the economy may adversely affect certain borrowers and may cause additional loans to become past due beyond days or be placed on non accrual status because of the uncertainty of receiving full payment of either principal or interest on these loans 
potential problem loans consist of loans that are performing under contract but for which potential credit problems have caused us to place them on our internally monitored loan list 
these loans  which are not included in table  totaled million at december   and million at december  the increase of million can be attributed to two borrowing relationships totaling million 
these loans continue to perform and are adequately secured by collateral 
the balance of million represents loans acquired in the minotola acquisition and changes to our internally monitored loan list that occur in the normal course of business 
depending upon the state of the economy and its impact on these borrowers  as well as future events  such as regulatory examination assessments  these loans and others not currently so identified could be classified as non performing assets in the future 
noninterest income noninterest income  as a percentage of net interest income plus noninterest income  was   and for   and  respectively 
noninterest income increased million  or  in  over this net increase primarily is composed of the following increased service charges on deposit accounts of million  increased vehicle origination  servicing  and securitization fees of million  increased commissions on property and casualty insurance sales of million  increased gains on sales of loans and leases of million  decreased gains on securities of million  and increased other income of million 
service charges on deposit accounts 
the increase was the result of improvements relating to the processing of customer overdrafts and the inclusion of minotola operations since april  vehicle origination  securitization  and servicing fees 
the increase in vehicle origination  servicing  and securitization fees was primarily due to higher unit volumes of lease originations and increased securitization fees 
commissions on property and casualty insurance sales 
the increase in commissions on property and casualty insurance sales is attributed to new business and better than expected contingency fee income in the first quarter of gains on sales of loans and leases 
the increase in gains on sales of loans and leases can be attributed to million in gains recognized on subsequent draws conveyed to the home equity securitization trusts throughout gains on securities 
in december  we recognized an other than temporary impairment of million relating to our corporate investment committee s decision to implement a modest restructuring program of our federal agency debenture portfolio in this restructuring program included the january sale of federal agency debentures classified as available for sale with an aggregate book value of million and unrealized losses of million at december  
table of contents furthermore  in  we made a determination  based upon market conditions  the interest rate environment  and our objective to shorten the duration of our investment portfolio  that it was an opportune time to sell certain municipal and mortgage backed securities 
accordingly  we sold securities with a book value of million and recognized net gains of million 
other income 
the increase primarily was the result of the inclusion of minotola operations  most notably the merchant services division which contributed million to other income  since april  furthermore  the rewards program associated with our susquehanna branded debit cards generated an additional million 
noninterest expenses noninterest expenses increased million  or  in  over this net increase primarily is composed of the following increased salaries and employee benefits of million  increased occupancy expense of million  decreased vehicle residual value expense of million  and increased other expenses of million 
salaries and employee benefits 
the largest component of noninterest expense is salaries and employee benefits  which increased by in this increase is primarily the result of the inclusion of minotola operations since april   normal annual salary increases  and higher benefit costs 
in addition  million was recorded as share based compensation expense as a result of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  fas no 
r on january  on december   our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting  effective as of december   of all unvested stock options granted to employees and directors in and the decision to accelerate the vesting of these options primarily was made to reduce non cash compensation expense that would have been recorded in our income statement in future periods as a result of the adoption of fas no 
r 
we estimate that  as a result of this action  approximately million of compensation expense was eliminated in  approximately million of compensation expense will have been eliminated in  and approximately million of compensation expense will have been eliminated in as a result of the accelerated vesting of these options  compensation expense totaling million was included in our results of operations for occupancy and furniture and equipment 
the increase can be attributed to the inclusion of minotola operations since april  vehicle residual value 
the decrease is the result of the contractual decrease in residual value guarantee premiums for for further information  refer to the discussion concerning vehicle leasing residual value risk on page of this form k 
other expense 
all other expenses increased see table 
the inclusion of minotola operations since april  contributed to a general increase in all expense categories 

table of contents table analysis of other expenses year ended december  dollars in thousands advertising  marketing  and public relations fdic and other insurance legal and consulting postage and delivery all other total income taxes our effective tax rates for and  were and  respectively 
the increase in our effective tax rate for was the result of a release of our valuation allowance  in  relating to our assessment that all of our state net operating losses were realizable 
financial condition summary of compared to total assets at december   were billion  an increase of  as compared to total assets of billion at december  the fair value of assets acquired in the minotola transaction was million

securities identified as available for sale must be reported at their market or fair value  and the difference between that value and their amortized cost is recorded in the equity section  net of taxes  as a component of other comprehensive income 
accordingly  as a result of changes in the interest rate environment and the impairment loss discussed in the following paragraph  our total equity was positively impacted by million  as the unrealized losses  net of taxes  on available for sale securities decreased from million at december   to million at december  in december  we recognized an other than temporary impairment of million  related to our corporate investment committee s decision to implement a modest restructuring program of our federal agency debenture portfolio in this restructuring program included the january sale of federal agency debentures classified as available for sale with an aggregate book value of million and unrealized losses of million at december  we do not believe that any remaining individual security with an unrealized loss  as of december   represents an other than temporary impairment 
unrealized losses recorded for us government agencies and mortgage backed securities are attributable to changes in interest rates 
we have both the intent and the ability to hold the securities for a time necessary to recover the amortized cost 
investment securities available for sale increased million  from december   to december  this increase occurred because  as part of our investment management strategy  we purchased securities in  to replace those that will be maturing in  at interest rates that we believe will be more favorable than those that will be available in 
table of contents securities identified as trading account securities are marked to market with the change recorded in the income statement

at december   we held no securities of any one issuer other than securities of us government agencies and corporations  which  by regulation  may be excluded from this disclosure where the aggregate book value exceeded ten percent of shareholders equity 
furthermore  at december   we held one mortgage backed security with a fair value of million that was rated one category below investment grade 
the security  which was not down graded nor considered impaired  is a subordinate adjustable rate note retained in the september home equity loan securitization transaction 
there were no investment securities whose ratings were less than investment grade at december

federal home loan bank borrowings and long term debt federal home loan bank borrowings decreased million  and junior subordinated debentures increased million  from december   to december  as noted above  the decrease in fhlb borrowings occurred because we replaced some of this debt with short term borrowings 
on april   we completed a private placement to an institutional investor of million of fixed floating rate trust preferred securities through a newly formed delaware trust affiliate  susquehanna tp trust 
table of contents the trust 
the trust preferred securities mature in june  are redeemable at our option beginning after five years  and bear interest initially at a rate of per annum through the interest payment date in june and  after the interest payment date in june  at a rate per annum equal to the three month libor plus 
the proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities were used by the trust to purchase our fixed floating rate junior subordinated notes 
the net proceeds to us from the sale of the notes to the trust were used to finance our acquisition of minotola national bank 
the notes were issued pursuant to a junior subordinated indenture  dated april   between us  as issuer  and the trustee 
like the trust preferred securities  the notes bear interest initially at a rate of per annum through the interest payment date in june and  after the interest payment date in june  at a rate per annum equal to the three month libor plus 
our interest payments will be used to pay the quarterly distributions payable by the trust to the holder of the trust preferred securities 
however  so long as no event of default  as described below  has occurred under the notes  we may defer interest payments on the notes in which case the trust will be entitled to defer distributions otherwise due on the trust preferred securities for up to twenty quarters 
the notes are subordinated to the prior payments of any of our other indebtedness that  by its terms  is not similarly subordinated 
the trust preferred securities have been recorded as a long term liability on our balance sheet  however  for regulatory purposes the trust preferred securities will be treated as tier capital under rulings of the federal reserve board  our primary federal regulatory agency 
the notes mature on june   but may be redeemed at our option at any time on or after june   or at any time upon certain events  such as a change in the regulatory capital treatment of the notes  the trust being deemed an investment company or the occurrence of certain adverse tax events 
except upon the occurrence of certain events described above  we may redeem the notes at their aggregate principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
if the notes are redeemed in connection with the certain events described above  and if the redemption occurs before the interest payment date in june  the redemption price will be the greater of of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest including additional interest on the notes to the redemption date  or as determined by the quotation agent  the sum of the present values of the scheduled payments of principal and interest on the notes during the fixed rate period remaining life of the notes assuming the notes matured on the interest payment date in june discounted to the redemption date on a quarterly basis at the treasury rate  plus accrued and unpaid interest including additional interest on the notes to such redemption date  or if the redemption date occurs on or after the interest payment date in june  of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed  plus accrued and unpaid interest including any additional interest on such notes to the redemption date 
the notes may be declared immediately due and payable at the election of the trustee or holders of of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes upon the occurrence of any event of default 
an event of default generally means a default in the payment of any interest following our deferral of interest payments by twenty consecutive quarters  a default in the payment of the principal amount of the notes at maturity  a default in our performance  or breach  of any covenant or warranty in the indenture which is not cured within sixty days  the institution of any bankruptcy or similar proceedings by or against us or the liquidation or winding up of the trust  other than as contemplated in the indenture 
we also have entered into a guarantee agreement  dated april   pursuant to which we have agreed to guarantee the payment by the trust of distributions of the trust preferred securities  and the payment of principal of the trust preferred securities when due  either at maturity or on redemption  but only if and to the extent that the trust fails to pay distributions on or principal of the trust preferred securities after having received interest payments or principal payments on the note from us for the purpose of paying those distributions or the principal amount of the trust preferred securities 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments table presents certain of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  including susquehanna s guarantees on behalf of its subsidiaries  and their expected year of payment or expiration

assets and certain off balance sheet items are segmented into one of four broad risk categories and weighted according to the relative percentage of credit risk assigned by the regulatory authorities 
off balance sheet instruments are converted into a balance sheet credit equivalent before being assigned to one of the four risk weighted categories 
to supplement the risk based capital ratios  the regulators issued a minimum leverage ratio guideline tier capital as a percentage of average assets less excludable intangibles 
capital elements are segmented into two tiers 
tier capital represents shareholders equity plus junior subordinated debentures reduced by excludable intangibles 
tier capital represents certain allowable long term debt  the portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses equal to of risk adjusted assets  and of the unrealized gain on equity securities 
the sum of tier capital and tier capital is total risk based capital 
the maintenance of a strong capital base at both the parent company level as well as at each bank affiliate is an important aspect of our philosophy 
we  and each of our bank subsidiaries  have leverage and risk weighted ratios well in excess of regulatory minimums  and each entity is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
market risks the types of market risk exposures generally faced by banking entities include equity market price risk  liquidity risk  
table of contents interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  and commodity price risk 
due to the nature of our operations  foreign currency and commodity price risk are not significant to us 
however  in addition to general banking risks  we have other risks that are related to vehicle leasing  asset securitizations  and off balance sheet financing that are also discussed below 
equity market price risk equity market price risk is the risk related to market fluctuations of equity prices in the securities markets 
while we do not have significant risk in our investment portfolio  market price fluctuations may affect fee income generated through our asset management operations 
generally  our fee structure is based on the market value of assets being managed at specific time frames 
if market values decline  our fee income may also decline 
liquidity risk the maintenance of adequate liquidity the ability to meet the cash requirements of our customers and other financial commitments is a fundamental aspect of our asset liability management strategy 
our policy of diversifying our funding sources purchased funds  repurchase agreements  and deposit accounts allows us to avoid undue concentration in any single financial market and also to avoid heavy funding requirements within short periods of time 
at december   our bank subsidiaries had approximately million available to them under collateralized lines of credit with various fhlbs  and million more was available provided that additional collateral had been pledged 
liquidity is not entirely dependent on increasing our liability balances 
liquidity is also evaluated by taking into consideration maturing or readily marketable assets 
unrestricted short term investments amounted to million for the year ended december   and represented additional sources of liquidity 
as an additional source of liquidity  we periodically enter into securitization transactions in which we sell the beneficial interests in loans and leases and related vehicles to qualified special purpose entities qspes 
in march  we entered into a term securitization transaction of leases and related vehicles 
the purchase of these assets by the qspes was financed through the issuance of asset backed notes to third party investors 
net proceeds from this transaction totaled million 
in september  we entered into a term securitization transaction of fixed and variable rate home mortgage loans 
net proceeds from this transaction totaled million 
during  net proceeds from securitization transactions totaled million 
interest rate risk the management of interest rate risk focuses on controlling the risk to net interest income and the associated net interest margin as the result of changing market rates and spreads 
interest rate sensitivity is the matching or mismatching of the repricing and rate structure of the interest bearing assets and liabilities 
our goal is to control risk exposure to changing rates within management s accepted guidelines to maintain an acceptable level of risk exposure in support of consistent earnings 
we employ a variety of methods to monitor interest rate risk 
these methods include basic gap analysis  which points to directional exposure  routine rate shocks simulation  and evaluation of the change in economic value of equity 
board directed guidelines have been adopted for both the rate shock simulations and economic value of equity exposure limits 
by dividing the assets and liabilities into three groups  fixed rate  floating rate and those which reprice only at our discretion  strategies are developed to control the exposure to interest rate fluctuations 

table of contents our interest rate risk using the static gap analysis is presented in table this method reports the difference between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at a specific point in time 
management uses the static gap methodology to identify our directional interest rate risk 
table also illustrates our estimated interest rate sensitivity periodic and cumulative gap positions as calculated as of december   and these estimates include anticipated prepayments on commercial and residential loans  and mortgage backed securities  in addition to certain repricing assumptions relative to our core deposits 
traditionally  an institution with more assets repricing than liabilities over a given time frame is considered asset sensitive  and one with more liabilities repricing than assets is considered liability sensitive 
an asset sensitive institution will generally benefit from rising rates  and a liability sensitive institution will generally benefit from declining rates 
static gap analysis is widely accepted because of its simplicity in identifying interest rate risk exposure  but it ignores market spread adjustments  the changing mix of the balance sheet  planned balance sheet management strategies  and the change in prepayment assumptions

table of contents in addition to static gap reports comparing the sensitivity of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in interest rates  we also utilize simulation analysis that measures our exposure to interest rate risk 
the financial simulation model calculates the income effect and the economic value of assets  liabilities and equity at current and forecasted interest rates  and at hypothetical higher and lower interest rates at one percent intervals 
the income effect and economic value of defined categories of financial instruments is calculated by the model using estimated cash flows based on embedded options  prepayments  early withdrawals  and weighted average contractual rates and terms 
for economic value calculations  the model also considers discount rates for similar financial instruments 
the economic values of longer term fixed rate financial instruments are generally more sensitive to changes in interest rates 
adjustable rate and variable rate financial instruments largely reflect only a change in economic value representing the difference between the contractual and discounted rates until the next contractual interest rate repricing date  unless subject to rate caps and floors 
a portion of our loan portfolio consists of commercial and residential mortgage loans containing embedded options  which permit the borrower to repay the principal balance of the loan prior to maturity prepayments without penalty 
a loan s susceptibility for prepayment is dependent upon a number of factors  including the current interest rate versus the contractual interest rate of the loan  the financial ability of the borrower to refinance  the economic benefit and the availability of refinancing at attractive terms in addition to general changes in customers needs 
refinancing may also depend upon economic and other factors in specific geographic areas that affect the sales and price levels of residential property 
in a changing interest rate environment  prepayments may increase or decrease depending on the current relative levels and expectations of future short term and long term interest rates 
changes in market rates and general economic conditions will have an impact on an organization s mortgage backed security portfolio 
this will have an associated change on our sensitivity position in changing economic times 
savings and checking deposits generally may be withdrawn upon the customer s request without prior notice 
a continuing relationship with customers resulting in future deposits and withdrawals is generally predictable  resulting in a dependable source of funds 
time deposits generally have early withdrawal penalties  while term fhlb borrowings and subordinated notes have prepayment penalties  which discourage customer withdrawal of time deposits and prepayment of fhlb borrowings and subordinated notes prior to maturity 
our floating rate loan portfolio is primarily indexed to national interest rate indices 
the portfolio is funded by interest bearing liabilities which are determined by other indices  primarily deposits and fhlb borrowings 
a changing interest rate environment may result in different levels of changes to the different indices resulting in disproportionate changes in the value of  and the net earnings generated from such financial instruments 
basis risk is the result of this inconsistent change in the indices  with historical relationships not always being a good indicator 
tables and reflect the estimated income effect and economic value of assets  liabilities  and equity calculated using certain assumptions we determined as of december   and  at then current interest rates and at hypothetical higher and lower interest rates in and increments 
as noted in table  the economic value of equity at risk as of december   is  at an interest rate change of positive  while table discloses that net interest income at risk as of december   is  at an interest rate change of positive

our risk management objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest income and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks 
to accomplish this objective  we primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our hedging strategy 
during  such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable rate debt and a forecasted auto lease securitization 
the derivatives were designated as cash flow hedges 
we assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction 
at december   no derivatives were designated as fair valued hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations 
additionally  we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and other identified risks  but do no meet the strict hedge accounting requirements of fas no

auto lenders  which was formed in  is a used vehicle remarketer with four retail locations in new jersey and has access to various wholesale facilities throughout the country 
under these arrangements  auto lenders agrees to purchase the beneficial interest in all vehicles returned by the obligors at the scheduled expiration of the related leases for a purchase price equal to the stated residual value of such vehicles 
stated residual values of new leases are set in accordance with the standards approved in advance by auto lenders 
under a servicing agreement with auto lenders  hann also agrees to make monthly guaranty payments to auto lenders based upon a negotiated schedule covering a three year period 
at the end of each year  the servicing agreement may be renewed by the mutual agreement of the parties for an additional one year term  beyond the current three year term  subject to renegotiation of the payments for the additional year 
during the renewal process  we periodically obtain competitive quotes from third parties to determine the best remarketing and or residual guarantee alternatives for hann and our bank affiliates

fas no 
 and a net gain or loss is recognized at the time of the initial sale 
the qspes then issue beneficial interests in the form of senior and subordinated asset backed securities backed or collateralized by the assets sold to the qspes 
the senior classes of the asset basked securities typically receive investment grade credit ratings at the time of issuance 
these ratings are generally achieved through the creation of lower rated subordinated classes of asset backed securities  as well as subordinated interests retained by susquehanna 
excess cash flows represent the cash flows from the underlying assets less distributions of cash flows to beneficial interest holders in accordance with the distribution priority requirements of the transaction 
we  as servicer  distribute to third party beneficial interest holders contracted returns 
we retain the right to remaining cash flows after distributions to these third party beneficial interest holders 
the cash flows are discounted to present value and recorded as interest only strips 
the resulting interest only strips are subordinate to the rights of each of the third party beneficial interest holders 
we estimate the fair value of these interest only strips based on the present value of future expected cash flows  using management s estimate of the key assumptions regarding credit losses  prepayment speeds  and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved at the time assets are sold to the applicable qspe and adjusted quarterly based on changes in these key economic risk factors 
based upon the information found in the table in footnote  securitization activity  we believe that any adverse change of in the key economic assumptions would not have a significant effect on the fair value of our interest only strips 
in order to facilitate lease securitizations and other off balance sheet financings  hann formed hann auto trust  a delaware statutory trust the origination trust  on september   pursuant to a trust agreement between hann  as settlor and initial beneficiary  and a third party trustee 
the primary business purpose of the origination trust is to enter into lease contracts with respect to automobiles  sport utility vehicles  light duty trucks  and other vehicles and to serve as record holder of title to such leased vehicles 
unlike ordinary accounts receivable or lease paper  a motor vehicle can only be transferred if the transferor signs the back of the certificate of title and certifies the odometer reading  and the transferee applies for a new certificate of title in its own name 
with the use of an origination or titling trust like the origination trust  a party may hold a beneficial interest in 
table of contents a lease and the related vehicle including the related cash flows  but because legal ownership of the vehicle remains with the trust  the vehicle need not be retitled 
the origination trust was created to avoid the administrative difficulty and expense associated with retitling leased vehicles in a securitization  sale leaseback  or other financing of automobile and truck leases and the related vehicles 
upon formation  the origination trust issued to hann the undivided trust interest representing the entire beneficial interest in the unallocated assets of the origination trust 
hann purchases vehicles and related leases directly from motor vehicle dealers 
the motor vehicle dealers title these vehicles in the name of the origination trust at the time of the purchase 
hann initially owns the beneficial interest in all leases and related vehicles 
under the trust agreement for the origination trust  hann may instruct the trustees of the trust to establish a special unit of beneficial interest in the origination trust commonly referred to as a subi and to allocate a separate portfolio of leases and the related vehicles leased under the leases to that subi 
the subi will evidence an indirect beneficial interest  rather than a direct legal interest  in the assets allocated thereto 
under the terms of the trust agreement and the delaware statutory trust act  the holder of a subi will have no interest in the assets allocated to the undivided trust interest or to any other subi  and the holder of the undivided trust interest will have no interest in the assets allocated to any subi 
hann creates and transfers beneficial interests in the origination trust that represent the rights in pools of leases and related vehicles included in securitization  sale leaseback  agency  and other transactions 
the beneficial interests in the origination trust represented by a subi have only been used for securitizations  sale leasebacks  agency transactions  and as a method of permitting affiliates of hann to hold the beneficial interest in a pool of leases and related vehicles 
there are no other transactions using a subi in the origination trust 
the leases  for accounting purposes  are treated as direct financing receivables as a result of a residual purchase agreement with auto lenders 
although we have not retained residual value risk in the automobile leases and related vehicles  in the event of a breach by auto lenders  a qspe may suffer residual losses  which we expect would decrease the value of the interest only strips recognized by us 
summary of securitization transactions home equity loan 
in september  one of our banking subsidiaries  susquehanna bank pa  entered into a term securitization transaction of fixed rate home mortgage loans and adjustable rate helocs the september transaction 
some of the loans sold were originated by two of our other banking subsidiaries  susquehanna bank and susquehanna patriot bank  and sold to susquehanna bank pa immediately prior to the closing of the securitization 
in connection with the september transaction  susquehanna bank pa sold a portfolio of fixed rate home equity loans with an aggregate principal balance of approximately million and a portfolio of adjustable rate helocs with an aggregate principal balance of approximately million to a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary the transferor 
in the transaction documents for the september transaction  susquehanna bank pa provides  among other things  representations and warranties with respect to the home equity loans transferred 
in the event that any such representations and warranties were materially untrue with respect to any assets when transferred  the affected loans must be repurchased by susquehanna bank pa 
we provide a guaranty of such repurchase obligation 
the transferor sold the portfolio acquired from susquehanna bank pa to a newly formed statutory trust the issuer 
the equity interests of the issuer other than a non economic interest representing tax ownership of the securitized fixed rate home equity loan portfolio are owned by the transferor 
the transferor financed the purchase of the portfolio of home equity loans from susquehanna bank pa primarily through the issuance by the issuer of million of floating rate asset backed notes to third party investors 
in connection with the securitization  susquehanna retained servicing responsibilities for the loans 

table of contents a portion of the helocs  which generally accrue interest at a variable rate  include a feature that permits the obligor to convert all or a portion of the loan from a variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate 
the maximum dollar amount of the portfolio balances sold in the september transaction that is subject to this conversion feature was million at the transaction cut off date 
during the draw period  the obligor may request that susquehanna establish fixed rate repayment terms for an amount not to exceed the then outstanding balance under the credit line 
requests must be for amounts which do not exceed the credit limit  and no event of default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of the request 
we complete all required underwriting at the time of origination  and no additional underwriting occurs at the time the obligor exercises the fixed rate conversion feature 
the credit limit will include credit advances under the credit line and outstanding balances under the previously requested fixed rate repayments 
the minimum fixed rate repayment request is three thousand dollars 
the obligor may elect to submit fixed rate repayment requests at any time during the draw period 
the obligor is limited to three fixed rate repayment schedules at any time 
the reason for permitting the conversion feature is to be competitive in our marketplace  as many other financial institutions offer this feature 
in the september transaction  one class of the issuer s floating rate asset backed notes was backed by variable rate helocs 
however  approximately of the helocs as of the cut off date for the transaction included a feature that permits the obligor to convert all or a portion of the outstanding balance from a variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate 
if a significant portion of obligors elected to fix the rate of interest on their mortgage loans  then the issuer might have insufficient funds to make payments on the floating rate notes backed by the helocs as rates increase beyond the rate of the fixed rate loans 
to mitigate the effect of this remote risk  the external parties involved in structuring the september transaction and susquehanna worked together to formulate a solution acceptable to the parties 
the parties determined that the issuer s ability to make interest payments on the class of floating rate notes backed by the helocs was unlikely to be materially and adversely affected if the issuer s portfolio of helocs included up to fixed rate loans 
after that threshold was exceeded  however  susquehanna bank pa would be required to repurchase loans with converted balances in an amount not to exceed of the original principal balance of the helocs  which is approximately million 
under the transaction agreements  susquehanna bank pa is neither required nor permitted to repurchase more than of the original principal balance of the converted loans 
however  because up to of the helocs could be held by the issuer as fixed rate loans in excess of the threshold acceptable to the parties  the issuer entered into an interest rate protection agreement with susquehanna  structured in accordance with fas no 
 paragraph  to protect the third party beneficial interest holders above the threshold 
the interest rate protection agreement counterparty is susquehanna  and the agreement provides the issuer with an additional source of funds to make payments on the floating rate notes if the floating rate exceeds the fixed rates of the loans for which the related obligors have exercised their fixed rate conversion feature 
based on our historical experience with helocs with the conversion feature  we determined that it was highly unlikely that more than of the helocs held by the issuer would be converted by the related obligors from variable rate to fixed rate obligations 
this conclusion is based in part on our experience with helocs that have conversion features  which tend to be converted by obligors from variable rate to fixed rate within the first three to six months after origination 
the securitized pool  at the time the loans were transferred to the issuer  was generally seasoned more than six months 
further  we determined that it is highly unlikely that we will have any liability under the interest rate protection agreement provided for in the transaction agreements because we believe that  based upon historical experience and business understanding of obligor behavior  less than of the helocs will be converted by the related obligors to fixed rate loans 
the estimated maximum cost and fair value to susquehanna of complying with the interest rate protection discussed above is considered de minimus 
this transaction was accounted for as a sale under fas no 
for additional information concerning the initial valuation of retained interests  please see the footnote to the financial statements entitled securitization activity 
the gain recognized in this transaction was million 
the initial interest only strips recorded for this transaction were million  and the fair value of these interest only strips at december   was million

the reason for permitting the conversion feature is to be competitive in our marketplace as many other financial institutions offer this feature  and the maximum dollar amount of the portfolio balances sold which is subject to this conversion feature was million at the transaction cut off date 
under the transaction documents for the heloc transaction  if the aggregate principal balance of loans converted to fixed rate loans exceeds of the outstanding aggregate principal balance of the portfolio  then susquehanna bank pa is required to repurchase converted loans in excess of this threshold until the aggregate principal balance of loans repurchased by susquehanna bank pa for this reason is equal to of the original principal balance of the loans 
if  after giving effect to any repurchase by susquehanna bank pa of loans with converted balances  the aggregate principal balance of fixed interest rate loans exceeds of the aggregate principal balance of the portfolio  then an interest rate protection agreement between the issuer and susquehanna becomes operative 
under the interest rate protection agreement  the issuer will be obligated to make fixed payments  which will be based on the fixed rates of the converted mortgage loans  and we will be obligated to make floating payments  which will be based on the indices of the variable rate mortgage loans 
we do not expect to repurchase any converted loans nor enter into any interest rate protection agreements 
in this transaction  the issuer issued floating rate asset backed notes to third party investors  which were backed by variable rate helocs 
however  approximately of the loans as of the cut off date for the transaction included a feature that permits the obligor to convert all or a portion of the outstanding balance from a variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate 
if a significant portion of obligors elected to fix the rate of interest on their mortgage loans  then the issuer might have insufficient funds to make payments on the floating rate notes as rates increase beyond the rate of the fixed rate loans 
to mitigate the effect of this remote risk  the external parties involved in structuring the heloc transaction and susquehanna worked together to formulate a solution acceptable to the parties 
the parties determined that the issuer s ability to make interest payments on the floating rate notes was unlikely to be materially and adversely affected if the issuer s assets included up to fixed rate loans 
after that threshold was exceeded  however  susquehanna bank pa would be required to repurchase loans with converted balances in an amount not to exceed of the original principal balance of the helocs  which is approximately million 
under the transaction agreements  susquehanna bank pa is neither required nor permitted to repurchase more than of the original principal balance of the converted loans 
however  because up to of loans could be held by the issuer as fixed rate loans in excess of the threshold acceptable to the parties  the issuer entered into an interest rate protection agreement with us  structured in accordance with fas no 
 paragraph  to protect the third party beneficial interest holders  above the threshold 
the interest rate protection agreement counterparty is susquehanna  and the agreement provides the issuer with an additional source of funds to make payments on the floating rate notes if the floating rate exceeds the fixed rates of the loans for which the related obligors have exercised their fixed rate conversion feature 
our estimated maximum cost of complying with the interest rate protection is considered de minimus 
based on our historical experience with helocs with the conversion feature  we determined that it was highly unlikely that more than of the helocs held by the issuer would be converted by the related obligors from variable rate to fixed rate obligations 
this conclusion is based in part on our experience with helocs that have conversion features  which tend to be converted by obligors from variable rate to fixed rate within the first three to six months after origination 
the securitized pool  at the time the loans were transferred to the issuer  was generally seasoned more than six months

these notes  which do not bear interest  have been rated by independent rating agencies and have a final maturity date of february  we have retained the notes because the interest rate required to sell them was too high in comparison to the associated risk

the lessor held the beneficial interest in vehicles and auto leases with a remaining balance of approximately million at december  to support its obligations under the master lease agreement  at closing the lessee pledged the beneficial interest in an additional million of automobile leases and related vehicles  which were also sold or contributed to the lessee 
at december   the beneficial interest in additional automobile leases and related vehicles pledged by the lessee was million 
under the master lease agreement  the lessee has an early buyout option which could be exercised on january  the ebo date under which the lessee can repurchase all  but not less than all  of the beneficial interests in leases and related vehicles 
if the option is exercised  the lessee will pay to the lessor the purchase price under the early buyout option the ebo price

the lessee must also pay the out of pocket costs and expenses including all transfer taxes and legal fees and expenses incurred by the lessor  the trustees and their affiliates in connection with such purchase

hann has not recorded servicing assets nor liabilities with regard to those transactions because its expected servicing costs are approximately equal to its expected servicing income 

table of contents the parent company acts as servicer for securitized home equity loans and recorded aggregate servicing assets based on the present value of estimated future net servicing income 
the fair value of these assets was million at december  capitalized servicing rights are reported in other assets and are amortized into noninterest income in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets 
overall however  we enter into securitization transactions primarily to achieve low cost funding for the growth of our loan and lease portfolio and to manage capital  and not primarily to maximize our ongoing servicing fee revenue 
in the future  in regard to lease securitizations  if servicing costs were to exceed servicing income  we would record the present value of that liability as an expense 
our policy regarding the impairment of servicing assets is to evaluate the assets based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost 
fair value is based upon discounted cash flows using market based assumptions 
impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance to the extent that fair value is less than the capitalized amount

table of contents in september  the securities and exchange commission published staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab was issued to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
traditionally  there have been two widely recognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements the roll over method and the iron curtain method 
the roll over method focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement  including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements  but its use can lead to the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet 
the iron curtain method focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year error on the income statement 
in the past  susquehanna has used the iron curtain method 
in sab  the sec staff established a model  commonly referred to as a dual approach  that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of a company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
sab permits public companies to initially apply its provisions either by restating prior financial statements as if the dual approach had always been used or recording the cumulative effect of initially applying the dual approach as adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of january   with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
as susquehanna has always used the iron curtain method  applying the provisions of sab does not result in either restating prior financial statements or recording a cumulative adjustment
