item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are a global consumer foods company 
we develop distinctive food products and market these value added products under unique brand names 
we work continuously on product innovation to improve our established brands and to create new products that meet consumers evolving needs and preferences 
in addition  we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer directed marketing and innovative merchandising 
we believe our brand building strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe 
our fundamental business goal is to generate superior returns for our stockholders over the long term 
we believe that increases in net sales  segment operating profits  earnings per share  and return on average total capital are the key measures of financial performance for our businesses 
see page for our discussion of segment operating profit and return on average total capital  which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
our objectives are to consistently deliver low single digit average annual growth in net sales  mid single digit average annual growth in total segment operating profit  high single digit average annual growth in earnings per share eps  and at least a basis point average annual increase in return on average total capital 
we believe that this financial performance  coupled with an attractive dividend yield  should result in long term value creation for stockholders 
we also return a substantial amount of cash annually to stockholders through share repurchases 
for the fiscal year ended may   our net sales grew percent  total segment operating profit grew percent  diluted eps increased percent  and our return on average total capital improved by basis points 
these results met or exceeded our long term targets 
net cash provided by operations totaled nearly billion in fiscal  enabling us to increase our annual dividend payments per share by percent from fiscal and continue returning cash to stockholders through share repurchases  which totaled  million in fiscal we made significant capital investments totaling million to support future growth and productivity 
we achieved each of our four key operating objectives for fiscal we generated net sales growth across our businesses 
both big g cereals and pillsbury usa renewed net sales growth in fiscal following modest sales declines in fiscal in addition  all of our other us retail divisions and our international and bakeries and foodservice segments each posted net sales gains in fiscal we achieved net sales contributions from new products  as we introduced more than new food items in markets around the world 
we capitalized on growth opportunities for our brands in new channels and international markets 
during  we increased our unit volume and net sales in fast growing retail channels such as drug  dollar and discount stores  convenience stores  and supercenters 
outside the united states  international segment net sales increased percent in fiscal and exceeded billion for the first time 
we also recorded increases in both gross margin and segment operating profit in fiscal  despite continued input cost inflation and a significant increase in our consumer marketing spending 
details of our financial results are provided in the fiscal consolidated results of operations section below 
our fiscal operating objectives are consistent with our long term growth model and are built around broad based growth in net sales  focused cost savings initiatives to offset higher input costs  and increased levels of investment in media and other brand building marketing programs to fuel continued net sales growth 
to drive growth in net sales  we plan to increase unit volumes  improve sales mix  and achieve net price realization through a combination of pricing actions and trade promotion efficiencies 
we also will continue to focus on faster growing retail formats and foodservice channels such as membership and convenience stores  and expand our branded product sales to hospitality and healthcare related foodservice customers with new products and portion sizes 
internationally  we are focused on building our global brands 
our company wide cost saving initiatives include evaluating sales mix and trade spending efficiency  portfolio management techniques including product rationalization and simplification  capital investments in manufacturing technology  and global sourcing 
we expect pricing and cost savings initiatives to help us largely offset significant input cost inflation  especially for dairy ingredients  oils primarily soybean  and grains 
our plans also call for reinvestment of some of these cost savings in 
table of contents media and other brand building marketing programs  resulting in another high single digit increase in these expenditures 
our plans also call for million of expenditures for capital projects  and a significant amount of cash returned to stockholders 
we intend to continue repurchasing shares in fiscal  with a goal of reducing average diluted shares outstanding a net percent 
on june   our board of directors approved a dividend increase to an annual rate of per share 
this represents a percent compound annual growth rate in dividends from fiscal to fiscal application of hedge accounting under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas  requires significant resources  recordkeeping  and analytical systems 
as a result of the rising compliance costs and the complexity associated with the application of hedge accounting  we have elected to discontinue the use of hedge accounting for our commodity derivatives at the beginning of fiscal for all new commodity derivatives entered into after that date 
accordingly  the changes in the values of these derivatives will be recorded in earnings currently  resulting in volatility in both net earnings and gross margin 
these gains and losses will be reported in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings and in unallocated corporate expenses in our segment operating results 
regardless of designation for accounting purposes  we believe all our commodity hedges are economic hedges of our risk exposures 
commodity derivatives previously accounted for as cash flow hedges are not affected by this change and any gains or losses deferred to accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity will remain there until the hedged item affects earnings

fiscal consolidated balance sheet analysis as of may   we adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas 
sfas requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which is a component of stockholders equity

impact of inflation we believe that changes in the general rate of inflation have not had a significant effect on profitability over the three most recent fiscal years other than as noted above related to ingredients  packaging  energy  and employee benefit costs 
we attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through appropriate planning and operating practices 
our risk management practices are discussed in item a on pages through of this report 
liquidity the primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations 
over the most recent three year period  our operations have generated billion in cash 
a substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to stockholders annually through share repurchases and dividends 
we also use this source of liquidity to fund our annual capital expenditures 
we typically use a combination of available cash  notes payable  and long term debt to finance acquisitions and major capital expansions

changes in working capital were a reduced source of cash flow from operations in fiscal versus fiscal primarily reflecting a million decrease in cash flows from accounts receivable  and a million reduction in the source of cash from other current liabilities  primarily from a smaller increase in accrued taxes in fiscal than in fiscal a key measure that we manage is the growth rate in core working capital

we believe that growth in return on average total capital is a key performance measure 
return on average total capital increased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal due to earnings growth and disciplined use of cash 
we also believe important measures of financial strength are the ratio of fixed charge coverage and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt 
our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal was compared to in fiscal the measure declined from fiscal as a million increase in earnings before income taxes and after tax earnings from joint ventures was more than offset by the impact of a million decrease in distributions of earnings from joint ventures and a million increase in fixed charges 
our operating cash flow to debt ratio decreased to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal  as cash flows from operations declined slightly from fiscal and year end debt balances increased slightly over the same period

in june  we sold an additional  class a preferred membership interests in gmc to the same 
table of contents unrelated third party investor in exchange for million 
in october  we sold  series b preferred membership interests in gmc to an unrelated third party investor in exchange for million 
the terms of the series b and class a interests held by the third party investors and the rights of those investors are detailed in the third amended and restated limited liability company agreement of gmc the llc agreement 
currently  we hold all interests in gmc including all managing member interests  other than the class a interests and the series b interests 
the class a interests receive quarterly preferred distributions based on their capital account balance at a floating rate equal to the sum of three month libor plus basis points 
the rate of the distributions on the class a interests must be adjusted by agreement between the class a interest holder and gmc  or through a remarketing  every five years 
the first adjustment of the rate occurred in june and the next adjustment is scheduled to occur in july gmc  through its managing member  may elect to repurchase all of the class a interests at any time for an amount equal to the holder s capital account  plus any unpaid preferred returns and any applicable make whole amount 
upon a failed remarketing  the rate over libor will be increased by basis points until the next scheduled remarketing  which will occur in month intervals until a successful remarketing 
as of may   the capital account balance of the class a interests held by the unrelated third party was million  and it was million as of june   reflecting the third party s purchase of million of additional class a interests and a million increase in the capital account balance associated with the previously owned interests 
the series b interests of gmc are entitled to receive quarterly preferred distributions based on their capital account balance at a fixed rate of percent per year  which is scheduled to be reset to a new fixed rate through a remarketing in august the capital account balance of the series b interests was million as of may   and will be increased to million in august in connection with the remarketing

if we do not conduct a remarketing or repurchase the interests  the preferred distribution rate will be reset to a floating rate 
as the managing member of gmc  we may elect to repurchase the series b interests for an amount equal to the holder s then current capital account balance i in august and in five year intervals thereafter  and ii on any distribution date during a period in which the preferred return is set at a floating rate 
the holders of the series b interests cannot require us to repurchase the interests 
the series b interests will be exchanged for shares of our perpetual preferred stock as a result of our senior unsecured debt rating falling below either ba as rated by moody s or bb as rated by s p or fitch  our bankruptcy or liquidation  a default on any of our senior indebtedness resulting in an acceleration of indebtedness having an outstanding principal balance in excess of million  failing to pay a dividend on our common stock in any fiscal quarter  or certain liquidating events described in the llc agreement

on august   the pension protection act ppa became law in the united states 
the ppa revised the basis and methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits paid from tax qualified plans 
most of these provisions are first applicable to our domestic defined benefit pension plans in fiscal on a phased in basis 
the ppa may ultimately require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans 
however  due to our historical funding practices and current funded status  we do not expect to have significant statutory or contractual funding requirements for our major defined benefit plans during the next several years 
no domestic plan contributions are currently expected 
actual contributions could exceed our current projections  and may be influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities  or by future changes in government requirements 
additionally  our projections concerning timing of the ppa funding requirements are subject to change and may be influenced by factors such as general market conditions affecting trust asset performance  interest rates and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa

the fair value of our interest rate and equity swaps was a payable of million as of may   based on fair market values as of that date 
future changes in market values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those instruments in the future 
other long term obligations 
table of contents primarily consist of liabilities for uncertain income tax positions  accrued compensation and benefits  including the underfunded status of certain of our defined benefit pension  other postretirement benefit  and postemployment benefit plans  and miscellaneous liabilities 
we expect to pay million of benefits from our unfunded postemployment benefit plans in fiscal further information on all of these plans is included in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing on pages through in item of this report 
significant accounting estimates for a complete description of our significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing on pages through in item of this report 
our significant accounting estimates are those that have meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies include our accounting for promotional expenditures  intangible assets  stock compensation  income taxes  and defined benefit pension  other postretirement and postemployment benefits 
promotional expenditures our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers 
these activities include payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf  such as advertising or in store displays  discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices and payments to gain distribution of new products  coupons  contests  and other incentives  and media and advertising expenditures 
the media and advertising expenditures are recognized as expense when the advertisement airs 
the cost of payments to customers and other consumer activities are recognized as the related revenue is recorded  which generally precedes the actual cash expenditure 
the recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels 
these estimates are made based on the forecasted customer sales  the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities  and other factors 
differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period 
our accrued trade  coupon  and brand building consumer marketing liabilities were million as of may   and million as of may  because our total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues are significant  if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments that could have a material effect on our results of operations 
our unit volume in the last week of a quarter can be higher than the average for the preceding weeks of the quarter in certain circumstances 
in comparison to the average daily shipments in the first weeks of a quarter  the final week of each quarter may have as much as two to four days worth of incremental shipments based on a five day week  reflecting increased promotional activity at the end of the quarter 
this increased activity includes promotions to assure that our customers have sufficient inventory on hand to support major marketing events or increased seasonal demand early in the next quarter  as well as promotions intended to help achieve interim unit volume targets 
if  due to quarter end promotions or other reasons  our customers purchase more product in any reporting period than end consumer demand will require in future periods  our sales level in future reporting periods could be adversely affected 
intangible assets goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired 
goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units 
we compare the carrying value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  to the fair value of the unit 
carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit  which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we revalue all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  excluding goodwill  to determine if the fair value of the net assets is greater than the net assets including goodwill 
if the fair value of the net assets is less than the net assets including goodwill  impairment has occurred 
our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model 
growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual long range planning process 
we also make estimates of discount rates  perpetuity growth assumptions  market comparables  and other factors 
we periodically engage third party valuation consultants to assist in this process 
during fiscal  we changed the timing of our annual goodwill impairment testing from the first day of our fiscal year to december this accounting change is preferable because it better aligns this impairment test with the timing of the presentation of our strategic long range plan to the board of directors 
during fiscal  we performed this annual impairment test on may   and again on december  the fair values for all of our reporting units exceed their carrying values by at least percent 
we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets  primarily intangible assets associated with the pillsbury  totino s  progresso  green giant  old el paso and h agen dazs brands  to determine if they are finite or indefinite lived 
reaching a determination on useful life requires 
table of contents significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  other economic factors such as the stability of the industry  known technological advances  legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment  and expected changes in distribution channels  the level of required maintenance expenditures  and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 
our indefinite lived intangible assets  primarily brands  are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
we performed our fiscal assessment of our brand intangibles as of december  our estimate of the fair value of the brands was based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which included projected revenues from our annual long range plan  assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands  and a discount rate 
we periodically engage third party valuation consultants to assist in this process 
all brand intangibles had fair values in excess of their carrying values by at least percent  except for the pillsbury brand  which we estimated had a fair value less than percent higher than its carrying value 
this brand comprises nearly one half of our total indefinite lived intangible assets 
if the growth rate for the global revenue from all uses of the pillsbury brand decreases basis points from the current planned growth rate  fair value would be reduced by approximately million  assuming all other components of the fair value estimate remain unchanged 
if the assumed royalty rate for all uses of the pillsbury brand decreases by basis points  fair value would be reduced by approximately million  assuming all other components of the fair value estimate remain unchanged 
if the applicable discount rate increases by basis points  fair value of the pillsbury brand would be reduced by approximately million  assuming all other components of the fair value estimate remain unchanged 
as of may   we reviewed each of the assumptions used in the annual impairment assessment performed as of december   and found them to still be appropriate 
as of may   we had billion of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows  materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense 
stock compensation effective may   we adopted sfas r  which changed the accounting for compensation expense associated with stock options  restricted stock awards  and other forms of equity compensation 
we elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas r  accordingly  results from prior periods have not been restated 
under this method  stock based compensation expense for fiscal was million  which included amortization related to the remaining unvested portion of all equity compensation awards granted prior to may   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and amortization related to all equity compensation awards granted on or subsequent to may   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
the incremental effect on net earnings in fiscal of our adoption of sfas r was million of expense million after tax 
all our stock compensation expense is recorded in sg a expense in the consolidated statement of earnings 
prior to may   we used the intrinsic value method for measuring the cost of compensation paid in our common stock 
no compensation expense for stock options was recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings prior to fiscal  as the exercise price was equal to the market price of our stock at the date of grant 
expense attributable to other types of share based awards was recognized in our results under sfas the weighted average grant date fair values of the employee stock options granted were estimated as in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions fiscal year risk free interest rate expected term years years years expected volatility dividend yield the valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate which requires us to use significant judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements 
annually  we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility  employee exercise behavior  and dividend yield 
our methods for selecting these valuation assumptions are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements on pages through in item of this report 
for fiscal and all prior periods  our estimate of expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility determined on a daily basis over the expected term of the options 
we considered but did not use implied volatility because we believed historical volatility provided an appropriate expectation for our volatility in the future 
if all other assumptions are held constant  a one percentage point increase or decrease in our fiscal volatility assumption 
table of contents would increase or decrease the grant date fair value of our fiscal option awards by percent 
for our fiscal annual option grant made in june  we have included implied volatility in our determination of expected volatility 
we have weighted implied volatility and historical volatility equally in determining our volatility assumption 
we have included implied volatility in our determination of this assumption because exchange traded options on our stock are widely traded  and we believe the implied volatility placed on our stock by the marketplace is a reasonable indicator of expected future volatility in our stock price 
we have more heavily weighted the last several years of historical volatility data to reflect a significant decrease in both our historical and our implied volatility trends following our completion of the pillsbury acquisition in october and our operating results thereafter 
our expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model 
separate groups of employees have similar historical exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated into a single pool for valuation purposes 
the weighted average expected term for all employee groups is presented in the table above 
a change in the expected term of year  leaving all other assumptions constant  would not change the grant date fair value by more than percent 
our valuation model assumes that dividends and our share price increase in line with earnings  resulting in a constant dividend yield 
the risk free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the us treasury zero coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions  we are not required to true up grant date fair value based expense to final intrinsic values 
however  these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options  as explained in the following two paragraphs 
furthermore  historical data has a significant bearing on our forward looking assumptions 
significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions  which could then significantly impact the year over year comparability of stock based compensation expense 
sfas r also provides that any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings referred to as a windfall tax benefit is presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows as a financing rather than an operating cash flow 
if this standard had been adopted in fiscal  operating cash flow would have been lower and financing cash flow would have been higher by million as a result of this provision 
for fiscal  the windfall tax benefits classified as financing cash flow were million 
the actual impact on future years financing cash flow will depend  in part  on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes 
for balance sheet classification purposes  realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paid in capital within the consolidated balance sheet 
realized shortfall tax benefits amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits  if any  and then charged directly to income tax expense  potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate 
under the transition rules for adopting sfas r using the modified prospective method  we were permitted to calculate a cumulative amount of windfall tax benefits from post fiscal years for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits 
we completed such study prior to the first period of adoption and currently have sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls  such that we do not currently expect fiscal earnings to be affected by this provision 
however  as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control  it is possible that materially different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 
income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
management judgment is involved in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of any uncertain tax positions 
we are periodically under examination or engaged in a tax controversy 
we establish reserves in a variety of taxing jurisdictions when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable  we believe that certain positions may be challenged and may need to be revised 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
our effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to those reserves 
we also provide interest on these reserves at the appropriate statutory interest rate 
these interest charges are also included in our effective tax rate 
as of may   our income tax and related interest reserves recorded in other current liabilities were slightly more than million 
reserve adjustments for individual issues have generally not exceeded percent of earnings before income taxes and after tax earnings from joint ventures annually 
nevertheless  the accumulation of individually insignificant discrete adjustments throughout a particular year has historically impacted our consolidated effective income tax rate by up to basis points 

table of contents the internal revenue service irs recently concluded field examinations for our and federal tax years 
these examinations included review of our determinations of cost basis  capital losses  and the depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of intangible assets arising from our acquisition of pillsbury and the sale of minority interests in our gmc subsidiary 
the irs has proposed adjustments related to a majority of the tax benefits associated with these items 
we believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to vigorously defend our positions 
our potential liability for this matter is significant and  notwithstanding our reserves against this potential liability  an unfavorable resolution could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows from operations 
defined benefit pension  other postretirement  and postemployment benefit plans we have defined benefit pension plans covering most domestic  canadian  and united kingdom employees 
benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation 
benefits for hourly employees include various monthly amounts for each year of credited service 
our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws 
we made million of voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would vest if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control 
we also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to the majority of our domestic and canadian retirees 
the salaried health care benefit plan is contributory  with retiree contributions based on years of service 
we fund related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis and made million of voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal under certain circumstances  we also provide accruable benefits to former or inactive employees in the united states and canada and members of our board of directors  including severance  long term disability  and certain other benefits payable upon death 
we recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service 
postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service are charged to expense when incurred 
our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded 
we account for our defined benefit pension  other postretirement  and postemployment benefit plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost  and sfas  which was issued in september and is effective for us as of may  sfas requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which is a component of stockholders equity 
as a result of the implementation of sfas  we recognized an after tax decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income loss of million for all of our defined benefit pension  other postretirement  and postemployment benefit plans 
this includes the incremental impact of recognizing our share of the underfunded status of cpw s defined benefit pension plan in the united kingdom 
prior periods were not restated 
we recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants active working life 
accordingly  we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations 
assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long term rates of return on plan assets  the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans  and the health care cost trend rates 
expected rate of return on plan assets our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation  our historical long term investment performance  our estimate of future long term returns by asset class using input from our actuaries  investment services  and investment managers  and long term inflation assumptions 
we review this assumption annually for each plan  however  our annual investment performance for one particular year does not  by itself  significantly influence our evaluation 
our expected rates of return are revised only when our future investment performance based on our asset allocations  investment strategies  or capital markets change significantly 
the investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us 
our goal is to optimize the long term return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk 
the defined benefit pension and other postretirement portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes 
within asset classes  the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations 
for the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans  the long term investment policy allocations are percent to equities in the united states  percent to international equities  percent to private equities  
table of contents percent to fixed income  and percent to real assets real estate  energy and timber 
the actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the long term policy allocations based on relative market valuations 
our historical investment returns compound annual growth rates for our united states defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan assets were percent  percent  percent  percent  and percent for the     and year periods ended may  for fiscal  we assumed  on a weighted average basis for all defined benefit plans  a rate of return of percent 
for fiscal and  we assumed  on a weighted average basis for all defined benefit plan assets  a rate of return of percent 
our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the united states have an expected return on plan assets of percent 
during fiscal  we lowered the expected rate of return on one of our other postretirement plans in the united states based on costs associated with insurance contracts owned by that plan 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on assets by basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by million for fiscal a basis point shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan assets for fiscal would result in a similar amount of arising asset experience loss 
any arising asset experience loss is recognized on a market related valuation basis  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income 
discount rates our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for all of our defined benefit pension  other postretirement  and postemployment benefit plan obligations 
those same discount rates also are used to determine defined benefit pension  other postretirement  and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year 
we work with our actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and  using aa rated corporate bond yields  to develop a forward interest rate curve  including a margin to that index based on our credit risk 
this forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions 
our weighted average discount rates were as follows weighted average discount rates defined benefit pension plans other postretirement benefit plans postemployment benefit plans obligation as of may   and fiscal expense obligation as of may   and fiscal expense fiscal expense lowering the discount rates by basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension  other postretirement  and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal by approximately million 
all obligation related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 
health care cost trend rates we review our health care trend rates annually 
our review is based on data and information we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries 
this information includes recent plan experience  plan design  overall industry experience and projections  and assumptions used by other similar organizations 
our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review  recent experiences  and short term expectations 
our current health care cost trend rate assumption is percent for retirees age and over and percent for retirees under age these rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of percent is reached in for retirees over age and for retirees under age the trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees benefits increase as a result of health care inflation 
the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually  as necessary  to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium 
assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans 

table of contents a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects in millions one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease effect on the aggregate of the service and interest cost components in fiscal effect on the other postretirement accumulated benefit obligation as of may  any arising health care claims cost related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims 
once recognized  experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over years  resulting in at least the minimum amortization required being recorded 
financial statement impact in fiscal  we recorded net defined benefit pension  other postretirement  and postemployment benefit plan expense of million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal as of may   we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of million on our pension plans  million on our other postretirement benefit plans  and million on our postemployment benefit plans  primarily as the result of decreases in our discount rate assumptions 
these unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in decreases in our future pension income and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by gaap 
as of may   we changed to the retirement plans rp mortality table projected forward to for calculating the fiscal year end defined benefit pension  other postretirement  and postemployment benefit obligations and fiscal expense 
the impact of this change increased our defined benefit pension obligations by million and had no impact on any of our other plans 
the change also increased fiscal defined benefit pension expenses by million 
actual future net defined benefit pension  other postretirement  and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance  changes in future discount rates  changes in health care trend rates  and various other factors related to the populations participating in these plans 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in the first quarter of fiscal  we will adopt financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
among other things  fin requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions 
for the periods presented  our policy was to establish reserves that reflected the probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
favorable resolution was recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
as compared to a contingency approach  fin is based on a benefit recognition model  which we believe could result in a greater amount of benefit and a lower amount of reserve being initially recognized in certain circumstances 
provided that the tax position is deemed more likely than not of being sustained  fin permits a company to recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being ultimately realized upon settlement 
the tax position must be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained 
it further requires that a change in judgment related to prior years tax positions be recognized in the quarter of such change 
we anticipate million of our accrued income taxes will be reclassified as long term liabilities upon adoption 
significant tax reserve adjustments impacting our effective tax rate would be separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note to the consolidated financial statements appearing on pages through in item of this report 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin in june  the fasb approved the issuance of emerging issues task force issue no 
accounting for income tax benefits of dividends on share based payment awards eitf 
eitf requires that tax benefits from dividends paid on unvested restricted shares be charged directly to stockholders equity instead of benefiting income tax expense 
eitf  which will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal  is expected to increase our effective income tax rate by basis points  or from percent to percent based on our actual effective tax rate 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of sfas no 
sfas 
this statement provides companies with an option to measure  at specified election dates  many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently measured at fair value 
a company that adopts sfas will report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
this statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   which for us is the first quarter of fiscal we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
this statement provides a single definition of fair value  a framework for measuring fair value  and expanded disclosures concerning fair value 
previously  different definitions of fair value were contained in various accounting pronouncements creating inconsistencies in measurement and disclosures 
sfas applies under those previously issued pronouncements that prescribe fair value as the relevant measure of value  except sfas r and related interpretations and pronouncements that require or permit measurement similar to fair value but are not intended to measure fair value 
this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   which for us is the first quarter of fiscal we are evaluating the impact of sfas on our results of operations and financial condition 
in september  the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on the process and diversity in practice of quantifying financial statement misstatements resulting in the potential carryover of improper amounts on the balance sheet 
the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
sab is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal we do not believe that the adoption of sab will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
non gaap measures we have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by gaap 
for each of these non gaap financial measures  we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non gaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure  an explanation of why our management or the board of directors believes the non gaap measure provides useful information to investors  and any additional purposes for which our management or board of directors uses the non gaap measure 
these non gaap measures should be viewed in addition to  and not in lieu of  the comparable gaap measure 
total segment operating profit this non gaap measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the board of directors measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes

table of contents you should also consider the risk factors that we identify in item a on pages through of this report  which could also affect our future results 
we undertake no obligation to publicly revise any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of those statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows 
in the normal course of business  we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions  authorized under established policies that place clear controls on these activities 
the counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions 
we establish credit limits for each counterparty 
our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt  and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt 
primary exposures include us treasury rates  libor  and commercial paper rates in the united states and europe 
we use interest rate swaps and forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes  to reduce the volatility of our financing costs  and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floating rate debt  based on current and projected market conditions 
generally under these swaps  we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional principal amount 
as of may   we had billion of aggregate notional principal amount outstanding 
this includes notional amounts of offsetting swaps that neutralize our exposure to interest rates on other interest rate swaps 
see note to the consolidated financial statements on pages through in item of this report 
foreign exchange risk foreign currency fluctuations affect our net investments in foreign subsidiaries  and foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases  intercompany loans  and product shipments 
we are also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the us dollar 
our principal exposures are to the australian dollar  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  euro  and mexican peso 
we primarily use foreign currency forward contracts to selectively hedge our foreign currency cash flow exposures 
we generally do not hedge more than months forward 
we also have many net investments in foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in euros 
we hedge a portion of these net investments by issuing euro denominated commercial paper 
as of may   we had issued million of euro denominated commercial paper that we have designated as a net investment hedge and thus deferred net foreign currency transaction losses of million to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
commodity price risk many commodities we use in the production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks 
we utilize derivatives to hedge price risk for our principal ingredient and energy costs  including grains oats  wheat  and corn  oils principally soybean  non fat dry milk  natural gas  and diesel fuel 
we manage our exposures through a combination of purchase orders  long term contracts with suppliers  exchange traded futures and options  and over the counter options and swaps 
we offset our exposures based on current and projected market conditions  and generally seek to acquire the inputs at as close to our planned cost as possible 
equity instruments equity price movements affect our compensation expense as certain investments owned by our employees are revalued 
we use equity swaps to manage this market risk 
value at risk the estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices under normal market conditions 
a monte carlo value at risk var methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures 
the models assumed normal market conditions and used a percent confidence level 
the var calculation used historical interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future 
the market data were drawn from the riskmetrics data set 
the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur 
further  since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure  we 
table of contents would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposures 
the positions included in the calculations were debt  investments  interest rate swaps  foreign exchange forwards  commodity swaps  futures and options  and equity instruments 
the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities related positions that are hedged by these market risk sensitive instruments 
the table below presents the estimated maximum potential var arising from a one day loss in fair value for our interest rate  foreign currency  commodity and equity market risk sensitive instruments outstanding as of may   and may   and the average fair value impact during the year ended may  fair value impact in millions may  average during fiscal may  interest rate instruments foreign currency instruments commodity instruments equity instruments
