ebitda is not defined under generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
ebitda is a non gaap measure and has limitations because it does not include all items of income and expense that impact the company s operations 
management compensates for these limitations by also considering the company s gaap results 
the non gaap financial measure the company uses is not prepared in accordance with  and should not be considered an alternative to  measurements required by gaap  such as operating income  net income and income per share  and should not be considered measures of the company s liquidity 
the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable gaap measures

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt 
at december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents 
based on the investment interest rate and the balance as of december   a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately  on an annual basis  and likewise decrease the company s earnings and cash flows 
the company places its investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
deposits with its us issuers may exceed the amounts of federal deposit insurance provided on such deposits and deposits held outside the us are not afforded such protection 
the company is averse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
the company mitigates default risk by investing in only the safest and highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the company has not experienced any losses on deposits of cash or cash equivalents 

table of contents the company s interest expense associated with its credit facility will vary with market rates 
the company had million in variable rate debt outstanding at december  based upon the variable rate debt outstanding as of december   a hypothetical increase in interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately  on an annual basis  and likewise decrease the company s earnings and cash flows 
the company cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on its variable rate debt  nor can there be any assurance that fixed rate long term debt will be available to the company at favorable rates  if at all 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above

the company has an on going foreign exchange program to reduce any transactional foreign currency risk that impacts the income statement 
this program includes reducing non functional currencies cash balances held by any subsidiaries  using natural hedges to offset non functional currency intercompany balances  eliminating non functional intercompany balances where possible  and using forward contracts 
all foreign currency forward contracts are settled within the applicable accounting period  and realized gains and losses are included in the income statement as a result of the settled contracts
