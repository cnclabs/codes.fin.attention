item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  which is included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
drug development approach we seek to develop a pipeline of promising drug candidates that addresses unmet medical needs 
as our pipeline of projects has matured over the past few years  we have focused our resources on the advancement of our pipeline of potential protein  antibody  adc and small molecule drug candidates into and through clinical development 
we currently focus the majority of our financial and human resources on our oncology drug candidates in the areas of cancer supportive care and cancer treatment 
we also maintain additional assets including protein  antibody  adc and small molecule drug candidates in various stages of development across the therapeutic areas of oncology  inflammatory diseases and diabetes 
we have established strategic collaborations to support the development of our pipeline including amgen fremont to generate fully human monoclonal antibodies against our drug targets  topotarget to access small molecule hdac inhibitors for oncology and inflammatory diseases  seattle genetics to access antibody drug conjugation technology for our adc projects  and bayer for the identification and development of small molecule compounds for diabetes 
we also utilize contract manufacturing organizations for the manufacturing of our clinical development products according to current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  and contract research organizations to support specific preclinical and clinical initiatives 
our research and development groups have the expertise to move our drug candidates through all phases of preclinical and clinical development 
we utilize a project team matrix approach which combines the skills found in each of the following individual groups in order to enhance communication and incorporate expertise from all of the skilled personnel required to efficiently advance our drug candidates through development clinical development is a strong multidisciplinary team with depth and experience in all areas required for effective clinical development 
in addition to core expertise in medicine and clinical science  the group includes drug development professionals with specialized skills  who oversee clinical trial design and direction  study implementation and oversight of contract research organizations  biostatistics and data management  drug safety evaluation and adverse event reporting  regulatory affairs is responsible for communicating with regulatory agencies  including preparing and submitting all documents  and assuring that our development programs are conducted in compliance with all regulatory requirements 
these professionals combine the ability to continuously monitor and assess the ever changing regulatory requirements with the ability to translate those regulations into pragmatic advice for our development projects  project management assures that each investigational compound advances through development appropriately 
careful planning and coordination facilitate the efficient use of internal and external resources 
this group is comprised of development professionals with specialized project management experience in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  
table of contents quality assurance assures that the manufacturing of the investigational compounds used in our clinical trials adhere to the requirements set forth by the regulatory agencies 
this group includes individuals with experience obtained at pharmaceutical and large biotechnology companies assuring the quality of investigational compounds used in clinical trials and commercial products sold following regulatory approval  protein manufacturing provides process development work which results in technology transfer of those processes to a contracted cgmp facility for the manufacture of gmp material to support clinical development or commercialization of a product 
additionally  this group manufactures non gmp material for in vitro and in vivo animal pharmacology  toxicology work to support preclinical development activities for our early and advanced pipeline activities  and preclinical development conducts all in vitro and in vivo studies with our investigational compounds prior to and during clinical development 
the researchers in this group evaluate our investigational compounds in studies necessary to understand biologic activity and pharmacokinetics  including absorption  distribution  metabolism and excretion 
strategic collaborations we have established a pipeline of potential therapeutics by collaborating with  and leveraging the capabilities of  industry leaders to more efficiently advance our programs  reduce risk and conserve resources 
we have developed five classes of drug candidates protein therapeutics  which are developed in house  fully human monoclonal antibody therapeutics  which are developed in collaboration with amgen fremont  small molecule therapeutics for oncology and inflammatory diseases  which are developed in collaboration with topotarget  adcs  which are developed using antibodies generated by amgen fremont and adc technology from seattle genetics  and small molecule therapeutics for diabetes and metabolic disorders  which are developed in collaboration with bayer 
amgen fremont formerly abgenix in december  we entered into a strategic collaboration with abgenix to develop fully human monoclonal antibody therapeutics using abgenix xenomouse technology 
we amended and restructured this alliance in november and april the initial phase of the agreement  involving the identification of targets and the initiation of antibody generation  was completed in june in april  amgen inc acquired abgenix  and abgenix now operates as a wholly owned subsidiary known as amgen fremont 
in accordance with the terms of the agreement pertaining to change of control  amgen fremont assumed all obligations of the agreement 
we and amgen fremont continue to jointly characterize antibody candidates under the research phase of the alliance and to date have identified ten antibodies with commercial product potential 
we have elected to further develop nine of these antibodies and amgen fremont has elected to further develop one 
under the agreement  antibodies resulting from the strategic alliance are available for characterization and allocation until december under the agreement  once an antibody program is allocated to a party  that party is responsible for advancing the program through development and commercialization 
the developing party is obligated to pay milestone and royalty payments to the other party for any product that is commercialized 
potential aggregate milestone payments payable per product launched are approximately million  excluding any third party milestone payments payable by abgenix that we would pay if we launched a product 
topotarget in june  we signed a license and collaboration agreement with topotarget to develop belinostat pxd  a novel hdac inhibitor for the treatment of solid and hematologic malignancies  and identify additional hdac inhibitors from topotarget s extensive library of compounds 

table of contents under the terms of the agreement  we acquired the exclusive right to develop and commercialize belinostat pxd in all markets other than europe  where topotarget has retained commercialization rights 
in june  we paid a million perpetual license fee to topotarget and made a million equity investment that was recorded as a convertible loan receivable 
in june  we converted this loan into  shares of topotarget common stock following topotarget s initial public offering on the copenhagen stock exchange 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid topotarget million in development milestones from june through december additionally  the topotarget research program received million in research support during the period from june through december an additional million in research support may be made during the period from january through june  and up to million in additional milestone payments based on successful development  regulatory approval  and commercialization of belinostat pxd 
topotarget is entitled to receive royalties from us based on sales of belinostat pxd outside of europe and we are entitled to receive reciprocal royalties from topotarget based on sales of belinostat pxd in europe 
we will fund the global development of belinostat pxd 
in addition  we have an option to select additional hdac compounds from topotarget for clinical development in oncology and other indications for a fee payable by us to topotarget not to exceed million and up to million in milestone payments based on successful development  regulatory approval and commercialization of each additional product 
topotarget has the option to fund a portion of the global development of belinostat pxd and additional products in exchange for higher royalties 
potential payments to topotarget from us based on the successful development and commercialization of belinostat pxd and two additional hdac inhibitor products could exceed million 
we are currently evaluating belinostat pxd in a number of clinical trials as a potential treatment of cancer both as a single agent and in combination with other anti cancer therapies 
the research program to identify additional hdac inhibitors from topotarget s library has a three year term and can be terminated by either party upon a change in control of the other party  and by us after the first year upon payment of a penalty equal to of the unexpended research funding  or without penalty if it becomes apparent that a commercially viable future product is unlikely to be identified 
in november  we announced with topotarget the grant of exclusive worldwide rights to leo pharma to develop  manufacture  and commercialize pxd  a preclinical hdac inhibitor  for the treatment of psoriasis and other dermatological disorders 
under the terms of the agreement between topotarget and leo pharma  topotarget received during initial payments totaling  euros approximately million 
in addition  topotarget is eligible to receive additional milestone payments of up to  euros approximately million  and tiered royalties on any future product sales 
under the terms of the existing agreement between topotarget and us  we will receive of all payments received by topotarget under the licensing agreement between topotarget and leo pharma 
seattle genetics in june  we announced the licensing of seattle genetics proprietary adc technology for use with up to two of our fully human monoclonal antibodies 
we paid an upfront fee of million for access to the adc technology for use with cr  our first fully human monoclonal antibody program to utilize this technology which we announced in october we announced in july that an ind was filed with the fda for cr vcmmae and patient enrollment was initiated in a phase i clinical trial 
an undisclosed milestone payment was made to seattle genetics following this achievement 
in february  we exercised our option to access seattle genetics adc technology for use with a second antibody program  cr  in exchange for a million payment 
in january  we announced that cr was being advanced into preclinical development 
seattle genetics adc technology employs synthetic  highly potent drugs that can be attached to antibodies using their proprietary linker systems that inactivate the potent drug during delivery 
the drug with the linker is designed to be stable in the bloodstream but to release and activate the drug payload under specific conditions 
table of contents once inside target cells  thereby sparing non target cells many of the toxic effects of traditional chemotherapy 
adcs can increase the therapeutic potential of antibodies that possess targeting ability but have limited or no inherent cell killing activity 
under the agreement  seattle genetics may receive up to million in milestone payments from us  assuming successful development of two antibody therapeutics employing adc technology  and is entitled to receive royalties from us on net sales of resulting products 
we are responsible for research  product development  manufacturing and commercialization of all products under this collaboration 
we also pay maintenance and material supply fees as well as research support payments for ongoing assistance provided by seattle genetics in developing adc products 
we may terminate any license under the agreement by providing not less than days prior written notice to seattle genetics 
bayer in january  we signed two comprehensive agreements with bayer 
the first agreement was a comprehensive alliance to discover  develop  and jointly commercialize small molecule therapeutics to treat metabolic disorders  primarily adult onset diabetes 
under this collaboration agreement  we provided therapeutic targets to bayer through february bayer is utilizing its development expertise to develop small molecule therapeutics against these targets 
bayer is responsible for funding all high throughput screening  combinatorial chemistry  medicinal chemistry and pharmacology activities until a designated preclinical stage 
thereafter  expenses are equally split with bayer for later stage preclinical and clinical compound development to fund the relevant research  development and commercialization activities 
if we commercialize any therapeutics resulting from this alliance  bayer will receive of the profits associated with that therapeutic and we will receive 
bayer may terminate the agreement if there is a change in control involving us  upon providing written notice to us within days 
in october  we announced that the first small molecule compound stemming from this collaboration  bay  was advanced to the preclinical stage 
bay is an orally available  small molecule therapeutic with the potential to treat type diabetes 
an ind application for bay was cleared by the fda in november in december  we modified the collaboration agreement as it relates to bay to revert to a tiered royalty structure under which we will receive royalties on any bay product sales but will no longer contribute to bay s development or commercialization costs 
the terms of the original agreement remain unchanged with respect to our right to co develop and co commercialize any additional compounds resulting from this collaboration 
in july  we announced that bayer plans to out license bay to a third party 
we believe that bayer s intention to license bay will have no direct impact on our near term value generation or on our cash utilization 
other in addition to the above listed alliances  we have established smaller  ongoing collaborative relationships with numerous universities  academic institutions  and individual companies to gain access to disease tissue samples  disease models  and select technologies 
we have successfully conducted research with  and have the potential to receive future milestones and royalties from various companies 
at present  we do not consider these relationships  either collectively or individually  to be of a material nature 
competition we are subject to significant competition in the development and commercialization of new drugs from organizations that are pursuing strategies  approaches  technologies and products that are similar to our own 
many of the organizations competing with us have greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities and marketing capabilities 
we face competition from a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies with products in preclinical development  clinical trials  or approved for conditions identical or similar to the ones we are pursuing 

table of contents we expect that velafermin  our fibroblast growth factor  will compete with kepivance  a keratinocyte growth factor  marketed by amgen  inc for the prevention of severe om in patients undergoing hsct 
we expect to compete in the case of velafermin  on the basis of efficacy  mechanism of action  ease of administration  and potentially economic value compared to drugs used in current practice or currently being developed 
we are aware of specific companies that are developing hdac inhibitors for use in the treatment of cancer that may be competitive with ours 
with respect to our hdac inhibitor  belinostat pxd  merck co  inc recently received fda approval to market zolinza  or vorinostat  the first hdac inhibitor approved for use in the us  for the treatment of cutaneous t cell lymphoma 
bayer schering pharma ag  gloucester pharmaceuticals  inc  methylgene  inc  and novartis pharma ag are also currently evaluating hdac inhibitors in clinical trials for the treatment of cancers  and in combinations with other chemotherapies  that are similar to approaches and indications we are pursuing 
in addition  many other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are engaged in research and development for the treatment of cancer from which we may face intense competition 
we expect to compete in the case of belinostat  on the basis of efficacy  routes of administration  and potentially safety and economic value compared to drugs used in current practice or currently being developed 
intellectual property our business and competitive position depends in part on our ability to protect our gene sequences  the proteins they encode  fully human monoclonal antibodies raised against them  small molecules  other products  information systems and proprietary databases  software and other methods and technology 
we have filed and continue to file patent applications that seek to protect commercially significant aspects of our technology  including our product candidates 
as of the date of this report  we had been issued approximately patents worldwide  including issued us patents 
we have applied for patent protection on novel genes and proteins  novel mutants of known genes and their uses  partial sequences of novel proteins and their gene sequences and uses  and novel uses for previously identified genes discovered by third parties 
we have applied for patents on antibodies against the proteins we have discovered  and we have sought or have had our partners seek patent protection on the antibodies we produce against these proteins 
we have sought and intend to continue to seek patent protection for novel uses for genes and proteins and therapeutic antibodies that may have been patented by third parties 
our patent application filings that result from the identification of genes associated with the cause or effect of a particular disease generally seek to protect the genes and the proteins encoded by such genes as well as antibodies raised against these gene products 
we also seek patent protection for our therapeutic  diagnostic  and drug screening methods and products

government regulation and product approval government authorities in the united states  at the federal  state and local level  and other countries extensively regulate  among other things  the research  development  testing  manufacture  labeling  packaging  promotion  storage  advertising  distribution  marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing 
united states government regulation in the united states  the information that must be submitted to the fda in order to obtain approval to market a new drug varies depending on whether the drug is a new product whose safety and effectiveness has not previously been demonstrated in humans or a drug whose active ingredient s and certain other properties are the same as those of a previously approved drug 
a new drug will typically follow the new drug application  or nda  route and a new biologic will typically follow the biologic license application  or bla  route 

table of contents nda and bla approval processes in the united states  the fda regulates drugs and biologics under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  or ffdca  and in the case of biologics  also under the public health service act  and the fda s implementing regulations 
failure to comply with the applicable united states requirements at any time during the product development process  approval process or after approval  may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions 
these sanctions could include the fda s refusal to approve pending applications  license suspension or revocation  withdrawal of an approval  a clinical hold  warning letters  product recalls  product seizures  total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions  fines  civil penalties or criminal prosecution 
any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us 
the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent substantial compliance with appropriate federal  state  local  and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources 
the process required by the fda before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the united states generally involves the following completion of preclinical laboratory tests  animal studies and formulation studies according to good laboratory practices  submission of an ind which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin  performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials according to good clinical practices  or gcps  to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use  submission to the fda of an nda or bla  satisfactory completion of an fda inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cgmp  to assure that the facilities  methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug s identity  strength  quality and purity or to meet standards designed to ensure the biologic s continued safety  purity and potency  and fda review and approval of the nda or bla 
once a drug candidate is identified for development  it enters the preclinical testing stage 
preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry and or biology  toxicity and formulation  as well as animal studies 
an ind sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests  the chemical structure of a small molecule or sequence of a protein or antibody drug candidate  the proposed mechanism by which the drug candidate is believed to work in the body  manufacturing information  and analytical data to the fda as part of the ind 
some preclinical or nonclinical testing may continue even after the ind is submitted 
in addition to including the results of the preclinical studies  the ind will also include a protocol detailing  among other things  the objectives of the first phase of the clinical trial  the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated and whether the first phase lends itself to an efficacy determination 
the ind automatically becomes effective days after receipt by the fda  unless the fda  within the day time period  raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trial 
in such a case  the ind sponsor and the fda must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin 
all clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with gcps regulations 
these regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent 
further  an institutional review board  or irb  for each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution 
each new clinical protocol must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind 
progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the fda and more frequently if adverse events or other certain types of other changes occur 

table of contents human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined phase i the drug candidate is initially introduced into healthy human volunteer subjects or patients with the disease 
these studies are designed to determine the safety and side effects associated with increasing dosages  absorption  metabolism  distribution and excretion  pharmacologic and mechanism of action of the drug candidate in humans  and  if possible  to gain early evidence of effectiveness 
sufficient information about a drug candidate s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects should be obtained to permit the design of well controlled  scientifically valid  phase ii studies  phase ii involves controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug candidate for a particular indication in patients with the disease or condition under study and to determine the common short term side effects and risks associated with the drug candidate 
these studies are typically well controlled  closely monitored  and conducted in a relatively small number of patients  usually involving no more than several hundred patients  and phase iii clinical trials are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug candidate has been obtained  and are intended to generate additional information about the drug candidate s effectiveness and safety that is required to evaluate the overall benefit risk relationship of the drug candidate and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling 
the studies may include anywhere from several hundred to several thousand subjects 
phase i  phase ii  and phase iii testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period  if at all 
the fda  an irb or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
concurrent with clinical trials  companies usually complete additional animal studies 
companies must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cgmp requirements 
the manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality  purity and potency of the final drugs 
additionally  appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life 
the results of product development  preclinical studies and clinical studies  along with descriptions of the manufacturing process  analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug  results of chemical studies and other relevant information are submitted to the fda as part of an nda or bla requesting approval to market the product 
the fda reviews all ndas and blas submitted before it accepts them for filing 
it may request additional information rather than accept an nda or bla for filing 
in this event  the nda or bla must be resubmitted with the additional information 
the resubmitted application also is subject to review before the fda accepts it for filing 
once the submission is accepted for filing  the fda begins an in depth review 
the submission of an nda or bla is subject to the payment of user fees  but a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain circumstances 
the fda may refuse to approve an nda or bla if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data 
even if such data is submitted  the fda may ultimately decide that the nda or bla does not satisfy the criteria for approval 
the fda reviews an nda to determine  among other things  whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cgmp compliant to assure and preserve the product s identity  strength  quality and purity 
the fda reviews a bla to determine  among other things  whether the product is safe  pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured  processed  packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product s continued safety  purity and potency 
before approving an nda or bla  the fda will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured 
expedited review and approval the fda has various programs  including fast track  priority review  and accelerated approval  that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs  and or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints 
even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs  we cannot be sure that the fda 
table of contents will not later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for fda review or approval will be shortened 
generally  drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life threatening conditions  those with the potential to address unmet medical needs  and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments 
fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied 
although fast track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval  the fda will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a fast track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review 
in december  the fda granted us fast track status on velafermin  for the prevention of om in patients receiving hsct following myeloablative chemotherapy with or without tbi 
drugs that receive an accelerated approval may be approved on the basis of adequate and well controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect of a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity 
as a condition of approval  the fda may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post marketing clinical trials 
orphan drug under the orphan drug act  the fda may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition  which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than  individuals in the united states  or more than  individuals in the united states and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the united states a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the united states for that drug 
orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an nda 
after the fda grants orphan drug designation  the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the fda 
orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process 
if a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first fda approval for the disease for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity  which means that the fda may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication  except in very limited circumstances  for seven years 
orphan drug exclusivity  however  also could block the approval of our product for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the fda or if our product is determined to be contained within the competitor s product for the same indication or disease 
in february  the fda granted us orphan drug designation on velafermin  for the treatment of radiation induced om 
in november  the fda granted us orphan drug designation on cr  as a potential treatment to slow the progression of iga nephropathy and delay kidney failure in patients affected by the disease 
we intend to file for orphan drug designation for any other product candidates that meet the criteria for orphan designation 
there is no guarantee that we will be awarded orphan exclusivity for any of our other product candidates or indications 
in addition  obtaining fda approval to market a product with orphan drug exclusivity may not provide us with a material commercial advantage 
pediatric exclusivity the fda modernization act of included a pediatric exclusivity provision that was extended by the best pharmaceuticals for children act of pediatric exclusivity is designed to provide an incentive to manufacturers to conduct research about the safety of their products in children 
pediatric exclusivity  if granted  provides an additional six months of market exclusivity in the united states for new or currently marketed drugs 
under section a of the ffdca  six months of market exclusivity may be granted in exchange for the voluntary completion of pediatric studies in accordance with an fda issued written request 
the fda may issue a written request for studies on unapproved or approved indications  where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population  or part of the pediatric population  may produce health benefits in that population 
we have not requested or received a written request for such pediatric studies  although we may ask the fda to issue a written request for such studies in the future 
to receive the six month pediatric market exclusivity  we would have to receive a written request from the fda  conduct the requested studies  and submit reports of the studies in accordance with a written agreement with the fda or  if there is no 
table of contents written agreement  in accordance with commonly accepted scientific principles 
there is no guarantee that the fda will issue a written request for such studies or accept the reports of the studies 
the current pediatric exclusivity provision is scheduled to end on october   and it may not be reauthorized 
post approval requirements once an approval is granted  the fda may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market 
after approval  some types of changes to the approved product  such as adding new indications  manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims  are subject to further fda review and approval 
in addition  the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized  and the fda has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post marketing programs 
any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to fda approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the fda  including  among other things  record keeping requirements  reporting of adverse experiences with the drug  providing the fda with updated safety and efficacy information  drug sampling and distribution requirements  notifying the fda and gaining its approval of certain manufacturing or labeling changes  complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements  and complying with fda promotion and advertising requirements 
drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the fda and certain state agencies  and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the fda and certain state agencies for compliance with cgmp and other laws 
we rely  and expect to continue to rely  on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products 
future fda and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution  or require substantial resources to correct 
from time to time  legislation is drafted  introduced and passed in congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval  manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the fda 
in addition  fda regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products 
it is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted  or fda regulations  guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes  if any  may be 
foreign regulation in addition to regulations in the untied states  we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products 
whether or not we obtain fda approval for a product  we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries 
the approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country 
under european union regulatory systems  we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure 
the centralized procedure  which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology and optional for those which are highly innovative  provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all european union member states 
the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions 
under the decentralized procedure  the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states 
within days of receiving the applications and assessments report each member state must decide whether to recognize approval 
if a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization  the disputed points are eventually referred to the european commission  whose decision is binding on all member states 
as in the united states  we may 
table of contents apply for designation of our products as orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the european union before the application for marketing authorization is made 
orphan drugs in europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits  including a year market exclusivity period for the approved indication  but not for the same drug  unless another applicant can show that its product is safer  more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan designated product 
reimbursement sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of third party reimbursement 
we anticipate third party payors will provide reimbursement for our products 
it is time consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third party payors 
reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis 
the passage of the medicare prescription drug and modernization act of  or the mma  imposes new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for medicare beneficiaries  which may affect the marketing of our products 
the mma also introduced a new reimbursement methodology  part of which went into effect in at this point  it is not clear what effect the mma will have on the prices paid for currently approved drugs and the pricing options for new drugs approved after january  moreover  while the mma applies only to drug benefits for medicare beneficiaries  private payors often follow medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates 
any reduction in payment that results from the mma may result in a similar reduction in payments from non governmental payors 
in addition  in some foreign countries  the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed 
the requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country 
for example  the european union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use 
a member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market 
we expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental pricing controls 
while we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted  the adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and profitability 
life sciences corporation in june  we announced the formation of  a separate technology development subsidiary 
this majority owned subsidiary was initially funded with million primarily from investors including curagen  soros fund management  llc  cooper hill partners  llc  and members of our senior management team and board of directors 
in september  secured an additional million in equity financing from curagen and several existing stockholders  including cooper hill partners llc  to initiate commercialization of s product offering 
this second round of financing increased curagen s ownership from to

currently s sequencing technology consists of s gs  gs flx  reagent kits  disposables and a suite of analysis software 
commencing in  began offering  on a fee for service basis  high throughput sequencing at its sequencing center  or sc  for the analysis of virus  bacteria and small fungi 
in may  received a two year  million federal grant from the national human genome research institute  or nhgri  one of the national institutes of health  or nih 
in october  was awarded a three year  million grant from the nhgri 
has used these grants to partially fund the scale up of its technology 

table of contents in february  began commercializing its instrument systems and reagents with the launch of the gs the gs sequences more than million bases  from over  independent dna fragments  per five hour run on a single instrument 
the software included with the gs enables mapping of the fragments against a reference genome up to billion bases in size or de novo assembly for whole genome shotgun sequencing of genomes up to million bases 
many biologically meaningful and complex regions of genomes can be analyzed with this system without the time or cost constraints of current dna sequencing methods 
in may  entered into an exclusive five year worldwide license  supply and distribution agreement with f 
hoffman la roche  or roche license agreement for the promotion  sale  and distribution of s products  including the gs  and proprietary kits and reagents  by roche diagnostics  or roche 
in october  roche began promoting  selling and distributing s products to customers in north america  europe and asia 
under the terms of the roche license agreement  roche may sell s products for use in any high throughput sequencing applications  with the exception of regulated diagnostics 
manufactures and supplies instrument systems and reagents to roche at an agreed upon transfer price  and earns a royalty on sales to third parties completed by roche 
roche has the right to negotiate distribution of s products for use in the regulated diagnostic market and for renewal of the distribution agreement contingent upon meeting minimum performance criteria 
in  received million in milestone payments from roche  consisting of million of pre commercialization milestones and million for the commercial launch by roche of the gs and proprietary kits and reagents 
during october  received a million milestone from roche for the cumulative sale of an agreed upon number of instruments 
as of december   had a worldwide installed base of more than genome sequencer systems 
in january  and roche applied science announced the launch of the gs flx by roche  which roche began selling in december the gs flx generates longer reads of dna fragments averaging between to bases  depending on the application and the organism  an average of  reads per run  average single read accuracy of greater than over bases  consensus accuracy of greater than  and higher throughput resulting in a yield of approximately million bases per hour run 
also announced that gs systems already in use by customers can be easily upgraded on site to the gs flx 
received a million milestone payment from roche for the commercial launch of the gs flx in january the operations of are run by a separate management team and governed by a board of directors made up of members of curagen s management team  our board of directors  and an independent director 
has also established a scientific advisory board that is comprised of an elite group of scientists in the fields of whole genome sequencing  infectious disease  human genetics  chemical engineering and bioinformatics 
as s instruments and reagents are commercialized by roche across the life sciences industry and contract sequencing services are performed by  we anticipate that will continue to contribute revenue and value to the consolidated entity 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for segment reporting 
will continue to incur substantial research and development expenses as it scales up its technology to routinely analyze larger model organisms  including human dna  and to develop other sequencing applications for its technology 
our previously announced engagement of goldman sachs for the review of curagen s investment in is ongoing and focused on implementing a strategic option 
technology s sequencing technology is derived from its proprietary  emulsion based  clonal amplification process  or empcr  and its simultaneous sequencing by synthesis of hundred of thousands of dna fragments in parallel on a picotiterplate substrate 
with empcr  a single fragment of dna can be clonally amplified  or multiplied  into approximately ten million identical copies in an average of eight hours of laboratory time 
one preparation is sufficient for the sequencing of an entire genome  whether from a virus  bacteria or a human 
the picotiterplate is a glass plate consisting of million individual picoliter wells into which dna fragments are deposited for sequencing 
at the core of the genome sequencer system is a compact instrument that integrates fluidics  optics 
table of contents and computing systems 
the genome sequencer system delivers sequencing reagents to the picotiterplate  captures the chemi luminescent signal created during the sequencing process  and analyzes and processes the sequenced data 
the gs flx system currently sequences approximately one hundred million bases during one seven and a half hour run 
sequencing center offers genome sequencing services at its sc on a fee for service basis 
sc customers provide dna samples to who sequences and packages the resulting data for its customers in an electronic format 
the sc service offerings include whole genome de novo or variant resequencing of bacteria or fungi  animal and plant sequencing  bacterial artificial chromosome  or bac  clones and bac pools  amplified tags  metagenomic samples and complementary deoxyribonucleic acid  or cdna  de novo transcriptome or transcript resequencing 
the sc also offers ultra deep sequencing  including the analysis of human genes involved in cancer 
genome sequencer systems the gs flx and reagents are available exclusively from roche applied science 
the gs flx includes instrument and accessories  reagents and consumables for library construction  amplification and sequencing  and analysis software for mapping and de novo assembly 
the gs and reagents are also available exclusively from roche applied science  and will continue to be supported following the launch of the gs flx 
the gs can be upgraded to the gs flx for current customers  on site 
patents and licenses s products and services are based on the combination of several complex technologies 
as part of the initial capitalization of in june  curagen contributed and licensed certain technologies for conducting genomic analysis 
since june  has developed some of these technologies internally and has pursued patent protection in the us and other countries for certain developments  improvements  and inventions it has developed that are incorporated into s products or that fall within its fields of interest 
other of the technologies of interest to are owned by third parties and are used by under license  such as the biotage ab formerly pyrosequencing ab license agreement outlined in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the rights that considers important to its current business include patents or patent applications directed to nucleic acid sample preparation and amplification  as well as certain sequencing by synthesis approaches 
competition the current market for dna sequencing instruments and reagents is supplied almost entirely by applied biosystems  or abi 
according to strategic directions international  inc  abi supplies approximately of this market 
abi offers a range of sequencing instruments from low to high throughput 
a large portion of the balance of the market is supplied by amersham biosciences  part of ge healthcare 
another group of competitors  including affymetrix and illumina  inc  or illumina utilize hybridization arrays 
these two companies together lead the gene expression and snp genotyping markets where researchers are focused on the investigation of known mutations and not de novo sequencing of dna 
an alternative hybridization approach for re sequencing known genomes is being pursued by agencourt  based on the work of professor george church at harvard university 
there are several companies that are attempting to develop alternative sequencing by synthesis technologies  including illumina  helicos  inc  or helicos visigen and pacific biosciences  inc  or pacific biosciences 
with the exception of illumina which recently began shipping its genome analyzer  we believe that 
table of contents none of these companies currently has a product for sale or a sequencing service using their technology 
sequencing by measuring voltage change as dna molecules pass through nanopores is an alternative technology being pursued by several academic labs and funded by the us government 
this technology is still in its earliest investigation phase and is not yet commercially available 
employees as of december   curagen and had an aggregate of full and part time employees 
our employees include engineers  physicians  molecular biologists  chemists  accountants  lawyers  and computer scientists 
we believe that we maintain good relationships with our employees 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain experienced and skilled employees

risk factors statements contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k that are not based on historical fact are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the exchange act 
these forward looking statements regarding future events and our future results are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts  and projections and the beliefs and assumptions of our management including  without limitation  our expectations regarding results of operations  selling  general and administrative expenses  research and development expenses  the sufficiency of our cash for future operations  and the success of our preclinical  clinical and development programs 
forward looking statements may be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  could  will  expect  estimate  anticipate  continue  or similar terms  variations of such terms or the negative of those terms 
we cannot assure investors that our assumptions and expectations will prove to have been correct 
important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated or implied by forward looking statements 
such factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those factors discussed below 
we undertake no intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer 
risks related to our business we have a history of operating losses and expect to incur losses in the future 
we have incurred losses since inception  principally as a result of research and development and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations 
we experienced net losses of million in  million in and million in  and as of december  had an accumulated deficit of million 
we anticipate incurring additional losses as we focus our resources on prioritizing  selecting  and advancing our most promising drug candidates 
we may never be profitable or achieve significant revenues 
we can not ensure that our existing cash and investment balances will be sufficient to meet our requirements for the future 
we believe that our existing cash and investment balances and other sources of liquidity  will be sufficient to meet our requirements through the middle of we consider our operating and capital expenditures to be crucial to our future success  and by continuing to make strategic investments in our preclinical and clinical drug pipeline  as well as  we believe that we are building substantial value for our stockholders 
the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors 
these factors include the number  breadth  progress and results of our research  product development and clinical programs  the amounts and timing of sales of s products and services  the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our products  examination of strategic options to monetize our investment in  in licensing and out licensing of pharmaceutical products  and costs incurred in enforcing and defending our patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
while we will continue to explore alternative sources for financing our business activities  including the possibility of public securities offerings and or private strategic driven common stock offerings  we cannot be certain that in the future these sources of liquidity will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated 
in appropriate strategic situations  we may seek financial assistance from other sources  including contributions by others to joint ventures  other collaborative or licensing arrangements for the development and testing of products under development and strategic options with respect to monetizing our investment in however  should we be unable to obtain future financing either through the methods described above or through other means  we may be unable to meet the critical objective of our long term business plan  which is to successfully develop and market pharmaceutical products  and may be unable to continue operations 
this result could cause our stockholders to lose all or a substantial portion of their investment 

table of contents all of our drug candidates are still in the early stages of development and remain subject to clinical testing and regulatory approval 
if we are unable to successfully develop and test our drug candidates  we will not be successful 
to date  we have not marketed  distributed or sold any drug candidates 
the success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to develop and commercialize our drug candidates successfully 
our most advanced drug candidates are velafermin  which is currently in a phase ii clinical trial  belinostat pxd  which is in multiple phase i and phase ii clinical trials  cr vcmmae  which is currently in a phase i ii clinical trial  and cr  which completed a phase i clinical trial in july our other drug candidates are in various stages of preclinical development 
our drug candidates must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before they can be approved for sale 
to satisfy these standards  we must engage in expensive and lengthy testing and obtain regulatory approval of our drug candidates 
despite our efforts  our drug candidates may not offer therapeutic or other improvement over existing comparable drugs  be proven safe and effective in clinical trials  meet applicable regulatory standards  be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at acceptable costs  or be successfully commercialized 
positive results in preclinical studies of a drug candidate may not be predictive of similar results in humans during clinical trials  and promising results from early clinical trials of a drug candidate may not be replicated in later clinical trials 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in early stage development 
accordingly  the results from the completed preclinical studies and clinical trials and ongoing clinical trials for velafermin  belinostat pxd  cr vcmmae and our other drug candidates may not be predictive of the safety  efficacy or dosing results we may obtain in later stage trials 
we do not expect any of our drug candidates to be commercially available for at least several years 
if we are unable to obtain us and or foreign regulatory approval  we will be unable to commercialize our drug candidates 
our drug candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to development  clinical trials  manufacturing and commercialization 
rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process are required in the united states and in many foreign jurisdictions prior to the commercial sale of our drug candidates 
satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly  time consuming  uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays 
it is possible that none of the drug candidates we are developing will obtain marketing approval 
in connection with the clinical trials for velafermin  belinostat pxd  cr vcmmae and any other drug candidate we may seek to develop in the future  we face risks that the drug candidate may not prove to be efficacious  the drug may not prove to be safe  the results may not confirm the positive results from earlier preclinical studies or clinical trials  and the results may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the fda or other regulatory authorities 
we have limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals  including approval by the fda 
the time required to complete clinical trials and for the fda and other countries regulatory review processes is uncertain and typically takes many years 
our analysis of data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory 
table of contents authorities  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
we may also encounter unanticipated delays or increased costs due to government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in fda policy during the period of product development  clinical trials and fda regulatory review 
any delay in obtaining  or failure to obtain  required approvals could materially adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the particular drug candidate 
furthermore  any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market the product 
these limitations may limit the size of the market for the product 
we are also subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  manufacturing and marketing authorization  pricing and third party reimbursement 
the foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with fda approval described above as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of foreign requirements 
approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities outside the united states 
foreign jurisdictions may have different approval procedures than those required by the fda and may impose additional testing requirements for our drug candidates 
if clinical trials for our drug candidates are prolonged or delayed  we may be unable to commercialize our drug candidates on a timely basis  which would require us to incur additional costs and delay our receipt of any product revenue 
we cannot predict whether we will encounter problems with any of our completed  ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or regulatory authorities to delay or suspend clinical trials  or delay the analysis of data from our completed or ongoing clinical trials 
any of the following could delay the clinical development of our drug candidates ongoing discussions with the fda or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials  delays in receiving or the inability to obtain required approvals from institutional review boards or other reviewing entities at clinical sites selected for participation in our clinical trials  delays in enrolling volunteers and patients into clinical trials  a lower than anticipated retention rate of volunteers and patients in clinical trials  the need to repeat clinical trials as a result of inconclusive or negative results or unforeseen complications in testing  inadequate supply or deficient quality of drug candidate materials or other materials necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials  unfavorable fda inspection and review of a clinical trial site or records of any clinical or preclinical investigation  serious and unexpected drug related side effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials  or the placement by the fda of a clinical hold on a trial 
our ability to enroll patients in our clinical trials in sufficient numbers and on a timely basis will be subject to a number of factors  including the size of the patient population  the nature of the protocol  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial 
delays in patient enrollment may result in increased costs and longer development times 
in addition  subjects may withdraw from our clinical trials  and thereby impair the validity or statistical significance of the trials 
we  the fda or other applicable regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials of a drug candidate at any time if we or they believe the subjects or patients participating in such clinical trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or for other reasons 

table of contents we cannot predict whether any of our drug candidates will encounter problems during clinical trials which will cause us or regulatory authorities to delay or suspend these trials  or which will delay the analysis of data from these trials 
in addition  it is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted  or whether fda regulations  guidance or interpretations will be changed  or what the impact of such changes  if any  may be 
if we experience any such problems  we may not have the financial resources to continue development of the drug candidate that is affected or the development of any of our other drug candidates 
even if we obtain regulatory approvals  our drug candidates will be subject to ongoing regulatory review 
if we fail to comply with continuing us and applicable foreign regulations  we could lose those approvals  and our business would be seriously harmed 
even if we receive regulatory approval of any drugs we may develop  we will be subject to continuing regulatory review  including the review of clinical results which are reported after our drug candidates become commercially available approved drugs 
since drugs are more widely used by patients once approval has been obtained  side effects and other problems may be observed after approval that were not seen or anticipated during pre approval clinical trials 
in addition  the manufacturer  and the manufacturing facilities we use to make any of our drug candidates  will also be subject to periodic review and inspection by the fda 
the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the drug  manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the drug  manufacturer or facility  including withdrawal of the drug from the market 
if we fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements  we may be subject to fines  suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval  product recalls and seizures  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions 
our business has a substantial risk of product liability claims 
if we are unable to obtain appropriate levels of insurance  a product liability claim could adversely affect our business 
our business exposes us to significant potential product liability risks that are inherent in the development  manufacturing and sales and marketing of human therapeutic products 
although we do not currently commercialize any products  claims could be made against us based on the use of our drug candidates in clinical trials 
we currently have clinical trial insurance and will seek to obtain product liability insurance prior to the sales and marketing of any of our drug candidates 
however  our insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
furthermore  clinical trial and product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive 
as a result  we may be unable to maintain current amounts of insurance coverage or obtain additional or sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost to protect against losses that could have a material adverse effect on us 
if a claim is brought against us  we might be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim  as well as uncovered damages awards resulting from a claim brought successfully against us 
furthermore  whether or not we are ultimately successful in defending any such claims  we might be required to direct significant financial and managerial resources to such defense  and adverse publicity is likely to result 
if we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our drug candidates  we may not generate product revenue 
we have no commercial products  and we do not currently have an organization for the sales and marketing of pharmaceutical products 
in order to successfully commercialize any drugs that may be approved in the future by the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities  we must build our sales and marketing capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services 
there are risks involved with establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities  as well as entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services 
for example  developing a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch 
in addition  to the extent that we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales  marketing and distribution services  we will have less control over sales of our products  and our future revenues would depend heavily on the success of the efforts of these third parties 
if we are unable to establish adequate sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  whether independently or with third parties  we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable 

table of contents if physicians  patients and third party payors do not accept our future drugs  we may be unable to generate significant revenue  if any 
even if velafermin  belinostat pxd  cr vcmmae  cr vcmmae  cr  cr  bay or any other drug candidates we may develop or acquire in the future  obtain regulatory approval  they may not gain market acceptance among physicians  patients and health care payors 
physicians may elect not to recommend these drugs for a variety of reasons including timing of market introduction of competitive drugs  lower demonstrated clinical safety and efficacy compared to other drugs  lack of cost effectiveness  lack of availability of reimbursement from third party payors  convenience and ease of administration  prevalence and severity of adverse side effects  other potential advantages of alternative treatment methods  and ineffective marketing and distribution support 
if our approved drugs fail to achieve market acceptance  we would not be able to generate sufficient revenue from product sales to maintain or grow our business 
if third party payors do not adequately reimburse customers for any of our product candidates that are approved for marketing  they might not be purchased or used  and our revenues and profits will not develop or increase 
our revenues and profits will depend heavily upon the availability of adequate reimbursement for the use of our approved product candidates from governmental and other third party payors  both in the united states and in foreign markets 
reimbursement by a third party payor may depend upon a number of factors  including the third party payor s determination that use of a product is a covered benefit under its health plan  safe  effective and medically necessary  appropriate for the specific patient  cost effective  and neither experimental nor investigational 
obtaining reimbursement approval for a product from each government or other third party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific  clinical and cost effectiveness data for the use of our products to each payor 
we may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to reimbursement 
there is substantial uncertainty whether any particular payor will reimburse the use of any drug products incorporating new technology 
even when a payor determines that a product is eligible for reimbursement  the payor may impose coverage limitations that preclude payment for some uses that are approved by the fda or comparable authority 
moreover  eligibility for coverage does not imply that any product will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that allows us to make a profit or even cover our costs 
interim payments for new products  if applicable  may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent 
reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used  may be based on payments allowed for lower cost products that are already reimbursed  may be incorporated into existing payments for other products or services  and may reflect budgetary constraints and or imperfections in medicare  medicaid or other data used to calculate these rates 
net prices for 
table of contents products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government health care programs or by any future relaxation of laws that restrict imports of certain medical products from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the united states 
there have been  and we expect that there will continue to be  federal and state proposals to constrain expenditures for medical products and services  which may affect payments for our products 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  frequently change product descriptors  coverage policies  product and service codes  payment methodologies and reimbursement values 
third party payors often follow medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates  and both cms and other third party payors may have sufficient market power to demand significant price reductions 
due in part to actions by third party payors  the health care industry is experiencing a trend toward containing or reducing costs through various means  including lowering reimbursement rates  limiting therapeutic class coverage and negotiating reduced payment schedules with service providers for drug products 
our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from government funded and private payors for our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our overall financial condition 
we may not be able to execute our business strategy if we are unable to enter into alliances with other companies that can provide capabilities and funds for the development and commercialization of our drug candidates 
if we are unsuccessful in forming or maintaining these alliances on favorable terms  our business may not succeed 
we have entered into collaboration arrangements with several companies for the research  development and commercialization of our drug candidates  and we may enter into additional collaborative arrangements in the future 
for example  we may enter into alliances with major biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies to jointly develop specific drug candidates and to jointly commercialize them if they are approved 
we may not be successful in entering into any such alliances on favorable terms 
even if we do succeed in securing such alliances  we may not be able to maintain them if  for example  development or approval of a drug candidate is delayed or sales of an approved drug are disappointing 
furthermore  any delay in entering into collaboration agreements could delay the development and commercialization of our drug candidates and reduce their competitiveness even if they reach the market 
any such delay related to our collaborations could adversely affect our business 
in addition to relying on a third party for its capabilities  we may depend on our alliances with other companies to provide substantial additional funding for development and potential commercialization of our drug candidates 
we may not be able to obtain funding on favorable terms from these alliances  and if we are not successful in doing so  we may not have sufficient funds to develop a particular drug candidate internally  or to bring drug candidates to market 
failure to bring our drug candidates to market will prevent us from generating sales revenues  and this may substantially harm our business 
if a collaborative partner terminates or fails to perform its obligations under agreements with us  the development and commercialization of our drug candidates could be delayed or terminated 
if any current or future collaborative partner does not devote sufficient time and resources to collaboration arrangements with us  we may not realize the potential commercial benefits of the arrangement  and our results of operations may be adversely affected 
in addition  if any existing or future collaboration partner were to breach or terminate its arrangements with us  the development and commercialization of the affected drug candidate could be delayed  curtailed or terminated because we may not have sufficient financial resources or capabilities to continue development and commercialization of the drug candidate on our own 

table of contents much of the potential revenue from our existing and future collaborations will consist of contingent payments  such as payments for achieving development milestones and royalties payable on sales of drugs developed using our technologies 
the milestone and royalty revenues that we may receive under these collaborations will depend upon our collaborator s ability to successfully develop  introduce  market and sell new products 
in addition  our collaborators may decide to enter into arrangements with third parties to commercialize products developed under our existing or future collaborations using our technologies  which could reduce the milestone and royalty revenue that we may receive  if any 
in many cases we will not be involved in these processes and accordingly will depend entirely on our collaborators 
our collaboration partners may fail to develop or effectively commercialize products using our products or technologies because they decide not to devote the necessary resources due to internal constraints  such as limited personnel with the requisite scientific expertise  limited cash resources or specialized equipment limitations  or the belief that other drug development programs may have a higher likelihood of obtaining regulatory approval or may potentially generate a greater return on investment  do not have sufficient resources necessary to carry the drug candidate through clinical development  regulatory approval and commercialization  decide to pursue a competitive drug candidate developed outside of the collaboration  or cannot obtain the necessary regulatory approvals 
if our collaboration partners fail to develop or effectively commercialize drug candidates or drugs for any of these reasons  we may not be able to replace the collaboration partner with another partner to develop and commercialize a drug candidate or drugs under the terms of the collaboration 
we may also be unable to obtain a license from such collaboration partner on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and provide other services  and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily  including failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of such services 
we do not have the ability to independently conduct some preclinical studies and the clinical trials for our drug candidates  and we rely on third parties such as contract laboratories  contract research organizations  medical institutions and clinical investigators to design and conduct these studies and our clinical trials 
our reliance on these third parties reduces our control over these activities 
accordingly  these third party contractors may not complete activities on schedule  or may not conduct the studies or our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our trial design 
to date  we believe our contract research organizations and other similar entities with which we are working have performed well 
however  if these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines  we may be required to replace them 
although we believe that there are a number of other third party contractors we could engage to continue these activities  it may result in delays 
accordingly  our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize our drug candidates may be delayed 
in addition  our ability to bring our future products to market depends on the quality and integrity of the data we present to regulatory authorities in order to obtain marketing authorizations 
we cannot guarantee the authenticity or accuracy of such data  nor can we be certain that such data has not been fraudulently generated 
the failure of these third parties to carry out their obligations would materially adversely affect our ability to develop and market new products and implement our strategies 
we currently depend on third party manufacturers to produce our preclinical and clinical drug supplies and intend to rely upon third party manufacturers to produce commercial supplies of any approved drug candidates 
if in the future we manufacture any of our drug candidates  we will be required to incur significant costs and devote significant efforts to establish and maintain these capabilities 
we have relied upon third parties to produce material for preclinical and clinical testing purposes and intend to continue to do so in the future 
although we believe that we will not have any material supply issues  we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain long term supplies of those materials on acceptable terms  if at 
table of contents all 
we also expect to rely upon third parties to produce materials required for the commercial production of our drug candidates if we succeed in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals 
if we are unable to arrange for third party manufacturing  or to do so on commercially reasonable terms  we may not be able to complete development of our drug candidates or market them 
reliance on third party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured drug candidates ourselves  including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance  the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party  based on its own business priorities  at a time that is costly or damaging to us 
in addition  the fda and other regulatory authorities require that our drug candidates be manufactured according to cgmp regulations 
any failure by us or our third party manufacturers to comply with cgmp and or our failure to scale up our manufacturing processes could lead to a delay in  or failure to obtain  regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates 
in addition  such failure could be the basis for action by the fda to withdraw approvals for drug candidates previously granted to us and for other regulatory action 
we currently rely on a single manufacturer for the preclinical and clinical supplies of our protein  antibody  and adc drug candidates and do not currently have relationships for redundant supply or a second source for any of these drug candidates 
to date  our third party manufacturers have met our manufacturing requirements  but we cannot assure that they will continue to do so 
any performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay clinical development or regulatory approval of our drug candidates or commercialization of any approved products 
if for some reason our current contract manufacturers cannot perform as agreed  we may be required to replace them 
although we believe there are a number of potential replacements as our manufacturing processes are not manufacturer specific  we may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacements 
furthermore  although we generally do not begin a clinical trial unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of a drug candidate to complete the trial  any significant delay in the supply of a drug candidate for an ongoing trial due to the need to replace a third party manufacturer could delay completion of the trial 
we may in the future elect to manufacture certain of our drug candidates in our own manufacturing facilities 
if we do so  we will require substantial additional funds and need to recruit qualified personnel in order to build or lease and operate any manufacturing facilities 
because we have limited experience in developing  commercializing and marketing products  we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to do so 
our products in development will require significant research and development and preclinical and clinical testing prior to our submitting any regulatory application for their commercial use 
these activities  even if undertaken without the collaboration of others  will require us to expend significant funds and will be subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of pharmaceutical products 
we have limited experience conducting clinical trials 
even if we complete such studies  our ability to commercialize products will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property rights to our products  enter into arrangements with third parties to manufacture our products on our behalf  and deploy sales and marketing resources effectively or enter into arrangements with third parties to provide these services 
as a result of these possibilities  we may not be able to develop any commercially viable products 
in addition  should we choose to develop pharmaceutical products internally  we will have to make significant investments in pharmaceutical product development  marketing  sales  and regulatory compliance resources  and we will have to establish or contract for the manufacture of products under the fda cgmps 
any potential products developed by our licensees will be subject to the same risks 

table of contents we do not currently have any marketed products 
if we develop products that can be marketed  we intend to market the products either independently or together with collaborators or strategic partners 
if we decide to market any products independently  we will incur significant additional expenditures and commit significant additional management resources to establish a sales force 
for any products that we market together with partners  we will rely  in whole or in part  on the marketing capabilities of those parties 
we may also contract with other third parties to market certain of our products 
ultimately  we and our partners may not be successful in marketing our products 
because neither we nor any of our collaborative partners have received marketing approval for any product resulting from our research and development efforts  and may never be able to obtain any such approval  we may not be able to generate any product revenue 
all of the products being developed by our collaborative partners will require additional research and development  extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials  and regulatory approval prior to any commercial sales 
in some cases  the length of time that it takes for our collaborative partners to achieve various regulatory approval milestones may affect the payments that we are eligible to receive under our collaboration agreements 
we and our collaborative partners may need to address a number of technical challenges successfully in order to complete development of our drug candidates 
moreover  these drug candidates may not be effective in treating any disease or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects  toxicities  or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use 
we rely significantly on our collaborative partners to gain access to specified technologies and our business could be harmed if we are unable to maintain strategic alliances 
as part of our business strategy  we have strategic research and development alliances with companies to gain access to specific technologies 
these alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may provide us with access to unique technologies  access to capital  near term revenues  milestone and or royalty payments  and potential profit sharing arrangements 
in return  we provide access to unique technologies  expertise in genomics  and information on the molecular basis of disease  drug targets  and drug candidates 
we currently have significant strategic alliances with amgen fremont  topotarget  seattle genetics  and bayer in addition to numerous smaller agreements to facilitate these efforts 
in these strategic alliances  either party can terminate the agreement at any time the alliance permits them to or if either party materially breaches the contract 
we may not be able to maintain or expand existing alliances or establish any additional alliances 
if any of our existing collaborators were to breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct activities successfully and in a timely manner  the preclinical or clinical development or commercialization of product candidates or research programs may be delayed or terminated  which may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we depend on attracting and retaining key employees 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our senior management and scientific staff  including frank m 
armstrong  md  president and chief executive officer  david m 
wurzer  executive vice president  chief financial officer and treasurer  timothy m 
shannon  md  executive vice president and chief medical officer  paul m 
finigan  senior vice president and general counsel  elizabeth a 
whayland  senior vice president and corporate secretary  and christopher k 
mcleod  president and chief executive officer of our future success will depend in part on the continued services of our key management and scientific personnel 
the loss of services of any of these personnel could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we have entered into employment agreements with all of the principal members of our senior management team 
our future success will also depend in part on our ability to attract  hire  and retain additional personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain such personnel 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could materially  adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 

table of contents we depend on academic collaborators  consultants  and scientific advisors 
we have relationships with collaborators  consultants  and scientific advisors at academic and other institutions that conduct research or provide consulting services at our request 
these collaborators  consultants  and scientific advisors are not our employees 
substantially all of our collaborators  consultants  and scientific advisors are employed by employers other than us and may have commitments to  or collaboration  consulting  or advisory contracts with  other entities that may limit their availability to us 
as a result  we have limited control over their activities and  except as otherwise required by our collaboration  consulting agreements  and advisory agreements  can expect only limited amounts of their time to be dedicated to our activities 
our ability to explore and validate biological activity of therapeutic candidates and commercialize products based on these discoveries may depend  in part  on continued collaborations with researchers at academic and other institutions 
we may not be able to negotiate additional acceptable collaborations with collaborators  consultants  or scientific advisors at academic and other institutions 
our academic collaborators  consultants  and scientific advisors may have relationships with other commercial entities  some of which could compete with us 
our academic collaborators  consultants and scientific advisors sign agreements which provide for confidentiality of our proprietary information and of the results of studies 
we may not be able to maintain the confidentiality of our technology and other confidential information in connection with every academic collaboration  consulting  or advisory arrangement  and any unauthorized dissemination of our confidential information could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
further  any such collaborator  consultant or advisor may enter into an employment agreement or consulting arrangement with one of our competitors 
competition in our field is intense and likely to increase 
we are subject to significant competition in the development and commercialization of new drugs from organizations that are pursuing strategies  approaches  technologies and products that are similar to our own 
many of the organizations competing with us have greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities and marketing capabilities 
we face competition from a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies with products in preclinical development  clinical trials  or approved for conditions identical or similar to the ones we are pursuing 
we are aware of specific companies that are developing hdac inhibitors for use in the treatment of cancer that may be competitive with ours 
with respect to our hdac inhibitor  belinostat pxd  merck co  inc recently received fda approval to market zolinza  or vorinostat  the first hdac inhibitor approved for use in the us  for the treatment of cutaneous t cell lymphoma 
bayer schering pharma ag  gloucester pharmaceuticals  inc  methylgene  inc  and novartis pharma ag are also currently evaluating hdac inhibitors in clinical trials for the treatment of cancers  and in combinations with other chemotherapies  that are similar to approaches and indications we are pursuing 
in addition  many other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are engaged in research and development for the treatment of cancer from which we may face intense competition 
we expect to compete in the case of belinostat  on the basis of efficacy  routes of administration  and potentially safety and economic value compared to drugs used in current practice or currently being developed 
we expect that our fibroblast growth factor  velafermin  will compete with kepivance  a keratinocyte growth factor  marketed by amgen  inc for the prevention of severe om in patients undergoing hsct 
we expect to compete in the case of velafermin  on the basis of efficacy  mechanism of action  ease of administration  and potentially economic value compared to drugs used in current practice or currently being developed 
if we do not obtain adequate intellectual property protection  we may not be able to prevent our competitors from commercializing our discoveries 
our business and competitive position depends on our ability to protect our products and processes  including obtaining patent protection on genes and proteins for which we or our collaborators discover utility  and on products  methods and services based on such discoveries 

table of contents the patent positions of pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical  and biotechnology companies  including us  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
the law relating to the scope of patent claims in the technology fields in which we operate is evolving  and the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain 
furthermore  even if patents are issued to us  there can be no assurance that others will not develop alternative technologies or design around the patented technologies developed by us 
therefore  our patent applications may not protect our products  processes  and technologies for at least the following reasons there is no guarantee that any of our pending patent applications will result in additional issued patents  there is no guarantee that any patents issued to us or our collaborative customers will provide a basis for commercially viable products  there is no guarantee that any patents issued to us or our collaborative customers will provide us with any competitive advantages  there is no guarantee that any patents issued to us or our collaborative customers will not be challenged or circumvented or invalidated by third parties  and there is no guarantee that any patents issued to others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 
the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability  nor does it provide the patent holder with freedom to operate without infringing the patent rights of others 
a patent could be challenged by litigation and  if the outcome of such litigation were adverse to the patent holder  competitors could be free to use the subject matter covered by the patent 
the invalidation of key patents owned by or licensed to us or the non approval of pending patent applications could increase competition and materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to us  also may be necessary to enforce our patent and proprietary rights and or to determine the scope and validity of others proprietary rights 
we may participate in interference proceedings that may in the future be declared by the uspto to determine priority of invention  which could result in substantial cost to us 
the outcome of any such litigation or interference proceeding might not be favorable to us  and we might not be able to obtain licenses to technology that we require or  even if obtainable  such technology may not be available at a reasonable cost 
if we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  we may be required to obtain a license  pay damages  and or cease the commercialization of our technology 
we believe that there may be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
it is possible that the commercialization of our technology could infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
in addition  others may have filed  and in the future are likely to file  patent applications covering genes or gene products or antibodies against the gene products that are similar or identical to our products 
any such patent applications may have priority over our patent applications  and may result in the issuance of patents to others that could be infringed by our products or processes 
a number of competitors are producing proteins from genes and claiming both the proteins as potential therapeutics as well as the antibodies against these proteins 
in many cases  generic antibody claims are being issued by the uspto even though competitors have not actually made antibodies against the protein of interest  or do not have cellular  animal  or human data to support the use of these antibodies as therapeutics 
these claims to proteins as therapeutics  to all antibodies against a protein  and to methods of use in broad human indications are being filed at a rapid rate  and patents including such claims have issued and may continue to issue 
such patents may prevent us from commercializing some products or processes or  if licenses under the patents are made available  may make the royalty burden on these products and processes so high as to prevent commercial success 

table of contents in addition  we have sought and intend to continue to seek patent protection for novel uses for genes and proteins and therapeutic antibodies that may have been patented by third parties 
in such cases  we would need a license from the holder of the patent with respect to such gene or protein in order to make  use  or sell such gene or protein for such use 
we may not be able to acquire such licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
certain third parties have indicated to us that they believe we may be required to obtain a license in order to perform certain processes that we use in the conduct of our business or in order to market potential drugs we have in development 
any legal action against us or our collaborators for patent infringement relating to our products and processes could  in addition to subjecting us to potential liability for damages  require us or our collaborators to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products and processes  or could enjoin us from continuing to manufacture or market the affected products and processes 
there can be no assurance that we or our collaborators would prevail in any such action or that any license required under any such patent would be made available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
if we become involved in such litigation  it could consume a substantial portion of our managerial and financial resources 
we cannot be certain that our security measures will protect our confidential information and proprietary technologies 
we rely upon trade secret protection for some of our confidential and proprietary information that is not the subject matter for which patent protection is being sought 
we have taken security measures to protect our proprietary technologies  processes  information systems  and data and continue to explore ways to enhance such security 
such measures  however  may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
while we require employees  academic collaborators  consultants  and scientific advisors to enter into confidentiality and or non disclosure agreements where appropriate  any of the following could still occur proprietary information could be disclosed  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets  technology  or disclose such information  or we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets 
if the security of our confidential information is breached  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we depend upon our ability to license technologies 
we may have to acquire or license certain components of our technologies or products from third parties 
we may not be able to acquire from third parties or develop new technologies  either alone or with others 
we may not be able to acquire licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
failure to license or otherwise acquire necessary technologies could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
s sequencing system and reagent kits have been offered commercially for only a short period of time and its technology platform is based on new and relatively unproven technologies and methods 
our future success depends on market acceptance of our current products and our continued research  development and commercialization efforts relating to the future versions of our sequencing systems 
began marketing  selling and distributing its sequencing system in as the gs and the next version of the sequencing system  the gs flx  is in the early stages of commercialization and future iterations of the technology are in development 
as of december   had a cumulative installed base of 
table of contents more than genome sequencer systems 
compared to well known technologies  s dna sequencing system has not yet been widely adopted or accepted 
accordingly  to be successful  s current and future sequencing systems  and the technologies underlying those products  must be accepted by s target markets 
this market acceptance and the success of s products will depend on numerous factors  including the ability to use s products for large scale applications of dna sequencing in a cost effective and dependable manner  whether customers adopt s dna sequencing systems  as opposed to the products and technologies offered by s competitors  the willingness and ability of more researchers to invest in dna sequencing technology than have already done so to date  the willingness and ability of customers to adopt new technologies requiring additional capital investment  and s ability to manufacture  market  sell and distribute its dna sequencing systems and reagent kits on a competitive cost basis 
is subject to competition from organizations that have developed or are developing technologies and products to service s potential customers 
we believe that the future success of will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position in instruments for the high throughput nucleic acid sequencing field 
before we recover development expenses for s products or technologies  such products or technologies may become obsolete as a result of technological developments by us or others 
s products could also be made obsolete by new technologies which are less expensive or more effective 
may not be able to make the enhancements to its technology necessary to compete successfully with newly emerging technologies 
the market for high throughput nucleic acid sequencing may not be sufficient to generate revenues significant enough for to achieve profitability 
the current market for dna sequencing instruments and reagents is supplied almost entirely by abi 
according to strategic directions international  inc  abi supplies approximately of this market 
abi offers a range of sequencing instruments from low to high throughput 
a large portion of the balance of the market is supplied by amersham biosciences  part of ge healthcare 
another group of competitors  including affymetrix and illumina  utilize hybridization arrays 
these two companies together lead the gene expression and snp genotyping markets where researchers are focused on the investigation of known mutations and not de novo sequencing of dna 
an alternative hybridization approach for re sequencing known genomes is being pursued by agencourt  based on the work of professor george church at harvard university 
there are several companies that are attempting to develop alternative sequencing by synthesis technologies  including illumina  helicos  visigen and pacific biosciences 
with the exception of illumina which recently began shipping its genome analyzer  we believe that none of these companies currently has a product for sale or a sequencing service using their technology 
sequencing by measuring voltage change as dna molecules pass through nanopores is an alternative technology being pursued by several academic labs and funded by the us government 
this technology is still in its earliest investigation phase and is not yet commercially available 
has a limited history of manufacturing instrument systems and consumable products  and its success  in part  depends on its ability to provide commercially successful products to roche 
has limited experience manufacturing products and consumable reagents in significant volumes 
has only recently begun manufacturing products on a commercial scale and may be unable to provide products in the volumes required  or to complete projects at its facility 
may encounter previously unknown manufacturing difficulties that could significantly reduce production or the ability to manufacture its systems and products economically 

table of contents has a limited history of managing inventory levels 
reagents are subject to obsolescence 
if inventory of consumables is not managed appropriately  this could result in having to write off expired products  potentially impacting its ability to provide products and services 
for the foreseeable future  will rely on a single distributor  roche  to generate product revenue for s products 
if roche is unable to sell s products effectively  it could materially and adversely affect the results of our operations 
has granted roche the right to be its exclusive  worldwide sales and marketing distributor for s high throughput instrument systems  proprietary kits and reagents 
as a result  is dependent on roche and its ability to effectively market s current products 
if roche is unable to sell s products effectively  will not have the ability to seek other customers for s products at least until such time as satisfactory arrangements are made with roche 
obtains key components from single source or a limited group of suppliers  and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause significant production delays  an inability to meet customer demand and a substantial loss in revenues 
depends on single source suppliers or a limited group of suppliers for some of the key components used in the sequencing system 
s dependence on this limited selection of suppliers of product components exposes it to several risks  including disruptions in supply  price increases  late deliveries or an inability to meet customer demand 
this could lead to customer dissatisfaction  damage to s reputation or cause customers to switch to competitors products 
finding alternative sources for the components provided by single source or a limited group of suppliers would be difficult in many cases and may entail a significant amount of time and disrupt s business 
in some cases  would need to change the components of its products if it changed suppliers 
this  in turn  could require a redesign of the sequencing system  thereby causing further costs and disruption to its business 
a portion of s sales are to international customers and international sales are subject to risks 
s instrument systems and reagents will be sold internationally by roche 
also offers sequencing services to clients worldwide and intends to expand its international presence 
international sales entail a variety of risks  including currency exchange fluctuations  unexpected changes in legislative or regulatory requirements of foreign countries into which products are imported  difficulties in obtaining export licenses or other trade barriers and restrictions resulting in delivery delays  and significant taxes or other burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
in addition  sales to international customers typically result in longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection 
is also subject to general geopolitical risks  such as political  social and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relations 
one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on s business  financial condition and operating results 
patents may not provide sufficient protection for the technology 
s products and services are based on the combination of several complex technologies 
has developed some of these technologies internally and has pursued patent protection in the us and other countries for certain developments  improvements  and inventions it has developed that are incorporated into s products or that fall within its fields of interest 
other of the technologies utilized by are owned by third 
table of contents parties and are used by under license 
there are relatively few decided court cases interpreting the scope of patent claims in these technologies  and believes that its products and services do not infringe upon the technology covered by valid and enforceable patents 
this belief could be successfully challenged by third parties 
s patent applications may not protect its products  processes and technologies because of the following reasons there is no guarantee that any of s pending patent applications will result in additional issued patents  may develop additional proprietary technologies that are not patentable  there is no guarantee that any patents issued to or its collaborative customers will provide a basis for commercially viable products  there is no guarantee that any patents issued to or its collaborative customers will provide with any competitive advantages  there is no guarantee that any patents issued to or its collaborative customers will not be challenged or circumvented or invalidated by third parties  and there is no guarantee that any patents issued to others will not have an adverse effect on s ability to do business 
if infringes or is alleged to infringe intellectual property rights of third parties  it will adversely affect its business 
s research  development and commercialization activities  as well as products resulting from these activities  may infringe or be claimed to infringe patents or patent applications under which it does not hold licenses or other rights 
third parties may own or control these patents and patent applications in the united states and abroad 
these third parties could bring claims against or its collaborators that would cause to incur substantial expenses and  if successful  could cause to pay substantial damages 
further  if a patent infringement suit were brought against or its collaborators  or they could be forced to stop or delay research  development  manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit 
infringement and other intellectual property claims and proceedings brought against  whether successful or not  could result in substantial costs and harm to its reputation 
such claims and proceedings can also distract and divert management and key personnel from other tasks important to the success of the business 
in addition  intellectual property litigation or claims could force to do one or more of the following cease selling or using any of its products that incorporate the asserted intellectual property  which would adversely affect revenues  pay substantial damages for past use of the asserted intellectual property  obtain a license from the holder of the asserted intellectual property  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all  and which could reduce its profitability  or redesign or rename  in the case of trademark claims  products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties  which may be impossible  impracticable and or costly and time consuming 
as a result of patent infringement claims  or to avoid potential claims  or its current or future collaborators may choose or be required to seek a license from the third party and be required to pay license fees  royalties or both 
these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
even if or its collaborators were able to obtain a license  the rights may be nonexclusive  which could result in s competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property 
ultimately  could be prevented from commercializing a product  or be forced to cease some aspect of its business operations  if  as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims  or its collaborators are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms 
this could harm s business significantly 

table of contents has recently introduced changes to its sequencing system technology 
the recent sequencing system modification or future modifications may not be acceptable to s customers  which could adversely and permanently affect its reputation with its current and potential customers and adversely affect our business 
continually makes changes to its products to improve performance and  in some cases  to lessen risk of third party patent infringement 
s current and future commercial success depends upon acceptance by its existing and potential customers of the sequencing system technology as recently modified and as may be modified in the future 
introducing modified products to s current customers is time consuming and expensive  and could result in dissatisfied customers  harm to its reputation and a reduced ability to attract new customers 
while has successfully tested recent updates to its technology in its laboratories  successful customer implementation in the field and market acceptance of the modified sequencing system will not be known until after s updated products have been commercially launched and assimilated into the marketplace 
if the changes made to the sequencing technology do not prove effective in the market  or if such changes prompt claims of patent infringement  current and potential customers may not accept s products  and may be required to undertake further changes to its product design 
if for these or other reasons s current or potential customers do not accept recent or future modifications to its sequencing technology  the demand for products could be diminished  and its reputation and our business could be adversely affected 
changes in the level of government funding for life sciences research could affect the adoption of s products and services and the level of s future product and services sales 
s current customer base  and the customer base anticipates in the near term  consists primarily of large genome centers and large academic research facilities  many of which rely heavily on government grants to finance their research programs and the acquisition of sequencing products and services 
in both the united states and abroad  political support for government funding of life sciences research  and dna sequencing in particular  is subject to varying degrees of approval and opposition  and cannot predict whether future government funding or grants will be available for researchers to purchase its products and services 
in the event further government funding and grants are reduced  its business could be adversely affected 
it is uncertain whether will be able to successfully develop and commercialize new products  including the gs flx  or to what extent can increase its revenues or become profitable 
although we  through  have developed and commercialized dna sequencing instrument systems and provide dna sequencing services  we cannot be certain that can successfully develop any new commercially acceptable products  increase its revenues or become profitable 
therefore we may not be able to recover our investment in if we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety  our business could be adversely affected 
our research and development efforts involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated 
if an accident occurs  we could be held liable for resulting damages  which could be substantial 
we are also subject to numerous environmental  health and workplace safety laws and regulations  including those governing laboratory procedures  exposure to blood borne pathogens and the handling of biohazardous materials 
although we maintain workers compensation insurance to cover us for costs we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of these materials  this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
due to the small amount of hazardous materials that we generate  we do not currently maintain any environmental liability or toxic tort claim insurance coverage to cover pollution conditions or other extraordinary or unanticipated events relating to our use and disposal of hazardous materials 
additional federal  state and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future 
we may incur substantial costs to comply with  and substantial fines or penalties if we violate  any of these laws or regulations 

table of contents risks related to our financial results we have a large amount of debt and our debt service obligations may prevent us from taking actions that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests 
as of december   we had total consolidated debt of million  of which million was repaid on february  and million is due in february  and for the year ended december   we had a deficiency of earnings available to cover fixed charges of million 
a variety of uncertainties and contingencies will affect our future performance  many of which are beyond our control 
we may not generate sufficient cash flow in the future to enable us to meet our anticipated fixed charges  including our debt service requirements with respect to our debt that we sold in the following table shows  as of december   the remaining aggregate amount of our interest payments due in each of the years listed in millions year aggregate interest total our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences for our future operations  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete  or placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources 
we will likely need to raise additional funding  which may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
we believe that we have sufficient capital to satisfy our funding requirements through the middle of however  our future funding requirements will depend on many factors and we anticipate that we will likely need to raise additional capital to fund our business plan and research and development efforts on a going forward basis 
to the extent that we need to obtain additional funding  the amount of additional capital we would need to raise would depend on many factors  including the number  breadth  and progress of our research  product development  and clinical programs  our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborations  the progress of our collaborators  our costs incurred in enforcing and defending our patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our products 

table of contents we expect that we would raise any additional capital we require through examination of strategic options to monetize our investment in  public or private equity offerings  debt financings  or additional collaborations and licensing arrangements 
we cannot be certain that in the future these sources of liquidity will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated 
in appropriate strategic situations  we may seek financial assistance from other sources  including contributions by others to joint ventures and other collaborative or licensing arrangements for the development and testing of products under development 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  the issuance of such securities would result in ownership dilution to our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates  or to grant licenses on unfavorable terms 
the relinquishing of rights or granting of licenses on unfavorable terms could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
if adequate funds are not available  our business  financial condition  and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
however  should we be unable to obtain future financing either through the methods described above or through other means  we may be unable to meet the critical objective of our long term business plan  which is to successfully develop and market pharmaceutical products 
if we require additional capital at a time when investment in biotechnology companies such as ours  or in the marketplace in general  is limited due to the then prevailing market or other conditions  we may not be able to raise such funds at the time that we desire or any time thereafter 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated greatly and may continue to do so 
our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly basis 
we expect that losses will continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that these fluctuations may be substantial 
our results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period  which may cause our stock price to decline and result in losses to investors 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include changes in the demand for our services  the nature  pricing  and timing of products and services provided to our collaborators and customers  our ability to compete effectively in our therapeutic discovery and development efforts against competitors that have greater financial or other resources or drug candidates that are in further stages of development  acquisition  licensing  and other costs related to the expansion of our operations  losses and expenses related to our investments  regulatory developments or changes in public perceptions relating to the use of genetic information and the diagnosis and treatment of disease based on genetic information  regulatory actions and changes related to the development of drugs  changes in intellectual property laws that affect our patent rights  payments of milestones  license fees  or research payments under the terms of our external alliances and collaborations and our ability to monitor and enforce such payments  and the timing of intellectual property licenses that we may enter 
we believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  fluctuations in quarterly results could affect the market price of our common stock in a manner unrelated to our long term operating performance 
our debt investments are impacted by the financial viability of the underlying companies 
we have a diversified portfolio of investments of which million at december  were invested in us treasuries and debt investments that are sponsored by the us government 
our corporate fixed rate debt investments comply with our policy of investing in only investment grade debt instruments 
the ability for 
table of contents the debt to be repaid upon maturity or to have a viable resale market is dependent  in part  on the financial success of the underlying company 
should the underlying company suffer significant financial difficulty  the debt instrument could either be downgraded or  in the worst case  our investment could be worthless 
this would result in our losing the cash value of the investment and incurring a charge to our statement of operations 
the market price of our common stock is highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely and may continue to do so 
for example  during fiscal year  the sale price of our stock ranged from a high of per share to a low of per share 
many factors could cause the market price of our common stock to rise and fall 
these factors include variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations  clinical results  or new products by us or our competitors  introduction of new products or new pricing policies by us or our competitors  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or others in our industry  announcement by the government or other agencies regarding the economic health of the united states and the rest of the world  the hiring or departure of key personnel  changes in market valuations of companies within the biotechnology industry  and changes in estimates of our performance or recommendations by financial analysts 
we have significant leverage as a result of the sales of our debt in in february  in connection with the sale of our convertible subordinated notes due  we incurred million of indebtedness 
in addition  in march  the initial purchasers exercised their option to purchase an additional million of convertible subordinated notes due in as a result of this indebtedness of million  our interest payment obligations amount to million per year 
the degree to which we are leveraged could adversely affect our ability to obtain further financing for working capital  acquisitions  or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend upon our future performance  which may be subject to the financial  business  and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
our convertible debt is an unsecured obligation and is not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries 
accordingly  it is effectively subordinated to all of our current and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the assets securing the indebtedness 
furthermore  our right to receive any distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon that subsidiary s liquidation  reorganization  or otherwise  is subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary  except to the extent we also are recognized as a creditor of that subsidiary 
as a result  our convertible debt is effectively subordinated to the claims of such creditors 
there are no restrictive covenants in our indentures relating to our ability to incur future indebtedness 
the indentures governing our convertible debt due in do not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payment of dividends  the incurrence of indebtedness  transactions with affiliates  incurrence of liens  or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries 
we may therefore incur additional debt  including secured indebtedness senior to these notes 

table of contents our convertible debt is the exclusive obligation of curagen corporation 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts due under the convertible debt or to provide us with funds for our payment obligations  whether by dividends  distributions  loans or other payments 
in addition  any payment of dividends  distributions  loans  or advances by our subsidiaries to us could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions 
payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries earnings and business considerations 
our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 
a higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt or that future working capital  borrowings  or equity financing will be available to pay or refinance such debt 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt  we may have to delay or curtail our research and development programs 
the level of our indebtedness among other things  could make it difficult for us to make payments on our notes  make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  or other purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete  and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business 
our ability to repurchase notes  if required  with cash upon a change in control or fundamental change may be limited 
in certain circumstances involving a fundamental change  we may be required to repurchase some or all of the notes due we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient financial resources at such time or would be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price of the notes 
our ability to repurchase the notes in such event may be limited by law  by the indenture  and by such indebtedness and agreements as may be entered into  replaced  supplemented  or amended from time to time 
securities we issue to fund our operations could cause dilution to our stockholders ownership 
we may decide to raise additional funds through a public or private debt or equity financing to fund our operations 
if we raise funds by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of current stockholders will be reduced  and the new equity securities may have rights with priority over our common stock 
we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing on terms that are favorable to us or our existing stockholders  if at all 
any conversion of our convertible debt into shares of common stock will dilute the ownership interest of our current stockholders 
the conversion price of our convertible debt due in february is approximately per share
