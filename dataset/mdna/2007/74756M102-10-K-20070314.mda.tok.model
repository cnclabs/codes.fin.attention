the following discussion includes forward looking statements 
for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ from results discussed in the forward looking statements  see forward looking statements and certain considerations contained in the introduction to this report 
overview we operate the largest dedicated bulk tank truck network in north america based on revenues as reported by bulk transporter in its annual gross revenue report 
the bulk tank truck market in north america includes all products shipped by bulk tank truck carriers and consists primarily of liquid and dry bulk chemicals which includes plastics  gasoline and related fuel products and bulk dry and liquid food grade products 
we primarily transport a broad range of chemical products and provide our customers with tank wash facilities  logistics and other value added services 
we are a core carrier for many of the fortune companies engaged in chemical processing  including the dow chemical company  procter gamble company  ei dupont and ppg industries  and we provide services to most of the top chemical producers with us operations 
our revenue is principally a function of the volume of shipments by the bulk chemical industry  the number of miles driven per load  our market share  and the allocation of shipments between tank truck transportation and other modes of transportation such as rail 
the volume of shipments of chemical products are  in turn  affected by many other industries  including consumer and industrial products  automotive  paints and coatings  and paper  and tend to vary with changing economic conditions 
our bulk service network consists primarily of independently owned third party affiliate terminals and independent owner operator drivers  supplemented by company operated terminals and trucks 
affiliates are independent companies we contract with to operate trucking terminals and tank washes exclusively on our behalf in defined markets 
the affiliates provide the capital necessary to service their contracted business and are also responsible for most of the operating costs associated with servicing the contracted business 
this relationship is governed by an extensive contract that provides  among other things  the markets and customers contracted  the revenue and cost sharing arrangement  and non competition terms 
owner operators are generally individual drivers who own or lease their tractors and agree to drive exclusively for us and or our affiliate partners 
we believe the use of affiliates and independent owner operators provides three key competitive advantages to us in the marketplace 
first  we believe that some well managed  locally owned and operated affiliate terminals can provide superior  tailored customer service 
second  affiliates and independent owner operators are paid a fixed  contractual percentage of revenue for each load they transport creating a variable cost structure that provides protection against cyclical downturns 
third  our heavy reliance on affiliates and independent owner operators creates an asset light business model by generally reducing our capital investment  as our affiliate and independent owner operators directly invest a substantial amount of the capital necessary to support the business they service 
we continually evaluate our mix of affiliate and company terminals to optimize customer service  revenue growth  profitability and return on investment 
we believe the most significant factors relevant to our future business growth are the ability to i recruit and retain drivers  ii add new customers  iii obtain additional business from existing customers  and iv continue to leverage our variable cost  asset light business model 
recent revenue growth has also been partially driven by pricing increases and we expect pricing increases to continue to positively impact our revenue growth in while a number of our customers operate their own private tank truck fleets and many of our customers source some of their logistics needs with rail  we expect our customers to continue to outsource a greater proportion of their logistic needs to full service tank truck carriers 
as a result of our leading market position  strong customer relationships  and flexible business model  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from customers seeking consolidation of their shipping relationships and those opting to outsource a greater portion of their logistic needs to third party tank truck carriers 

table of contents since september  we have implemented several major initiatives designed to enhance our operating flexibility  upgrade and standardize our business processes  improve customer service  and increase our profitability 
some of these initiatives are described below 
changed our management team 
we installed a strong senior management team  including chairman and chief executive officer gerald l 
detter  who founded and led con way trucking  president and chief operating officer gary enzor  who was previously with swift transportation  chief financial officer tim page  who was previously with perry ellis international 
greater focus on safety and training 
we have made safety the top focus of our organization 
we have developed comprehensive programs to further focus our safety procedures and benchmark us against the best in the industry 
tangible results of this focus have already manifested themselves in decreasing at fault accident frequencies in we also instituted a training program for terminal  field and headquarters personnel to augment our existing driver training 
in  we began providing extensive technical and interpersonal training to all dispatchers  terminal managers  and supervisors 
increased pricing 
due to the tight bulk transportation market in  we implemented price increases in both our bulk tank transportation business and our tank wash business 
as a result  our trucking revenue excluding fsc per billed mile increased in maximize affiliate relationships 
since january   we acquired or assisted in the transfer of several underperforming affiliates to refocus our efforts in targeted markets 
in  we terminated the affiliate arrangements with several affiliates and assumed those affiliates operations in all but one case 
we also acquired an operation from a strong affiliate  which allowed the owners of that well run  former affiliate to subsequently purchase an underperforming affiliate 
for and  these transactions resulted in the purchase of million and million  respectively of tractors  trailers and equipment and million and million  respectively of goodwill and non compete agreements 
targeted acquisitions 
in early  we acquired two transportation companies that contributed approximately million in revenue and million in operating income before interest and taxes in the total cash outlay for these acquisitions was million 
increase transportation capacity 
we and our affiliates have expanded our transportation capacity by investing in new trailers through various methods  including purchases and leases 
increase number of drivers 
in an effort to increase the number of drivers we utilize  we instituted a new program  in january  that enables drivers to become owner operators by assisting them in acquiring a tractor 
we use our credit to either lease or buy tractors from manufacturers or re sellers and then lease or sub lease them to owner operators 
the main objective of this program is to add drivers 
as of december   we currently have over active drivers in this program 
on july   we sold certain assets of ppi including accounts  customer lists and insurance contracts 
these assets were related to the business of offering insurance to individuals who are not owner operators  affiliates and fleet owners doing business regularly with us qdi persons 
for the retained business  which encompasses on going transactions with qdi persons  we entered into an outsourcing agreement  extended until  whereby the third party insurance brokerage company provides the administrative responsibilities for insurance related services offered to qdi persons 
we receive a percentage of certain commissions  underwriting profits  administrative and other defined revenues related to the outsourced administrative responsibilities for insurance related services 
we have retained certain claims of ppi including million of reserves  as of december   established on the uninsured policies identified during the investigation of irregularities at ppi 
operating results for the year ended december  include our orange juice transportation operations  which were sold in august the orange juice transportation operations generated million of revenues for the eight months ended august   and we also incurred million of start up costs and initial 
table of contents operating losses related to our entry into this business 
we also sold certain assets  primarily tractors and trailers related to the glass transportation business of levy transport  ltd  in august  these operations were not material to our operating results 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we believe the following are the more critical accounting policies that impact the financial statements  some of which are based on management s best estimates available at the time of preparation 
actual future experience may differ from these estimates 
property and equipment property and equipment expenditures  including tractor and trailer rebuilds that extend the useful lives of such equipment  are capitalized and recorded at cost 
for financial statement purposes  these assets are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets to an estimated salvage value 
annual depreciable lives are years for buildings and improvements  years for tractors and years for trailers  years for terminal equipment  years for furniture and fixtures  and years for other equipment 
tractor and trailer rebuilds  which are recurring in nature and extend the lives of the related assets  are capitalized and depreciated over the period of extension  generally to years  based on the type and extent of these rebuilds 
maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense as incurred 
management estimates the useful lives of these assets based on historical trends and the age of the assets when placed in service  and any changes in the actual lives could result in material changes in the net book value of these assets 
additionally  we estimate the salvage values of these assets based on historical sales of disposals  and any changes in the actual salvage values could also affect the net book value of these assets 
furthermore  we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in the business climate indicate that the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the related asset may be less than previously anticipated 
if the net book value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset  the carrying amount would be reduced to the present value of its expected future cash flows and an impairment loss would be recognized 
this analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions in projecting future cash flows  and changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the amount of any write offs for impairment 
goodwill goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances indicate possible impairment 
we identified three reporting units transportation operations  insurance operations and mexican operations 
we allocated goodwill to the transportation operation as it principally resulted from the acquisition of chemical leaman corporation in if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent the carrying amount of the goodwill within the reporting unit is greater than the implied fair value of goodwill 
we performed our annual assessment during the second quarter of fiscal year we used a combination of discounted cash flows and valuation of our capital structure to estimate the fair value 
projections for future cash flows were based on our recent operating trends and projected average growth rate for revenue of approximately over years 
the discount rate used to discount cash flows was based on our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 
even if our revenue projections were to decline by  we would not have an impairment of our goodwill 
if actual cash flows turn out to be significantly less than projections  then the impairment analysis could change  possibly resulting in future impairment charges 
deferred tax asset we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
if  on the basis of available evidence  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized  the asset must be reduced by a valuation allowance 

table of contents during fiscal  we released approximately million of our million deferred tax valuation allowance  due to improved operating results and the determination that it is more likely than not that expected future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize certain of our deferred tax assets 
we will evaluate the remaining million of the deferred tax valuation allowance in and if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized  we will release the remaining deferred tax valuation allowance 
to the extent that estimates of future taxable income decrease or do not materialize  potentially significant additional valuation allowances may be required 
our determinations of accounting policies are not assurances of future events 
environmental liabilities we have reserved for potential environmental liabilities based on the best estimates of potential clean up and remediation for known environmental sites 
we employ a staff of environmental professionals to administer all phases of our environmental programs and use outside experts where needed 
these professionals develop estimates of potential liabilities at these sites based on projected and known remediation costs 
these cost projections are determined through previous experiences with other sites and through bids from third party contractors 
management believes current reserves are reasonable based on current information 
accident claims reserves we currently maintain liability insurance for bodily injury and property damage claims  covering all employees  owner operators and affiliates  and workers compensation insurance coverage on our employees and company drivers 
this insurance includes deductibles of million per incident for bodily injury and property damage and million for workers compensation for periods after september  as such  we are subject to liability as a self insurer to the extent of these deductibles under the policy 
we are self insured for damage to the equipment we own or lease  and for cargo losses 
in developing liability reserves  we rely on professional third party claims administrators  insurance company estimates and the judgment of our own safety department personnel  and independent professional actuaries and attorneys 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trends in loss costs  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior year claims and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
management believes reserves are reasonable given known information  but as each case develops  estimates may change to reflect the effect of new information 
revenue recognition transportation revenues  including fuel surcharges and related costs are recognized on the date the freight is delivered 
other service revenues  consisting primarily of lease revenues from affiliates  owner operators and third parties  are recognized ratably over the lease period 
tank wash revenues are recognized when the wash is completed 
service revenues on insurance policies are recorded as a contractual percentage of premiums received ratably over the period that the insurance covers 
we have recognized all revenues on a gross basis as the principal and primary obligor with risk of loss in relation to our responsibility for completion of services as contracted by our customers 
allowance for uncollectible receivables the allowance for all potentially uncollectible receivables is based on a combination of historical data  cash payment trends  specific customer issues  write off trends  general economic conditions and other factors 
these factors are continuously monitored by our management to arrive at the estimate for the amount of accounts receivable that may be ultimately uncollectible 
the receivables analyzed include trade receivables  as well as loans and advances made to owner operators and affiliates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional allowance could be required 
absent a change in our collection efforts  a million increase in our receivables aged less than days resulting from transportation billings would increase our allowance for uncollectible receivables by less than million 
stock compensation plans stock compensation for our stock option plan is determined by the assumptions required under sfas r  which includes  volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate  dividend rate and expected forfeiture rate 
the total stock compensation that is expected to be recognized over the life of the  options issued in january and the  options issued in may is million 
if the 
table of contents expected life of the options were to increase from years to years  then the total compensation would increase to million 
if our risk free interest rate were to increase by point  then the total compensation would stay constant at approximately million 
if our volatility rate were to increase by point  then the total compensation would stay constant at approximately million 
pension plans we maintain two noncontributory defined benefit plans resulting from a prior acquisition that cover certain full time salaried employees and certain other employees under a collective bargaining agreement 
both plans are frozen and  as such  no future benefits accrue 
we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by gaap  which include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates to and assumed rates of return to depending on the pension plan 
material changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
future annual amounts could be impacted by changes in the discount rate  changes in the expected long term rate of return  changes in the level of contributions to the plans and other factors 
the discount rate is based on a model portfolio of aa rated bonds with a maturity matched to the estimated payouts of future pension benefits 
the expected return on plan assets is based on our expectation of the long term rates of return on each asset class based on the current asset mix of the funds  considering the historical returns earned on the type of assets in the funds  plus an assumption of future inflation 
the current investment policy target asset allocation differs between our two plans  but it is between to for equities and to for bonds  and the current inflation assumption is 
we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
as required by gaap in the united states  the effects of the modifications are amortized over future periods 
based on the information provided by our independent actuaries and other relevant sources  we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable 
assumed discount rates and expected return on plan assets have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the pension plan 
at december   our projected benefit obligation pbo was million 
our projected net periodic pension expense is  a decrease in our assumed discount rate would increase our pbo to million and decrease our net periodic pension expense to  a increase in our assumed discount rate would decrease our pbo to million and increase our net periodic pension expense to  a decrease in our assumed rate of return would not change our pbo but would increase our net periodic pension expense to  a increase in our assumed rate of return would not change our pbo but would decrease our net periodic pension expense to a credit of  new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin which clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we are in the process of analyzing the january adoption of fin in order to determine its effects  if any  on our financial position  results of operations or cashflows 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas are effective for the fiscal year beginning january  we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of sfas on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in october  the fasb issued sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas 
sfas changed the accounting rules for reporting and disclosures related to pensions and other postretirement 
table of contents benefit plans 
this change was effective for our fiscal year ending december  the adoption of sfas required us to reclassify million of a pension intangible asset into accumulated other comprehensive loss within our shareholders equity 
in september  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  to address diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements 
sab provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab is effective for our year ended december   and allows a one time transitional cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of january  for errors that were not previously deemed material  but are material under the guidance in sab the adoption of sab did not have any impact on our financial position  results of operations or cashflows

excludes and tractors held as inventory for sale as of december  and  respectively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues for were million  an increase of million or  compared to revenues 
transportation revenue increased by million or compared to the increase in transportation revenue is primarily attributable to rate increases and an increase in the number of miles driven offset in part by a reduction in the total number of loads from the prior year 
the decreased load count was spread across most of our customer base 
other service revenue decreased by million or in versus this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in rental revenues resulting from reduced trailer rental revenue generated from our affiliates  partially offset by a million increase in revenues at our qsi subsidiary 
fuel surcharge revenue increased million from as a result of higher average fuel prices and an increase in the number of miles driven during the year 
approximately of the fuel surcharge revenue is reflected in purchased transportation and was paid to our affiliates and company owner operators during fiscal year while the remaining company costs offset by the fuel surcharge are reflected in fuels  supplies and maintenance 
we managed a total of approximately  trailers and  tractors at the end of compared to trailers and  tractors at december  the increase in trailers is primarily due to our purchase or lease of additional trailers during fiscal year the increase in tractors is partially the result of acquiring affiliates and new businesses and expanding the number of owner operators through our tractor lease program 
we expect to either purchase or lease additional tractors and trailers in operating expenses totaled million in  an increase of million or from the increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to a million increase in purchased transportation  a million increase in fuels  supplies and maintenance and a million increase in compensation 
the increase over the prior year in purchased transportation is primarily due to a majority of the million of additional fuel surcharges being passed through to our affiliates and owner operators offset in part by a shift of our transportation business from affiliates to more company operations 
we pay our affiliates approximately of the transportation revenue while we pay company owner operators approximately of the transportation revenue 
since we pay our affiliates a greater percentage of revenues generated by them than is paid to company owner operators  our purchased transportation costs will decrease more as revenues generated by affiliates decrease as a percentage of total transportation revenue 
our affiliates generated of our transportation and fuel surcharge revenue in compared to for the prior year 
total purchased transportation as a percentage of transportation revenue and fuel surcharge revenue decreased to versus for the prior year due to this shift in our revenue mix 
compensation expense increased million  or primarily due to new or converted company terminals added over the prior year  company wide compensation increases and an increase in stock based compensation expense offset in part by decreases from the prior year for pension  severance and hiring costs for 
table of contents senior executives 
the increase in stock based compensation expense is due in part to the implementation of sfas r on january  fuel  supplies and maintenance increased million or due primarily to fuel costs associated with the shift of revenue from affiliates to company owned terminals  increased lease costs as we fund the expansion of our trailer fleet through the use of operating leases  costs associated with the purchase of tires as we expand our fleet and an increase in the number of miles driven  increased maintenance as we increase the capacity of our equipment and increased cleaning of our trailers 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  due primarily to the sale of tractors in the prior year and the use of more leased trailers versus purchasing trailers as well as a number of assets becoming fully depreciated throughout and selling and administrative expenses increased million  or 
this increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in environmental costs associated with the bridgeport  nj location and our william dick  pa location and epa oversight charges assessed due to a recent court decision offset by cost reductions at various smaller sites  an increase in travel costs as we add more company operations in addition to increased driver recruitment costs and increased building rental and maintenance costs associated with corporate and terminal buildings 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in professional fees from the prior year for tax  accounting and legal issues that did not recur in and a million decrease in bad debt expense arising from improved collection efforts 
insurance expense decreased million  or  due primarily to an improvement in our loss experience in and a refinement in our projection from our claims model through the use of more specific industry data and the recognition of early settlement claims offset in part by million of cleanup costs related to a chemical release at one of our tank wash facilities 
during  we received million of insurance reimbursement funds 
during  we received million of insurance reimbursement funds and reversed million of fines and penalties related to our insurance subsidiary that was initially recorded in the fourth quarter of gain on disposal of property and equipment was million in fiscal year as compared to a loss of million in fiscal year  primarily due to the sale of several real properties that generated million of gain with the remaining net gain generated from the sale of tractors and trailers

in the first quarter of  we wrote off million of debt issuance costs associated with the million partial repayment of our term loan using proceeds from the issuance of new debt in january other income decreased by million due primarily to a million charge for expenses related to the filing of a shelf registration statement and expenses for potentially issuing new shares and reduced foreign currency transaction exchange gain in versus the benefit for income taxes was million in as compared to a provision for income taxes of million in this change was primarily due to the release of approximately million of our 
table of contents million deferred tax valuation allowance 
this release is due to improved operating results and the determination that it is more likely than not that expected future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize certain of our deferred tax assets 
net income was million for versus million for for the reasons outlined above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues for were million  an increase of million or  compared to revenues of approximately million 
transportation revenue increased by million or compared to the increase is primarily attributable to a rate increase and an increase in the number of drivers offset in part by a reduction in the total number of loads from the prior year 
the total number of miles was down slightly from the prior year 
the decreased load count was spread across our entire customer base 
other service revenue decreased by million or in versus this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in revenues at our ppi subsidiary resulting from lower premium revenues after the sale of certain assets by ppi  a million decrease in revenues at our qsi subsidiary and a million decrease in tractor  trailer and other rental revenues 
fuel surcharge revenue increased million from as a result of higher fuel prices and volume increases 
we operated a total of approximately  trailers and  tractors at the end of compared to  trailers and  tractors at december  the increase in trailers is primarily due to our purchase of new trailers during fiscal year while tractors and trailers of affiliates and owner operators remained relatively constant 
operating expenses totaled million in  an increase of million or from the increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to the million increase in purchased transportation resulting from increased fuel surcharges passed through to our affiliates and owner operators 
we pay our affiliates approximately of the transportation revenue while we pay owner operators approximately of transportation revenue 
since we pay our affiliates a greater percentage of revenues generated by them than is paid to company owner operators  our purchased transportation costs will increase more as revenues generated by affiliates increase as a percentage of total transportation revenue 
our affiliates generated of our transportation and fuel surcharge revenue in compared to for the prior year 
total purchased transportation as a percentage of transportation revenue and fuel surcharge revenue increased to versus for the prior year 
approximately of the fuel surcharge revenue is reflected in purchased transportation and was paid to our affiliates and owner operators during fiscal year while the remaining fuel surcharge is reflected in fuels  supplies and maintenance 
compensation expense increased million  or primarily due to the costs associated with transitioning to our new chief executive officer and management changes at our tank wash business  increased costs associated with the issuance of restricted stock since december  increases resulting from the addition of new senior management and incentive plans offset in part by decreases in payroll arising from the sale of certain assets of ppi and the levy glass division during the third quarter of fuel  supplies and maintenance increased million or due primarily to rising energy prices and increased maintenance costs offset in part by a decrease in costs associated with the sale of the glass business of the levy subsidiary 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  due primarily to certain trailers being transferred to held for sale in  which halts depreciation on those assets  as well as a number of assets becoming fully depreciated throughout and selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or 
this decrease is primarily attributable to a million charge incurred in the period for environmental costs associated with the william dick  pa site versus a current year net charge of million in environmental costs arising from

insurance expense decreased million  or  due primarily to a million increase in reimbursements for a fire that occurred in a prior year and reduced adverse developments during the year for major claims 
in fiscal year  we reversed million of fines and penalties that were accrued in fiscal year due to the pending closure of such issues 
loss on disposal of property and equipment decreased million in fiscal year primarily due to the sale of the levy glass division occurring in fiscal year impairment loss on property and equipment were million and million in fiscal years and  respectively

operating income increased million or compared to the operating margin for was compared to for as a result of the above items 
interest expense increased by million or in compared to as a result of higher libor rates and the issuance in january of new debt with higher overall interest rates which includes debt issuance costs as a component of interest expense but with extended maturity dates

net income was million for versus a net loss of million for for the reasons outlined above 
exchange rates we operate in canada and mexico as well as in the united states 
our results of operations are affected by the relative strength of currencies in the countries where we operate 
approximately  and of our revenue in fiscal year  and  respectively  was generated outside the united states 
in comparing the average exchange rates between fiscal and the year ago period  the canadian dollar appreciated against the united states dollar by approximately while the mexican peso depreciated against the united states dollar by approximately 
the change in exchange rates positively impacted revenue by approximately million 
the appreciation of the canadian dollar since december  was the primary reason for the less than million increase in cumulative currency translation loss in shareholders equity for fiscal year gains and losses included in the consolidated statements of operations from foreign currency transactions included a million gain in fiscal year  a million gain in fiscal year  and a million loss in fiscal year risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations are discussed further in item a

we incur capital expenditures for the purpose of purchasing tractors and trailers to meet our strategic needs during the year  and maintaining and improving our infrastructure 
during  we reduced our capital expenditures required for our tractor and trailer acquisitions by entering into operating leases which will result in increased operating expenses in future periods 
we plan to continue to enter into operating leases to reduce capital expenditures in we have accrued million for environmental claims and million for loss and damage claims and the timing of the cash payment for such claims fluctuates from quarter to quarter 
we generated million  million and million from operating activities in  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in as compared to is primarily due to improved profitability  continued improvement of our accounts receivable collection efforts offset by funds used to purchase tractors for resale to drivers and to fund the tractor sales as a note receivable to us

we believe that  based on current operations and anticipated growth  our cash flow from operations  together with available sources of liquidity  including borrowings under the revolver  will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures  make required payments of principal and interest on our debt  including obligations under our credit agreement  and satisfy other long term contractual commitments for the next twelve months 
however  for periods extending beyond twelve months  if our operating cash flow and borrowings under the revolving credit facility are not sufficient to satisfy our capital expenditures  debt service and other long term contractual commitments  we would be required to seek alternative financing 
these alternatives would likely include another restructuring or refinancing of our long term debt  the sale of a portion or all of our assets or operations  or the sale of additional debt or equity securities 
if these alternatives were not available in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms  or were not permitted under our existing agreements  we might default on some or all of our obligations 
if we default on our obligations  including our financial covenants required to be maintained under the credit facility  and the debt under the indentures for the new notes were to be accelerated  our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full all of our indebtedness  and we might be forced into bankruptcy 
other issues we have historically sought to acquire smaller local operators as part of our program of strategic growth 
we continue to evaluate potential accretive acquisitions in order to capitalize on the consolidation occurring in the industry and expect to fund such acquisitions from available sources of liquidity  including borrowings under the revolver 
while uncertainties relating to environmental  labor and other regulatory matters exist within the trucking industry  management is not aware of any trends or events likely to have a material adverse effect on liquidity or the accompanying financial statements 
our credit rating is affected by many factors  including our financial results  operating cash flows and total indebtedness 

table of contents as a holding company with no significant assets other than ownership of of qd llc s membership units  qdi also depends upon qd llc s cash flows to service our debt 
qd llc s ability to make distributions to qdi is restricted by the covenants contained in the revolving credit facility and the indentures governing the notes 
however  apollo as our controlling shareholder may have an interest in pursuing reorganizations  restructurings or other transactions involving us that  in their judgment  could enhance their equity investment even though those transactions might involve increasing qd llc s leverage or impairing qd llc s creditworthiness in order to decrease qdi s leverage 
while the restrictions in the revolving credit facility cover a wide variety of arrangements that have traditionally been used to effect highly leveraged transactions  the revolving credit facility and the indentures may not afford the holders of our debt protection in all circumstances from the adverse aspects of a highly leveraged transaction  reorganization  restructuring  merger or similar transaction 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risks from i interest rates due to our variable interest rate indebtedness  ii foreign currency fluctuations due to our international operations and iii increased commodity prices due to the diesel consumption necessary for our operations 
during the last three years  we have not held derivative instruments or engaged in other hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to such risks 
interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our variable rate borrowings under qd llc s credit facility 
interest rates for the revolver are based  at qd llc s option  on either the administrative agent s base rate plus or upon the eurodollar rate plus  and interest rates for the term loan are based  at qd llc s option  upon the administrative agent s base rate plus or upon the eurodollar rate plus  in each case subject to reductions in the applicable margins for the revolver and term loan only if we reduce our total consolidated leverage below certain levels 
the base rate for the revolver is equal to the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds overnight rate plus 
the base rate for our senior floating rate notes is libor plus 
balance at december  interest rate at december  effect of change in s in s term loan revolver senior floating rate notes total at december   a point increase in the current per annum interest rate for each would result in million of additional interest expense during the next year 
the foregoing calculation assumes an instantaneous one percentage point increase in the rates of all of our indebtedness and that the principal amount of each is the amount outstanding as of december  the calculation therefore does not account for the differences in the market rates upon which the interest rates of our indebtedness is based  our various options to elect the lower of two different interest rates under our borrowings or other possible actions  such as prepayment  that we might take in response to any rate increase 
foreign currency exchange rate risk operating in international markets involves exposure to the possibility of volatile movements in foreign exchange rates 
the currencies in each of the countries in which we operate affect the results of our international operations reported in united states dollars  and the value of the net assets of our international operations reported in united states dollars 

table of contents these exposures may impact future earnings or cash flows 
revenue from foreign locations canada and mexico represented approximately of our consolidated revenue in and of our consolidated revenue in the economic impact of foreign exchange rate movements is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
therefore  to isolate the effect of changes in currency does not accurately portray the effect of these other important economic factors 
as foreign exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of our international subsidiaries into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
while we may hedge specific transaction risks  we generally do not hedge translation risks because we believe there is no long term economic benefit in doing so 
assets and liabilities for our canadian operations are matched in the local currency  which reduces the need for dollar conversion 
our mexican operations use the united states dollar as their functional currency 
any foreign currency impact on translating assets and liabilities into dollars is included as a component of shareholders equity 
our revenue results for fiscal year were positively impacted by a million foreign currency movement  primarily due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
changes in foreign exchange rates that had the largest impact on translating our international operating profits for related to the canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
we estimate that a adverse change in the canadian dollar foreign exchange rate would have decreased our revenues by approximately million in  assuming no changes other than the exchange rate itself 
our inter company loans are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates primarily between the united states dollar and the canadian dollar 
based on the outstanding balance of our inter company loans at december   a change of in the exchange rate for the canadian dollar would cause a change in our foreign exchange result of less than million 
commodity price risk the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production  seasonality  weather  global politics and other market factors 
in  diesel fuel prices rose to near record levels 
historically  we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
the price and availability of diesel fuel can be unpredictable as well as the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases 
in and  a majority of fuel price fluctuations were covered through fuel surcharges
