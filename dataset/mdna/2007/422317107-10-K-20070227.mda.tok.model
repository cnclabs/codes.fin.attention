executive summary hearst argyle television  inc and its subsidiaries hereafter we or the company own and operate network affiliated television stations 
additionally  we provide management services to two network affiliated stations and one independent television station and two radio stations owned by the hearst corporation hearst in exchange for management fees 
we are a leader in the convergence of local broadcast television and the internet through our investment in  and operating agreement with  internet broadcasting  which operates a nation wide network of television websites 
our stations websites typically provide news  weather  community information  user generated content and entertainment content to our audience 
also  of our stations broadcast additional channels on a multicast stream with their main digital channel 
events and other factors that have influenced our results for the year ended december   total revenue increased 
results for the year ended reflect record political revenue in a mid term election year  the positive impact of strategic developments including the successful completion of certain retransmission consent negotiations and a station acquisition  and expanded focus on digital media 
these results were offset by the dampening impact of weak automotive advertising 
on august   the company purchased the assets related to broadcast television station wkcf tv  the cw affiliate in orlando  florida  for million in cash funded with a combination of cash on hand and a million advance under the company s credit facility 
for the year ended december   the company recorded digital media revenue and associated expenses of million and million  respectively 
this is primarily due to the restructuring of our relationship with internet broadcasting and ibs hatv llc which increased our equity interest in internet broadcasting to and dissolved ibs hatv llc 
as of january   we now recognize results of local websites directly in our income statement 
as a result of the adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r as of january   the company recognized stock based compensation expense of million in the year ended december  in  we recognized insurance proceeds of million for a portion of the property damages and expenses incurred at our station wdsu tv in new orleans  louisiana as a result of hurricane katrina 
of this amount  million offset a receivable from our property insurers established in while the remaining million was recorded as an offset to salaries  benefits and other operating costs 
additional recoveries are expected in future periods 
the company wrote off its investment of million in usdtv which filed for bankruptcy in july at december   total debt was million  unchanged from december  industry trends political advertising increases in even numbered years  such as  consistent with the increase in the number of candidates running for political office in the interim national election cycle  as well as select state and local elections 
revenue from olympic advertising occurs exclusively in even numbered years  such as  with the alternating winter and summer games occurring every two years 
our nbc stations aired the winter olympics in february the federal communications commission fcc has permitted broadcast television station licensees to use their digital spectrum for a wide variety of services such as high definition television programming  audio  data and other types of communication  subject to the requirement that each broadcaster provide at least one free video channel equal in quality to the current technical standards 
our nbc stations currently broadcast the weather plus network  a local and national weather broadcast network  on a multicast stream in addition to their main digital channels 
in addition  two of our other stations launched similar station branded multicast weather channels in compensation from networks to their affiliates in exchange for broadcasting of network programming has been sharply reduced in recent years and may be eliminated in the future 
pursuant to the cable television consumer protection and competition act of cable act and the fcc s must carry regulations  cable operators are generally required to devote up to one third of their activated channel capacity to the carriage of the analog signal of local commercial television stations 
on a cable system by cable system basis  a local television broadcast station must choose once every three years whether to waive the right to mandatory  but uncompensated  carriage and  instead  to negotiate a grant of retransmission consent 
we opted to negotiate retransmission consent with most of the cable systems that carry our stations and we record income from most of these relationships 
the satellite home viewer improvement act of shvia established a compulsory copyright licensing system for the distribution of local television station signals by direct broadcast satellite systems to viewers in each dma 
under shvia s carry one  carry all provision  a direct broadcast satellite system generally is required to retransmit the analog signal of all local television stations in a dma if the system chooses to retransmit the analog signal of any local television station in that dma 
television stations located in markets in which satellite carriage of local stations is offered may elect mandatory carriage or retransmission consent once every three years 
we opted to negotiate retransmission consent for all satellite systems that carry our stations and we record income from most of these relationship 
legislation that guides the transition from analog to digital television broadcasting includes a deadline of february  for completion of the transition to digital broadcasting and the return of the analog spectrum to the government 
as a result  the company accelerated the depreciation of certain equipment that may have a shorter useful life as a result of the digital conversion 
in nextel was granted the right from the fcc to reclaim from broadcasters in each market across the country the ghz spectrum to use for an emergency communications system 
in order to claim this signal  nextel must replace all analog equipment currently using this spectrum with digital equipment 
all broadcasters have agreed to use the digital substitute that nextel will provide 
the transition will be completed on a market by market basis beginning in as the transition takes place in each market  we expect to record gains to the extent that the fair market value of the equipment we receive exceeds the book value of the analog equipment 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  program rights  barter and trade transactions  useful lives of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  carrying value of investments  accrued liabilities  contingent liabilities  income taxes  pension benefits  and fair value of financial instruments and stock options 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
had we used different assumptions in determining our estimates  our reported results may have varied 
the different types of estimates that are required to be made by us in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements vary significantly in the level of subjectivity involved in their determination 
we have identified the estimates below as those which contain a relatively high level of subjectivity in their determination and  therefore  could have a more material effect upon our reported results if different assumptions were used 
impairment testing of intangible assets in performing our annual impairment testing of goodwill and fcc licenses  which are both considered to be intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  we must make a significant number of assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value based on the present value of future cash flows 
to assist in this process  we utilize the services of an independent valuation consulting firm 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the assumptions and estimates required under the impairment testing of goodwill and fcc licenses include future market revenue growth  operating profit margins  perpetual growth rates  market revenue share  and weighted average cost of capital  among others 
for the year ended december   estimates of the present value of future cash flows for our stations exceeded the book value of our fcc licenses and goodwill indicating no impairment of these assets 
for the year ended december   estimates of future cash flows for our station in new orleans were reduced significantly from prior year due to the negative impact of hurricane katrina on the new orleans market 
as a result  the company wrote down its book value of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill by million  which was comprised of million of fcc license and million of goodwill 
pension assumptions in computing projected benefit obligations and the resulting pension expense  we are required to make a number of assumptions 
to assist in this process  we use the services of an independent consulting firm 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
to compute our projected benefit obligations as of the measurement date of september   we used the discount rate of and an average rate of compensation increase of 
in determining the discount rate assumption of  we used a measurement date of september  and constructed a portfolio of bonds to match the benefit payment stream that is projected to be paid from the company s pension plans 
the benefit payment stream is assumed to be funded from bond coupons and maturities as well as interest on the excess cash flows from the bond portfolio 
to compute our pension expense in the year ended december   we assumed a discount rate of  an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of  and an average rate of compensation increase of 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on management s methodology for developing the expected long term rate of return assumption 
we consider the assumptions used in our determination of our projected benefit obligations and pension expense to be reasonable 
pension assumptions sensitivity analysis the weighted average assumptions used in computing our net pension expense and projected benefit obligation have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a one percentage point change in each of the assumptions below would have the following effects upon net pension expense and projected benefit obligation  respectively  in the year ended and as of december  one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease discount rate expected long term rate of return rate of compensation increase discount rate expected long term rate of return rate of compensation increase in thousands net pension benefit expense projected benefit obligation n a n a income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the differences in the book and tax bases of certain assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not  that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
income tax expense was million or of pre tax income in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  deferred tax assets were approximately million and deferred tax liabilities were approximately million as of december  our estimates of income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates reflect our assessment of future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the consolidated financial statements  giving consideration to both timing and probability 
actual income taxes could vary from such estimates as a result of future changes in income tax law or reviews by the internal revenue service or other tax authorities 
investment carrying values we have investments in unconsolidated affiliates  which are accounted for under the equity method if our equity interest is from to  and under the cost method if our equity interest is less than and we do not exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies 
we review the carrying value of investments on an ongoing basis and adjust them to reflect net realizable value  where necessary 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as part of our analysis and determination of the net realizable value of investments  we must make assumptions and estimates regarding expected future cash flows  which involve assessing the financial results  forecasts  and strategic direction of each company 
during the year ended december   the company wrote off its investment of million in usdtv 
in december  nbc and the company concluded the nbc hearst argyle syndication  llc joint venture and as a result  the company recorded a loss of million 
during the year ended december   the company recorded a million write down to net realizable value of the company s investment in proact technologies corporation 
we consider the assumptions used in our determination of investment carrying values to be reasonable
