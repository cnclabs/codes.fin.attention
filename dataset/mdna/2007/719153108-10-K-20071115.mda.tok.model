fiscal year overview the fiscal year ended september  was the first full fiscal year of the company s operations since the arrival of the company s new management team led by president and chief executive officer  woody hobbs 
the company s results for the fiscal year ended september  reflect the continuing implementation of new strategic and tactical plans developed under this new leadership team 
under these plans  the company has implemented substantial changes to its business  including significant changes to sales practices and pricing policies intended to stabilize the company s revenue from its css business and to enhance overall operating margins 
this was also the first full fiscal year to reflect the company s previous decisions to discontinue the marketing and sale of enterprise application software products and to cease the use of fully paid up licenses in its css business  and to rely instead on volume purchase license agreements vpas and pay as you go consumption based license arrangements 
fully paid up licenses had accounted for over of the company s total revenue in fiscal year and accounted for no revenue in fiscal year during fiscal year  company management took several steps which succeeded in restoring recurring revenues from certain major customers who had previously had the benefit of fully paid up licenses 
principally as a result of these initiatives  the company s revenue for the second half of fiscal year was more than higher than its revenue for the first half of the fiscal year 
during fiscal year  management also took significant steps to reduce overall operating costs and to drive higher efficiencies throughout the company 
these steps included implementing restructuring decisions made in both the first and fourth fiscal quarters as well as completing the implementation of restructuring decisions announced during the second half of fiscal year the company s total workforce decreased  from employees at september  to employees as of september   however  total expenditures including cost of goods and operating expenses were reduced by approximately as other cost management initiatives  including those launched in previous periods took their full effect 
the company s reported revenues for the fiscal year ended september  reflect a conclusion it reached in april that it would no longer be appropriate to rely on customer forecasts of consumption of the company s products when reporting revenue from vpas and other similar agreements 
the company based this decision on a detailed analysis of the reliability of such customer forecasts when compared to subsequently received reports of actual consumption of its products 
for periods ended on or before december   the company recognized revenues from vpas for units estimated to be consumed by the end of the following quarter  provided the customer had been invoiced for such consumption prior to the end of the current quarter and provided all other revenue recognition criteria had been met 
these estimates had historically been recorded based on customer forecasts 
actual consumption that was subsequently reported by these same customers was regularly compared to the previous estimates to confirm the reliability of this method of determining projected consumption 
the company s examination of reports received from its customers during april regarding their actual consumption of its products during the three month period ended march   and a comparison of those consumption reports to forecasts previously provided by these customers  led the company to the view that customer forecasts were no longer a reliable indicator of future consumption 
since the company no longer considered the associated revenue to be reliably determinable  it was no longer appropriate to include future period consumption in current period revenue 
as a result  no revenue associated with consumption of products that is forecasted to occur in future periods has been included in revenue for any quarter ending after december  overall total revenue for the fiscal year ended september  decreased to million  from million a decrease in the fiscal year ended september  this decrease in revenue was principally attributable to the company s previous practice of selling fully paid up licenses 
fully paid up licenses gave customers unlimited distribution rights of the applicable product over a specific time period or with respect to a specific customer device 
in connection with paid up licenses  the company 
table of contents recognized all license fees upon execution of the agreement  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria had been met 
paid up license agreements may have had the effect of accelerating revenue into the quarter in which the agreement was executed and thereby decreasing recurring revenues in subsequent periods 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  the company began changing its licensing practices away from heavy reliance on paid up licenses to i vpas for large customers and ii pay as you go consumption based license arrangements for smaller customers 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company completely ceased entering into paid up licenses with its customers  and converted to the use of only vpas and pay as you go consumption based license arrangements 
the company s revenues for the fiscal year ended september  included revenues from certain customers who had entered into fully paid up licenses in prior periods but who  as a result of the specific terms of those contracts  were no longer authorized to continue to deploy the products covered by those licenses 
additionally  certain customers who had previously had the benefit of fully paid up licenses entered into new licensing agreements as a result of deploying newer versions of the company s products which were not covered by the fully paid up licenses 
gross margins for fiscal year were million  a decrease from gross margins of million in fiscal year this decrease resulted from the revenue decline described above offset by i a reduction of license costs associated with discontinued enterprise application products  ii a reduction of service costs that resulted from the cost management initiatives described above  and iii a reduction in the amortization of purchased technology 
operating expenses for fiscal year were million  a reduction of from million for fiscal year this reduction was principally associated with restructuring initiatives announced during the second half of fiscal year and the further cost reductions undertaken during the first half of fiscal year the company incurred a net loss of million for fiscal year  compared to a net loss of million for fiscal year this million decrease in net loss was principally the result of a million reduction in net revenue being offset by the effects of cost control initiatives implemented by the new management team  which generated an million reduction in cost of revenues and a million reduction in operating expenses

the increase in other license fees was attributable to higher revenues from vpas  which typically included higher per unit prices than the company had achieved in earlier periods 
in fiscal year  the company executed vpa transactions with certain of its customers with payment terms spread over periods of generally nine to twelve months 
consistent with our policy  only fees due within days are invoiced and recorded as revenue or deferred revenue 
vpa fees due beyond days are not invoiced or recorded by the company 
as of the end of fiscal year  the total amount which had not been recorded by the company from all of its vpa agreements was approximately million 
the company expects to invoice and recognize this million as revenue over future periods  however  uncertainties such as the timing of customer utilization of our products may impact the timing of invoicing and recognizing this revenue 
as a percentage of total revenue  license fees were for fiscal year versus in fiscal year this decrease is principally attributable to the sale of fully paid up licenses in fiscal year and the growth in service fees discussed below 
service fees for fiscal year were million  an increase of million  or  from million for fiscal year as a percentage of total revenue  service fees were in fiscal year versus for fiscal year the increase in service fees was principally a result of a large engineering contract signed with a single customer as well as overall price increases for engineering and support services  while the increase in service fees as a percentage of total revenue was principally a result of the increased service fee revenues and the sale of fully paid up licenses in the earlier period 

table of contents license fees for fiscal year were million  a decrease of from revenues of million in fiscal year service revenues for fiscal year were million  an increase of from revenues of million in fiscal year total revenues for fiscal year decreased by million  or  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year a substantial portion of the decline occurred in the second half of fiscal year  when revenues were only million  down from million in the second half of fiscal year and from million for the first half of fiscal year the decrease in revenues was partially attributable to the effect of the company having sold increasing proportions of its products through the use of fully paid up licenses during fiscal years and and the first half of fiscal year  which may have reduced our revenues in subsequent periods 
total paid up license revenue for all sectors represented of total revenues or million in fiscal year and of total revenues or million in the first half of fiscal year during the third quarter of fiscal year  we began changing our licensing practices away from heavy reliance on paid up licenses to volume purchase agreements for large customers and pay as you go consumption based arrangements for smaller customers

service costs include personnel related expenses such as salaries and other related costs associated with work performed under professional service contracts  non recurring engineering agreements and post sales customer support costs 
license costs tend to be variable and based on specific product revenues 
service costs tend to be fixed but can fluctuate with changes in revenue levels

cost of service revenues decreased by million primarily as a result of staffing reductions associated with this new product strategy 
amortization of purchased technology was lower by million in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  primarily as a result of accelerated intellectual property amortization in fiscal year as well as certain intellectual property assets becoming fully amortized

revenue recognition 
we license software under non cancelable license agreements and provide services including non recurring engineering efforts  maintenance consisting of product support services and rights to unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis  and training 
in many cases  and in all cases with respect to our css products  our software products are incorporated into the products of our oem and odm customers 
revenues from software license agreements are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for each undelivered element 
vsoe of fair value is generally the price charged when that element is sold separately or  for items not yet being sold  it is the price established by management that will not change before the introduction of the item into the marketplace 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered element s is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenues 
if vsoe of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  revenues are deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 
revenue from arrangements  including rights to unspecified future products  is recognized ratably over the term of the respective agreement 
the company recognizes revenue related to delivered products or services only if the above revenue recognition criteria are met  any undelivered products or services are not essential to the functionality of the 
table of contents delivered products and services  and payment for the delivered products or services is not contingent upon delivery of the remaining products or services 
license revenues from oems and odms are generally recognized in each period based on estimated consumption by the oems and odms of our software products or products containing our software  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
under pay as you go consumption based arrangements  we normally recognize revenue for all consumption prior to the end of the accounting period 
since we generally receive quarterly royalty reports from our oems and odms approximately to days following the end of the quarter  we have put processes in place to reasonably estimate the license revenues  including obtaining estimates of production from our oem and odm customers  utilizing historical experience  and using other relevant current information 
based on our estimates  we recognized million and million of license revenues from consumption based arrangements with our oem and odm customers for the period ending september  and september   respectively 
to date  the variances between estimated and actual revenues have been immaterial 
for periods ended on or before december   the company recognized revenues from vpas for units estimated to be consumed by the end of the following quarter  provided the customer has been invoiced for such consumption prior to the end of the current quarter and provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
these estimates had historically been recorded based on customer forecasts 
actual consumption that was subsequently reported by these same customers was regularly compared to the previous estimates to confirm the reliability of this method of determining projected consumption 
the company s examination of reports received from its customers during april regarding actual consumption of the company s products during the three month period ended march  and a comparison of those consumption reports to forecasts previously provided by these customers  led the company to the view that customer forecasts were no longer a reliable indicator of future consumption 
since the company no longer considered the customer forecast to be a reliable estimate of future consumption  it was no longer appropriate to include future period consumption in current period revenue 
as a result of this determination  beginning with the three month period ended march   for vpas with oems and odms  the company began to recognize license revenues only for units consumed by the end of the current accounting quarter  to the extent that the customer has been invoiced for such consumption prior to the end of the current quarter and provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if the agreement provides that the right to consume units lapses at the end of the term of the vpa  the company recognizes royalty revenues ratably over the term of the vpa if such amount is higher than that determined based on actual consumption by the end of the current accounting quarter 
amounts that have been invoiced under the vpa s and relate to consumption beyond the current accounting quarter are recorded as deferred revenue 
during an accounting period  deferred revenues increase or decrease primarily to the extent that the dollar amount of new vpas entered into during the period is greater or less than the revenue that is recognized during the period from those agreements and the outstanding deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period 
we believe that virtually all deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue within the next months 
the company has also entered into software license agreements referred to as paid up licenses and had relied heavily on their use during fiscal years and generally  we recognized all license revenues under paid up license agreements upon execution of the agreement provided that all revenue recognition criteria were met 
total paid up license revenue represented million  or  of total revenues in fiscal year compared to million or of total revenues in fiscal year during the third quarter of fiscal year  we began changing our licensing practices away from paid up licenses to volume purchase agreements for large customers and pay as you go consumption based arrangements with smaller customers 
effective september  we ended the use of paid up licenses 
in addition  we may execute multiple contracts amendments with the same customer several times throughout a year 
these contracts are reviewed to determine if they are linked and should be evaluated as one deal 
the review includes consideration of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop and technical 
table of contents practice aid  software revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements tpa  and the standard historical business practice of our company 
allowances for accounts receivable 
provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded in general and administrative expenses 
at september  and  the allowance was million and million  respectively 
these estimates are based on our assessment of the probable collection from specific customer accounts  the aging of the accounts receivable  historical revenue variances  analysis of credit memo data  bad debt write offs  and other known factors 
if economic or specific industry trends worsen beyond our estimates  or if there is a deterioration of our major customers credit worthiness  or actual defaults are higher than our estimates based on historical experience  we would increase the allowance which would impact our results of operations 
intangible assets 
intangible assets include prepaid royalties  purchased technologies  goodwill and other intangibles 
at september  and  these assets  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million and million  respectively 
prepaid royalties represent payments to several third party technology partners for their software that is incorporated into certain of our products 
all other intangible assets were derived from our acquisitions 
the cost of the acquisitions is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired  including intangible assets based on their respective estimated fair value at the date of acquisition  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
the useful life of the intangible assets was estimated based on the period over which the assets were expected to contribute directly and indirectly to the future cash flows 
if assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
accordingly  the allocation of the acquisition cost to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on our future operating results 
the original recorded values of intangible assets and goodwill are based on third party appraisals 
the allocation process requires the extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement for the acquisition of intangible assets from xtool mobile security  inc xtool in august  we paid million to xtool 
the purchase agreement includes two contingent amounts of  each to be paid upon the company reaching certain milestones as of december  and june  in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement for the acquisition of integrity science  inc isi in february  contingent consideration of million was to be paid out in equal annual increments beginning in fiscal year  provided that the developed technology purchased as part of the original business combination was still utilized within products at the annual milestone dates 
for each year between fiscal year and fiscal year  the company paid million  for a total of million  in accordance with the earn out terms noted above  and reported the payment as additional purchase price resulting in incremental goodwill 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
all intangible assets are reviewed periodically for potential impairment 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment 
in fiscal years  and  there was no impairment of goodwill 
other intangible assets are tested quarterly for impairment 
the company recognized impairment charges of million  million and in  and  respectively  for intangible assets other than goodwill 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
income taxes 
estimates of effective tax rates  deferred taxes assets and valuation allowance when preparing our financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and assess temporary differences due to different treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes thereby resulting in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  on a quarterly basis  we perform an assessment of the recoverability of the deferred income tax assets  which is principally dependent upon our ability to achieve taxable income in specific geographies 

table of contents as of september   the company had net operating loss carry forwards of million  research and development credits of million  foreign tax credits carry forwards of million and state research and development tax credits of million available to offset future taxable income 
the company s carry forwards will expire over the periods through if not utilized 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
after examining the available evidence at september   we believe a full valuation allowance was necessary for the us federal and state and certain foreign net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
in accordance with sfas no 
 evidence such as operating results during recent periods is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability  which are inherently uncertain 
our past financial performance presented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our us federal and state and certain foreign deferred tax assets under sfas no 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support realization of the us federal and state deferred tax assets 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 

fin no 
clarifies the accounting for uncertain income tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the interpretation stipulates recognition and measurement criteria in addition to classification and interim period accounting and significantly expanded disclosure provisions for uncertain tax positions that are expected to be taken in a company s tax return 
fin no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company will adopt this statement for the fiscal management has not yet determined the impact of the adoption of fin no 
on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
stock based compensation expense 
prior to october   we accounted for our stock based employee compensation arrangements under the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 as allowed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 

as a result  no expense was recognized for options to purchase our common stock that were granted with an exercise price equal to fair market value at the date of grant and no expense was recognized in connection with purchases under our employee stock purchase plan for fiscal year in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after june  subsequent to the effective date  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expenses over the requisite service period of the award 
to estimate the fair value of an award  the company uses the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires inputs such as expected term  expected volatility  and risk free interest rate 
further  the forfeiture rate also impacts the amount of aggregate compensation 
these inputs are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
while estimates of expected term  volatility  and forfeiture rate are derived primarily from the company s historical data  the risk free interest rate is based on the yield available on us treasury zero coupon issues 
we have adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
under this method  compensation cost recognized during fiscal year ended september   includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of october   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
amortized on a graded vesting basis over the options vesting period  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to october   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r amortized on a straight line basis over the options vesting period 
the company has elected to use the alternative transition 
table of contents provisions described in fasb staff position fas no 
r for the calculation of its pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
pro forma results for prior periods have not been restated 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
r on october   the company s net loss for fiscal years ended september  and are million and million  respectively  higher than had it continued to account for stock based employee compensation under apb no 
the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r for fiscal years ended september  and were to increase both the basic and diluted loss per share by and  respectively 
the adoption of sfas no 
r had no impact on cash flows from operations or financing 
while the company uses black scholes models for valuing share based payments under both sfas no 
and sfas no 
r  there are some differences in the valuation methodologies and assumptions used for the calculations 
under sfas no 
 the company uses the black scholes multi option valuation model with graded amortization  whereas under sfas no 
r the company uses the black scholes single option valuation model with straight line amortization 
also  under sfas no 
 all options are valued under a single assumption of expected term while under sfas no 
r  the company has divided option recipients into three groups outside directors  officers  and non officer employees and determined the expected term for each group based on the historical activity of that group 
furthermore  under sfas no 
 forfeitures are recognized only as they actually occur whereas under sfas no 
r  forfeiture rates are included in the initial accrual of compensation cost and revised as actual experience differs from initial estimates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk we consider investments purchased with an original remaining maturity of less than three months at date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities in thousands september  cash and cash equivalents marketable securities total our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use leverage or derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
during fiscal year  to reduce administrative costs and liquidity risks  the company implemented a change in its practices regarding the investment of its cash which led to the elimination of its holdings of marketable securities and an increase in money market fund investments which are considered cash equivalents 
in connection with this change  the company sold all of its marketable securities and moved the proceeds to money market funds 
the company s investment policy permits it to invest in securities with risks greater than those of money market funds and the company may do so in the future 
a characteristic of money market funds is that their unit values are not generally sensitive to changes in interest rates 
therefore  investors in these funds are generally not subject to the risk of capital loss from sudden changes in interest rates 
in fiscal year  our investments were primarily debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  municipal bonds  and high quality corporate notes and by policy  the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
table of contents was limited 
with these types of investments  a sharp increase in interest rates can have a materially negative impact on the valuation of the securities 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value of marketable securities held at september  and that were sensitive to changes in interest rates in thousands valuation of securities fair value valuation of securities given an interest rate of given an interest rate decrease of x basis points marketable increase of x basis points bps bps bps securities bps bps bps as of september  as of september  these marketable securities were considered available for sale investments 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps  and bps 
a basis point is defined as one hundredth of a percentage point 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities will have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if there is a decline in interest rates 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations  or we may suffer a loss if we again invest in marketable securities and any of those securities subsequently decline in market value due to the types of changes in interest rates described above 
foreign currency risk international sales are primarily sourced in their respective countries and are primarily denominated in us dollars 
however  our international subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by changes in these or other factors 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from inter company accounts in which costs incurred in the united states are charged to our foreign sales subsidiaries 
these inter company accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
currencies in which we have significant intercompany balances are the taiwan dollar  hong kong dollar  japanese yen  and the euro 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
the impact from a hypothetical percent appreciation depreciation of the us dollar from september  market rates would be immaterial to our net loss
