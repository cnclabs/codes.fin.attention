table of contents operations of the business operating strategy our overall operating strategy is to take advantage of the global opportunities to grow our core business profitably through increased product revenue and expanded distributorships  while continuing to improve and maintain a strong balance sheet 
in august  we announced five initiatives designed to help us execute our strategy 
these included developing a global approach to revenue generation and resource management  accelerating new product introductions  improving distributor communications and support  enhancing profitability through commission restructuring and cost controls  addressing and revamping our operations infrastructure  policies  procedures and our controls 
in our efforts to focus on revenue generation initiatives  we have carefully reviewed each of our markets  identified the opportunities and constraints  and are now working closely with each corporate and local management team to implement specific plans for their markets 
we redefined the company s mission as committed to the wellness of the world 
this new mission statement provides an umbrella concept that our distributors can embrace while directly linking with our corporate name 
to improve distributor communications and support  the company initiated a complete overhaul of its web site for its global distributors that will unify the company s branding and overall graphic presentation 
the new web site will allow for greater local market customization and adaptation making it much more user friendly for the company s distributors 
additionally  we are investing greater resources in distributor training in several of our key markets  including china  and have introduced new training modules that standardize our messages worldwide 
initiatives were undertaken in to reduce expenses resulting in fairly substantial reductions in non essential spending 
we anticipate continuing these efforts in as the company looks to identify other cost control and headcount reduction opportunities 
we are also in the process of revamping our distributor commission structure that currently is one of the most generous of any direct selling company 
we expect to add new incentives for increased product sales while re focusing commissions for expanded distributorships 
the new commission structure is expected to be in place sometime in the first half of sourcing of products the company s independent research consultants and the executive staff work with research and development personnel of our manufacturers and other prospective vendors to create product concepts and develop the product ideas into actual products 
each of the company s three current major product lines skindulgence  alura and premium noni juice were originally conceived by our manufacturing vendors 
the company or its subsidiaries then enter into supply agreements with the vendors pursuant to which the company obtains exclusive rights to sell the products under private labels or trademarks that are owned by the company 
because our current main products all came to us originally as proposals from our vendors  we have incurred minimal out of pocket research and development costs through december  the company or its subsidiaries generally purchase finished goods from manufacturers and sell them to our distributors for their resale or personal consumption 
aloe commodities international for skindulgence  js llc for alura and two harbor trading for premium noni juice are the three most significant vendors  accounting for a majority of the company s product purchases 
the company is required to purchase from js llc a minimum volume of barrels of product per quarter to maintain the exclusivity and volume discount rights granted in the agreement 
the terms of these agreements are between one and three years  with annual automatic renewal 
we believe that  in the event we are unable to source products from these suppliers or the other suppliers of our other products  our revenue  income and cash flow could be adversely and materially impacted 

table of contents marketing and distribution our distributors are independent full time or part time contractors who purchase products directly from our subsidiaries via the internet for resale to retail consumers other than in china  europe  and certain other markets or for their own personal consumption 
purchasers of our products in china  europe and certain other markets may purchase only for their own personal consumption and not for resale 
the growth of a distributor s business depends largely upon their ability to recruit a down line network of distributors and the popularity of our products in the marketplace 
the following table sets forth the number of active distributors by market for the time periods indicated 
we consider a distributor active if they have placed at least one product order with us during the preceding year

table of contents to become an nht global distributor  a prospective distributor must agree to the terms and conditions of our distributor agreement posted on our website 
nht global distributors generally pay a annual enrollment fee 
the distributor agreement sets forth our policies and procedures  and we may elect to terminate a distributor for non compliance 
we pay commissions to eligible nht global distributors based on sales by such distributors down line distributors during a given commission period 
to be eligible to receive commissions  distributors in some countries may be required to make nominal monthly purchases of products 
we believe that the uniqueness and desirability of our nht global products  combined with a high commission rate  creates a highly desirable business opportunity and work environment for our nht global distributors 
see working with distributors 
distributors generally place orders through the internet and pay by credit card prior to shipment 
accordingly  we carry minimal accounts receivable and credit losses are historically minimal 
we sponsor promotional meetings and motivational training events in key cities in our markets for current and potential nht global distributors 
these events are designed to inform prospective and existing distributors about both existing and new product lines as well as selling techniques 
distributors typically share their direct selling experiences  their individual selling styles and their recruiting methods at these promotional or training events 
prospective distributors are educated about the structure  dynamics and benefits of the direct selling industry 
we are continually developing or updating our marketing strategies and programs to motivate our distributors 
these programs are designed to increase distributors monthly product sales and the recruiting of new distributors in their down lines 
management information systems the nht global business uses our proprietary web based marketvision system to process orders and to communicate volume and commissions to distributors 
other than marketvision  the company has not automated and integrated other critical business processes such as inventory management and accounting 
the company began automating a majority of the financial reporting processes with oracle s e business suite in the fourth quarter of and expects to continue this process into early geographic locations the company s business is generally organized along geographic lines 
nht global has active physical presence in the following markets o north america united states and canada o greater china hong kong  macau  taiwan and china o southeast asia singapore  the philippines and indonesia o australia and new zealand o south korea o japan o latin america primarily mexico o slovenia natural health trends corp 
is headquartered and mainly staffed in dallas  texas 
marketvision is staffed in minneapolis  minnesota 
see item properties for specific locations of our facilities 
employees at december   we employed total employees world wide  of which were located in the united states  one in the cayman islands  four in canada  in hong kong and china  in taiwan  four in the philippines  nine in singapore  in south korea  in mexico  in japan  and seven in australia 

table of contents seasonality historically our revenue has not been impacted by seasonality on any significant basis 
from quarter to quarter  the company is somewhat impacted by seasonal factors and trends such as major cultural events and vacation patterns 
for example  most asian markets celebrate their respective local new year in the first quarter  which generally has a negative impact on that quarter 
we believe that direct selling is also generally negatively impacted during the third quarter  when many individuals  including our distributors  traditionally take time off for vacations 
in addition  the national holidays in hong kong  china and taiwan in early october tend to have a significant adverse effect on sales in those markets 
the company s spending is materially affected by the major events planned for at different times of the year 
a major promotional event could significantly increase the reported expenses during the quarter in which the event actually takes place  while the revenue that might be generated by the event may not occur in the same reporting period 
intellectual property most of our products are packaged under a private label arrangement 
we have applied for trademark registration for names  logos and various product names in several countries into which we are doing business or considering expanding into 
we currently have three trademark registrations in the united states 
we also rely on common law trademark rights to protect our unregistered trademarks 
these common law trademark rights do not provide us with the same level of protection as afforded by a united states federal registration trademark 
common law trademark rights are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is actually utilized  while a united states federal registration of a trademark enables the registrant to discontinue the unauthorized use of the trademark by a third party anywhere in the united states even if the registrant has never used the trademark in the geographic area where the trademark is being used  provided  however  that the unauthorized third party user has not  prior to the registration date  perfected its common law rights in the trademark within that geographic area 
in november  the inventor of our alura product  from whom we have a license to distribute alura  was awarded a patent for the formulation of that product 
as a result of a settlement agreement with toyota motor sales  usa  the company changed the name of lexxus international to nht global  inc and the terms lexxus and lexxus international were replaced in all other uses by the company and its subsidiaries by the terms nht global or a variation that includes nht or natural health trends 
in connection with this name change  the company applied for registration of rights in these names and related marks in several countries in which we do business 
in  the company implemented a foreign holding and operating company structure for our non united states businesses  which involved the division of our united states and non united states operations 
as part of implementing this structure  the company and some of its united states subsidiaries granted an exclusive license to some of the company s non united states subsidiaries to use outside of the united states all of their intangible property  including trademarks  trade secrets and other proprietary information 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
insurance the company currently carries general liability insurance in the amount of  per occurrence and  in the aggregate as well as customary cargo and other insurance coverage  including coverage for international subsidiaries 
we do not carry product liability insurance  but may be covered by the insurance maintained by our principal suppliers 
there can be no assurance  however  that product liability insurance would be available  and if available  that it would be sufficient to cover potential claims or that an adequate level of coverage would be available in the future at a reasonable cost  if at all 
a successful product liability claim could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
working with distributors sponsorship sponsoring new distributors creates multiple levels in the direct selling structure of nht global 
the persons that a distributor sponsors within the network are referred to as sponsored distributors 
persons newly recruited are assigned by distributors into network positions that can be under other distributors  thus they can be called down line distributors 
if down line distributors also sponsor new distributors  they create additional levels within the structure  but their down line distributors remain in the same down line network as their original sponsoring distributor 

table of contents we rely on our distributors to recruit and sponsor new distributors 
our top up line distributors tend to focus on building their network of down line distributors and assisting them with the sale of our products 
while we provide product samples  brochures and other sales materials  distributors are primarily responsible for recruiting and educating their new distributors with respect to products  the compensation plan and how to build a successful distributorship network 
distributors are not required to sponsor other distributors as their down line  and we do not pay any commissions for sponsoring new distributors 
however  because of the financial incentives provided to those who succeed in building a distributor network that consumes and resells products  we believe that many of our distributors attempt  with varying degrees of effort and success  to sponsor additional distributors 
because they are seeking new opportunities for income  people are often attracted to become distributors after using our products or after attending introductory seminars 
once a person becomes a distributor  he or she is able to purchase products directly from us at wholesale prices via the internet 
the distributor is also entitled to sponsor other distributors in order to build a network of distributors and product users 
compensation plans nht global employs what is commonly referred to as a binary compensation plan 
we believe that one of our key competitive advantages within the direct selling industry is our compensation plan for distributors 
under the nht global compensation plan  distributors are paid weekly commissions in the market in which the distributor signed up  in that local currency  for product sold by that distributor s down line distributor network across all geographic markets 
distributors are not paid commissions on purchases or sales of our products made directly by them  but instead earn a spread between the wholesale price to the distributor and the retail price received by the distributor 
this seamless compensation plan enables a distributor located in one country to sponsor other distributors located in other countries where we are authorized to conduct our business 
currently  there are two fundamental ways in which nht global distributors can earn income through retail markups on sales of products purchased by distributors at wholesale prices this retail markup is not available in all of our markets  and through a series of commissions paid on product purchases made by their down line distributors 
each of our products is designated a specified number of sales volume points  also called bonus volume or bv 
commissions are based on total personal and group sales volume points per sales period 
sales volume points are essentially a percentage of a product s wholesale price 
as the distributor s business expands from successfully sponsoring other distributors who in turn expand their own businesses by sponsoring other distributors  the distributor receives higher commissions from purchases made by an expanding down line network 
to be eligible to receive commissions  a distributor may be required to make nominal monthly purchases of our products 
certain of our subsidiaries do not require these nominal purchases for a distributor to be eligible to receive commissions 
in determining commissions  the number of levels of down line distributors included within the distributor s commissionable group increases as the number of distributorships directly below the distributor increases 
under our current compensation plan  commissions may be limited to of sales 
in some markets  commissions may be further limited 
from time to time we make modifications and enhancements to our compensation plan to help motivate distributors  which can have an impact on distributor commissions 
from time to time we also enter into agreements for business or market development  which may result in additional compensation to specific distributors 
distributor support we are committed to providing a high level of support services tailored to the needs of our distributors in each marketplace we are serving 
we attempt to meet the needs and build the loyalty of distributors by providing personalized distributor services and by maintaining a generous product return policy see product warranties and returns 
because many of our distributors are working on a part time basis and have only a limited number of hours each week to concentrate on their business  we believe that maximizing a distributor s efforts by providing effective distributor support has been  and could continue to be  important to our success 
through training meetings  annual conventions  web based messages  distributor focus groups  regular telephone conference calls and other personal contacts with distributors  we seek to understand and satisfy the needs of our distributors 
via our websites  we provide product fulfillment and tracking services that result in user friendly and timely product distribution 
most of our offices maintain meeting rooms  which our distributors may utilize for training and sponsoring activities 

table of contents to help maintain communication with our distributors  we offer the following support programs teleconferences we hold teleconferences with company management and associate field leadership on various subjects such as technical product discussions  distributor organization building and management techniques 
internet we maintain our main website at www 
naturalhealthtrendscorp 
com 
on this website  the user can read company news  learn more about various products  sign up to be a distributor  place orders  and track the fulfillment and delivery of their order 
product literature we offer a variety of literature to distributors  including product catalogs  informational brochures  pamphlets and posters for individual products 
toll free access we offer live consumer support where a customer service representative can address general questions or concerns 
broadcast e mail announcements from the company are sent via e mail to all active distributors 
technology and internet initiatives we believe that the internet has become increasingly important to our business as more consumers communicate online and purchase products over the internet as opposed to traditional retail and direct sales channels 
as a result  we have committed significant resources to our e commerce capabilities and the abilities of our distributors to take advantage of the internet 
substantially all of our sales have occurred via the internet 
nht global offers a global web page that allows a distributor to have a personalized website through which he or she can sell products in all of the countries in which we do business 
links to these websites can be found at our main website at www 
naturalhealthtrendscorp 
com 
the information provided on these websites should not be considered part of this report 
rules affecting distributors our distributor policies and procedures establish the rules that distributors must follow in each country 
we also monitor distributor activity in an attempt to provide our distributors with a level playing field so that one distributor may not be disadvantaged by the activities of another 
we require our distributors to present products and business opportunities in an ethical and professional manner 
distributors further agree that their presentations to customers must be consistent with  and limited to  the product claims and representations made in our literature 
we require that we produce or pre approve all sales aids used by distributors such as videotapes  audiotapes  brochures and promotional clothing 
further  distributors may not use any form of media advertising to promote products unless it is pre approved by the company 
products may be promoted only by personal contact or by literature produced or approved by us 
distributors are not entitled to use our trademarks or other intellectual property without our prior consent 
our compliance department reviews reports of alleged distributor misbehavior 
if we determine that a distributor has violated our distributor policies or procedures  we may terminate the distributor s rights completely 
alternatively  we may impose sanctions  such as warnings  probation  withdrawal or denial of an award  suspension of privileges of the distributorship  fines  withholding commissions  until specified conditions are satisfied or other appropriate injunctive relief 
our distributors are independent contractors  not employees  and may act independently of us 
further  our distributors may resign or terminate their distributorship at any time without notice 
see item a risk factors 

table of contents government regulations direct selling activities direct selling  or multi level marketing  activities are regulated by various federal  state and local governmental agencies in the united states and foreign countries 
these laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes  often referred to as pyramid schemes  which compensate participants for recruiting additional participants irrespective of product sales  use high pressure recruiting methods and or do not involve legitimate products 
the laws and regulations in our current markets often impose cancellation product return  inventory buy backs and cooling off rights for consumers and distributors  require us or our distributors to register with governmental agencies  impose reporting requirements  and impose upon us requirements  such as requiring distributors to maintain levels of retail sales to qualify to receive commissions  to ensure that distributors are being compensated for sales of products and not for recruiting new distributors 
the laws and regulations governing direct selling are modified from time to time  and  like other direct selling companies  we are subject from time to time to government investigations in our various markets related to our direct selling activities 
this can require us to make changes to our business model and aspects of our global compensation plan in the markets impacted by such changes and investigations 
based on advice of our engaged outside professionals in existing markets  the nature and scope of inquiries from government regulatory authorities and our history of operations in those markets to date  we believe our method of distribution complies in all material respects with the laws and regulations related to direct selling of the countries in which we currently operate 
as a result of restrictions in china on direct selling activities  we are not currently selling our products directly in china 
chinese consumers and members purchase the company s products via a hong kong based web site 
the regulatory environment in china is complex 
because we operate a direct selling model outside of china  our operations in china have attracted constant and significant regulatory and media scrutiny 
at the end of  china adopted new direct selling and anti pyramiding regulations that are restrictive and contain various limitations  including a restriction on the ability to pay multi level compensation to independent distributors 
regulations are subject to discretionary interpretation by municipal and provincial level regulators 
interpretations of what constitutes permissible activities by regulators can vary from province to province and can change from time to time because of the lack of clearly defined rules regarding direct selling activities 
because of the chinese government s significant concerns about direct selling activities  it scrutinizes very closely activities of direct selling companies 
the scrutiny has increased following adoption of the new direct selling and anti pyramiding regulations and our business continues to be subject to reviews and investigations by municipal and provincial level regulators 
at times  investigations and related actions by government regulators have caused an obstruction to our members activities in certain locations  and have resulted in a few cases in enforcement actions 
in each of these cases  we helped our members with their defense in the legality of their conduct 
so far  no material changes to our business model were required 
we expect to receive continued guidance and direction as we work with regulators to address our business model and any changes we make to comply with the new direct selling regulations 
in accordance with the new direct selling regulations  we have applied for a direct selling license 
it is not clear when direct selling licenses will be issued and how the government in china is processing these applications 
if and when we receive a direct selling license  we plan to augment our current business model by conducting direct selling activities within china 
regulation of our products our products and related promotional and marketing activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation by numerous governmental agencies and authorities in the united states  including the fda  the ftc  the consumer product safety commission  the united states department of agriculture  state attorneys general and other state regulatory agencies 
in our foreign markets  the products are generally regulated by similar government agencies  such as the ministry of health and welfare in japan and the department of health in taiwan 
in the event a product  or an ingredient in a product  is classified as a drug or pharmaceutical product in any market  we will generally not be able to distribute that product in that market through our distribution channel because of strict restrictions applicable to drug and pharmaceutical products 

table of contents most of our major markets also regulate advertising and product claims regarding the efficacy of products 
this is particularly true with respect to our dietary supplements because we typically market them as foods or health foods 
for example  in the united states  we are unable to claim that any of our nutritional supplements will diagnose  cure  mitigate  treat or prevent disease 
in the united states  the dietary supplement health and education act  however  permits substantiated  truthful and non misleading statements of nutritional support to be made in labeling  such as statements describing general well being resulting from consumption of a dietary ingredient or the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient in affecting or maintaining a structure or a function of the body 
most of the other markets in which we operate have not adopted similar legislation and we may be subject to more restrictive limitations on the claims we can make about our products in these markets 
during the fall of  the customs agency of the government of south korea brought a charge against lxk  ltd 
lxk  the company s wholly owned subsidiary operating in south korea  with respect to the importation of the company s alura product 
the customs agency alleged that alura is not a cosmetic product  but rather should be categorized and imported as a pharmaceutical product 
on february   the seoul central district court ruled against lxk and fined it a total of million korean won approximately  at december  
lxk also incurred related costs of million korean won approximately  at december  as a result of the judgment 
the company recorded a reserve for the entire million korean won at december  and appealed the ruling 
on may   an intermediate court of appeals issued a ruling that the company believes reversed that part of the judgment that had imposed million korean won of the fine  but upheld the fine of million korean won which has already been paid and the ruling that alura cannot be imported as a cosmetic product 
lxk has filed an appeal of this ruling with the korean supreme court 
the company has been unable to determine with certainty that it will not be subject to the fine of million korean won if the appeal is unsuccessful  and will therefore continue to reserve million korean won approximately  at december  
the inability to sell alura in south korea if the appeal is unsuccessful is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow or business prospects of lxk 
see item legal proceedings 
other regulatory issues as a united states entity operating through subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions  we are subject to foreign exchange control  transfer pricing and custom laws that regulate the flow of funds between our subsidiaries and us for product purchases  management services and contractual obligations  such as the payment of distributor commissions 
as is the case with most companies that operate in our product categories  we might receive from time to time inquiries from government regulatory authorities regarding the nature of our business and other issues  such as compliance with local direct selling  transfer pricing  customs  taxation  foreign exchange control  securities and other laws 
negative publicity resulting from inquiries into our operations by united states and state government agencies in the early s  stemming in part from alleged inappropriate product and earnings claims by distributors could adversely harm our business 
product warranties and returns the nht global refund policies and procedures closely follow industry and country specific standards  which vary greatly by country 
for example  in the united states  the direct selling association recommends that direct sellers permit returns during the twelve month period following the sale  while in hong kong the standard return policy is days following the sale 
our return policies have conformed to local laws or the recommendation of the local direct selling association 
in most cases  distributors who timely return unopened product that is in resalable condition may receive a refund 
the amount of the refund may be dependent on the country in which the sale occurred  the timeliness of the return  and any applicable re stocking fee 
nht global must be notified of the return in writing and such written requests would be considered a termination notice of the distributorship 
from time to time  we alter our return policy in response to special circumstances 
for example  in april  a television program was aired in the people s republic of china with respect to the operations of the company s hong kong subsidiary and the representative office located in beijing 
the television program made allegations that the company s hong kong operations engaged in fraudulent activities and sold products without proper permits 
in order to address the concerns of many independent distributors  the company extended its existing day return policy in hong kong to days to allow distributors and customers who purchased products during the two week period prior to  and the two week period after  the airing of the television program to return purchased merchandise for a full refund 
in october  this special extended product return policy expired 

table of contents our industry we are engaged in the direct selling industry  selling life style enhancement products  cosmetics  personal care and dietary supplements 
more specifically  we are engaged in what is called network marketing or multi level marketing 
this type of organizational structure and approach to marketing and sales include companies selling life style enhancement products  cosmetics and dietary supplements  or selling other types of consumer products  such as tupperware corporation and amway corp 
generally  direct selling is based upon an organizational structure in which independent distributors of a company s products are compensated for sales made directly to consumers 
nht global distributors are compensated for sales generated by distributors they have recruited and all subsequent distributors recruited by their down line network of distributors 
the experience of the direct selling industry has been that once a sizeable network of distributors is established  new and alternative products and services can be offered to those distributors for sale to consumers and additional distributors 
the successful introduction of new products can dramatically increase sales and profits for both distributors and the direct selling marketing organization 
competition we compete with a significant number of other retailers that are engaged in similar lines of business  including sellers of health related products and other direct sellers such as nu skin enterprises  inc  usana health sciences  inc  mannatech  inc  reliv international  inc  and herbalife  ltd 
many of the competitors have greater name recognition and financial resources than us as well as many more distributors 
the direct selling channel tends to sell products at a higher price compared to traditional retailers  which poses a degree of competitive risk 
there is no assurance that we would continue to compete effectively against retail stores  internet based retailers or other direct sellers 
item a 
risk factors the company is exposed to a variety of risks that are inherent in our business and industry 
the following are some of the more significant factors that could affect our business and results of operations 
we may continue to experience substantial negative cash flows  which may have a significant adverse effect on our business and could threaten our solvency 
we have experienced substantial negative cash flows during the years ended december  and  primarily due to increase in investment in as well as declines in our revenues without as much proportional decreases in expenditures in if this trend continued  the decreasing cash balance could impair our ability to support our operations and  eventually  threaten our solvency  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition as well as our stock price 
negative cash flows and the related adverse market perception associated therewith may have negatively affected  and may in the future negatively affect  our ability to attract new distributors and or sell our products 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining an adequate level of cash resources and we could be forced to act more aggressively in the area of expense reduction in order to conserve cash resources as we look for alternative solutions 
if we continue to experience negative cash flows  we may need to seek debt or equity financing  which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if available  it could have a dilutive effect on the holdings of existing stockholders 
unless we are able to stabilize or grow revenues  control expenses and achieve positive cash flows  our ability to support our obligations could be impaired and our liquidity could be adversely affected and our solvency and our ability to repay our debts when they come due could be threatened 
we may need to seek additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms in order to improve our liquidity 
however  we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on satisfactory terms  or at all  and any new financing could have a dilutive effect to our existing stockholders 
we face risks related to an sec investigation and securities litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with our distributors  business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may face additional litigation in the future that could also harm our business 
in october  the sec issued a formal order of investigation to determine whether there have been violations of the federal securities laws by us and or others involved with us 
although we have fully cooperated with the sec in this matter and intend to continue to fully cooperate  we cannot predict when this investigation will be completed or its outcome 
we could face sanctions in 
table of contents connection with any resolution of the sec investigation  including but not limited to  significant monetary penalties and injunctive relief 
in addition  we and certain of our directors and officers have been named as defendants in a securities class action lawsuit 
due to the volatility of the stock market and particularly the stock prices of network marketing companies  it is possible that we will face additional class action lawsuits in the future 
the findings and outcome of the sec investigation may affect the class action and other lawsuits that are pending and any future litigation that we may face 
any settlement of the class action and other litigation or any resolution of the sec investigation may involve significant cash payments that could create or increase negative cash flows 
if we are unable to achieve a settlement of the class action and other litigation  we could be liable for large damage awards 
there can be no assurance that damage awards  if any  and the costs of litigation will be covered by insurance 
if not  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
defending against existing and potential litigation and other governmental proceedings may continue to require significant attention and resources of our management 
there can be no assurance that the significant time and effort spent will not adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
continued adverse news about the company could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract and maintain distributors 
our recent operating performance  changes in management  decline in stock price  sec investigation of us and lawsuits filed against us may have negatively affected  and may continue to negatively affect  our ability to attract and retain distributors  without whom we would be unable to sell our products and generate revenues 
loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business 
our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of our top management and key consultants  particularly our management personnel responsible for our hong kong and marketvision subsidiaries 
in november  the company terminated the top two employees  mark woodburn  former president and director of the company  and terry lacore  former chief executive officer of nht global and former director of the company  due to misconduct 
although we have recently settled our disputes with these individuals  the changes in senior management during the last twelve months may have had a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we also depend on the ability of our executive officers and other members of senior management to work effectively as a team 
the loss of one or more of our executive officers  members of our senior management  or key consultants could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
as a network marketing company  we rely on an independent sales force and we do not have direct control over the marketing of our products 
we rely on non employee  independent distributors to market and sell our products 
we have a large number of distributors and a relatively small corporate staff to implement our marketing programs and to provide motivational support and training to our distributors 
distributors may voluntarily terminate their agreements with us at any time  and there is typically significant turnover in our distributors from year to year 
since we cannot exert the same level of influence or control over our independent distributors as we could were they our own employees  our distributors could fail to comply with our distributor policies and procedures  which could result in claims against us that could harm our financial condition and operating results 
our distributors are independent contractors and  accordingly  we are not in a position to directly provide the same direction  motivation and oversight as we would if distributors were our own employees 
as a result  there can be no assurance that our distributors will participate in our marketing strategies or plans  accept our introduction of new products  or comply with our distributor policies and procedures 
extensive federal  state and local laws regulate our business  our products and our network marketing program 
because we have expanded into foreign countries  our policies and procedures for our independent distributors differ due to the different legal requirements of each country in which we do business 
while we have implemented distributor policies and procedures designed to govern distributor conduct and to protect the goodwill associated with the company s trademarks and trade names  it can be difficult to enforce these policies and procedures because of the large number of distributors and their independent status given the size and diversity of our distributor force  we experience problems with distributors from time to time  
table of contents especially with respect to our distributors in foreign markets 
distributors often desire to enter a market  before we have received approval to do business  to gain an advantage in the marketplace 
improper distributor activity in new geographic markets could result in adverse publicity and can be particularly harmful to our ability to ultimately enter these markets 
violations by our distributors of applicable law or of our policies and procedures in dealing with customers could reflect negatively on our products and operations  and harm our business reputation 
in addition  it is possible that a court could hold us civilly or criminally accountable based on vicarious liability because of the actions of our independent distributors 
if any of these events occur  the value of an investment in our common shares could be impaired 
we may be unable to protect or use our intellectual property rights 
we rely on trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties  all of which offer only limited protection 
moreover  the laws of some countries in which we market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property rights 
the unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our intellectual property could enable third parties to benefit from such property without paying us for it 
for example  limited protection of intellectual property is available under chinese law  and the local manufacturing of our products may subject us to an increased risk that unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use our product formulations 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive and could involve a high degree of risk 
it is also possible that our use of our intellectual property rights could be found to infringe on prior rights of others and  in that event  we could be compelled to stop or modify the infringing use  which could be burdensome and expensive 
claims may arise against the company from unknown oral agreements and misconduct of former officers and directors 
the company has investigated oral agreements entered into and misconduct by mr 
mark woodburn  a former director and the former president of the company  and mr 
terry lacore  a former director of the company and the former chief executive officer of the company s subsidiary  nht global us there can be no assurance that all such oral agreements and misconduct have been discovered 
additional discoveries could lead to claims and proceedings against the company  its subsidiaries and their officers and directors 
if it is determined that any conduct by messrs 
woodburn and lacore violated any law  there can be no assurance that the company or one or more of its subsidiaries would not be subjected to prosecution or adverse proceedings 
any such claims  prosecutions or other proceedings and the cost of their defense could have a material adverse impact on the reputation  business and financial condition of the company 
adverse publicity associated with our products  ingredients or network marketing program  or those of similar companies  could harm our financial condition and operating results 
adverse publicity concerning any actual or claimed failure of our company or our distributors to comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding product claims and advertising  good manufacturing practices  the regulation of our network marketing program  the licensing of our products for sale in our target markets or other aspects of our business  whether or not resulting in enforcement actions or the imposition of penalties  could have an adverse effect on the goodwill of our company and could negatively affect our ability to attract  motivate and retain distributors  which would negatively impact our ability to generate revenue 
we cannot ensure that all distributors will comply with applicable legal requirements relating to the advertising  labeling  licensing or distribution of our products 
in addition  our distributors and consumers perception of the safety and quality of our products and ingredients as well as similar products and ingredients distributed by other companies can be significantly influenced by national media attention  publicized scientific research or findings  widespread product liability claims and other publicity concerning our products or ingredients or similar products and ingredients distributed by other companies 
adverse publicity  whether or not accurate or resulting from consumers use or misuse of our products  that associates consumption of our products or ingredients or any similar products or ingredients with illness or other adverse effects  questions the benefits of our or similar products or claims that any such products are ineffective  inappropriately labeled or have inaccurate instructions as to their use  could negatively impact our reputation or the market demand for our products 
network marketing systems such as ours are frequently subject to laws and regulations directed at ensuring that product sales are made to consumers of the products and that compensation  recognition  and advancement within the marketing organization are based on the sale of products rather than investment in the sponsoring company 
we are subject to the risk that  in one or more of our present or future markets  our marketing system could be found not to comply with these laws and regulations or may be prohibited 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations or such a prohibition could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  
table of contents and results of operations 
further we may simply be prohibited from distributing products through a network marketing channel in some foreign countries  or be forced to alter our compensation plan 
our failure to maintain and expand our distributor relationships could adversely affect our business 
we distribute our products through independent distributors  and we depend upon them directly for all of our sales 
accordingly  our success depends in significant part upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate a large base of distributors 
our direct selling organization is headed by a relatively small number of key distributors 
the loss of a significant number of distributors  including any key distributors  could materially and adversely affect sales of our products and could impair our ability to attract new distributors 
moreover  the replacement of distributors could be difficult because  in our efforts to attract and retain distributors  we compete with other direct selling organizations  including but not limited to those in the personal care  cosmetic product and nutritional supplement industries 
our distributors may terminate their services with us at any time and  in fact  like most direct selling organizations  we have a high rate of attrition 
if the number or productivity of independent distributors does not increase  our revenue could not increase 
to increase revenue  we must increase the number and or the productivity of our distributors 
we can provide no assurances that distributor numbers could increase or remain constant or that their productivity could increase 
we experienced a decrease in active distributors during excluding kgc and the kaire entities  following a and increase in active distributors in and the number of active distributors may not increase and could decline in the future 
distributors may terminate their services at any time  and  like most direct selling companies  we experience a high turnover among distributors from year to year 
we cannot accurately predict any fluctuation in the number and productivity of distributors because we primarily rely upon existing distributors to sponsor and train new distributors and to motivate new and existing distributors 
operating results could be adversely affected if our existing and new business opportunities and products do not generate sufficient economic incentive or interest to retain existing distributors and to attract new distributors 
because our hong kong operations account for a majority of our business  any adverse changes in our business operations in hong kong would materially harm our business 
in  and  approximately  and of our revenue  respectively  was generated in hong kong 
various factors could harm our business in hong kong  such as worsening economic conditions or other events that are out of our control 
for example  on april   a television program was aired in the people s republic of china with respect to the operations of the company s hong kong subsidiary and the company s representative office located in beijing 
the television program alleged that the company s hong kong operations engaged in fraudulent activities and sold products without proper permits 
due to the adverse publicity caused by the airing of the television program  revenues from hong kong declined significantly 
there have been other isolated cases of alleged misconduct by our members in china 
if the alleged misconduct of our members in china is finally determined to be illegal and attributable to the company or its subsidiaries  then this could have a material adverse affect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
our business in hong kong  which represented of our revenue in  may be harmed by the results of increased government scrutiny of our current and proposed operations in china 
since  direct selling has been restricted in china to ten companies that have an approval that the company does not currently have 
in november  the chinese government adopted an anti multilevel marketing legislation ahead of its december adoption of legislation to legalize direct selling 
the government has rigorously monitored multi level marketing activities and enforced these laws 
in the past  the government has taken significant actions against companies that the government found in violation of applicable laws 
governmental actions included shutting down their businesses and arresting alleged perpetrators 
consequently  a few of our direct selling peer companies have modified their business models and started selling to chinese consumers through owned  leased or franchised retail outlets 
we have not implemented a direct sales model in china although we have applied for a direct selling license 
instead  the company is planning on initially launching a preferred customer retail only e commerce model in china 
this retail only model would not have a compensation plan until such time as a direct selling license may be issued 
further  the chinese entity will operate completely separate and apart from the hong kong entity  though a chinese consumer may elect to participate separately in both 
while it is not certain if the chinese government will embrace this model  the company believes that the china entity will be compliant as it will not be operating a direct selling model in china until it receives a direct selling license 

table of contents we could be required to modify our compensation plan in china in a way that could make it less attractive to members  and this could have a significant adverse affect on our revenue 
we could be required to modify our compensation plan in china in a way that could make it less attractive to members 
any such modification to our compensation plan could  therefore  have a material adverse effect on revenue 
moreover  the business model that we anticipate implementing in china will likely involve costs and expenses that we do not generally incur in the e commerce business that we have historically operated in other markets  including hong kong 
as a result  the business that we ultimately are able to conduct in china could be materially less profitable than the e commerce business that we have historically operated in hong kong 
the company s e commerce business in hong kong  which represents a significant portion of the company s total revenue  could be adversely affected by the activities of the members in china  if members in china engage in activities that are deemed to violate china s anti multilevel marketing laws 
while the company has strictly forbidden any of its members in china to engage in activities that violate china s anti multilevel marketing laws  some of our members in china have engaged in such activities 
in dongguan  four of our members were detained for questioning in october with regard to possible violation of chinese law regarding the maximum number of people who can attend a meeting as well as possible improper network marketing business activity 
charges were never filed and all individuals were released 
in april   a media report indicated that someone was detained by public security in changsha for investigation of similar allegations 
the company has not been able to determine if the individual in question is  in fact  a member and whether or not any laws were actually broken 
initial inquiries made by retained chinese counsel indicate that no one is still being detained or has been charged 
reviews and investigations of such activities by government regulators  if any are commenced  could restrict our ability to conduct business 
most of the company s hong kong revenues are derived from the sale of products that are delivered to members in china 
the company operates an e commerce direct selling model in hong kong and recognizes this revenue as being generated in hong kong 
orders are taken in hong kong 
commissions are earned by members in china based on the same binary model used by the company throughout the world and are recorded and paid in hong kong and denominated in hong kong dollars 
commission incomes are declared to the tax authorities in hong kong 
members who order the products register themselves with a hong kong address and tax id number 
none of the servers on which the company s hong kong e commerce activities are conducted are located in china 
products purchased by members in china are delivered by the company to a third party that acts as the importer of record under an agreement to pay applicable duties 
from april through december  the importer of record was a related party see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes that the laws and regulations in china regarding direct selling and multi level marketing are not specifically applicable to the company s hong kong based e commerce activity 
nor is the company aware of any specific laws or regulations in china  or any official interpretation thereof  that govern this hong kong centered e commerce activity 
however  there can be no assurance that such laws  regulations or interpretations will not be adopted in the future 
should such laws  rules or interpretations be adopted or should the government determine that the company s e commerce activity violates china s anti multilevel marketing legislation  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business  cash flow and financial statements 
there is no way the company can estimate the effect of such an adverse effect 
although we would attempt to work closely with both national and local governmental agencies in implementing our plans  our efforts to comply with national and local laws may be harmed by a rapidly evolving regulatory climate  concerns about activities resembling violations of anti multi level marketing legislation and any subjective interpretation of laws 
any determination that our operations or activities  or the activities of our employee sales representatives  distributors living outside of china or importers of record are not in compliance with applicable regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines  extended interruptions of business  restrictions on our future ability to obtain business license or expand into new locations  substantially diminishing our ability to retain existing sales representatives and attract new sales representatives  changes to our business model  the termination of required licenses to conduct business  or other actions  all of which would harm our business 
if we fail to obtain a direct selling license in china  our future business could be harmed 
the chinese government has adopted new direct selling legislation as of december  the company has submitted an application for a direct selling license in december and  after rules changes  re submitted an application package in june the company thinks it met all of the legal requirements  including capitalizing our chinese entity with a million cash infusion  but there can be no assurance that a license will be granted 
the company plans to operate a preferred customer retail only e commerce model in china that is linked to a member s position in hong kong 
if the company in china is able to obtain a direct 
table of contents selling license  it would provide it with more options to do business 
if it does not  there would be some impact to the company but it is not believed that it would materially adversely affect the company under its proposed model 
failure to properly pay business taxes  including those in china  could have a material adverse effect 
in the course of doing business the company may be subject to various taxes  such as sales and use  value added  franchise  income  and import 
the failure to properly calculate  report and pay such taxes when the company is subject to them could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  any change in the law or regulations regarding such taxes  or any interpretation thereof  could result in an increase in the cost of doing business 
between april and december  the company s hong kong subsidiary engaged a service provider to facilitate product importation into china and act  or engage another party to act  as the importer of record 
the individual that owns that service provider is one of the directors of the company s wholly owned chinese subsidiary 
the company believes that the amount of duty paid to chinese customs on the imported goods by the importer of record was paid at the negotiated rate 
however  there can be no assurance that chinese customs will not elect  in the future  to examine the duty paid  and if they conduct such examination  they may conclude that the valuation established was insufficient  resulting in an underpayment of duties 
as a consequence  the importer of record could be required to pay additional duties and possible penalties to chinese customs 
additional duties could range between zero and million  plus penalties 
the extreme worst case was calculated using the highest possible assessment to the highest possible declared value and assuming that negotiated valuation practices do not apply 
the company believes that any such future assessment of additional duties or penalties would be made against and become the responsibility of the importer of record 
there can be no assurance that the company or its subsidiaries would not be assessed with such liability in the event that the importer of record is unable to pay all or part of such amount 
as we continue to expand into foreign markets our business becomes increasingly subject to political and economic risks 
changes in these markets could adversely affect our business 
we believe that our ability to achieve future growth is dependent in part on our ability to continue our international expansion efforts 
however  there can be no assurance that we would be able to grow in our existing international markets  enter new international markets on a timely basis  or that new markets would be profitable 
we must overcome significant regulatory and legal barriers before we can begin marketing in any foreign market 
also  it is difficult to assess the extent to which our products and sales techniques would be accepted or successful in any given country 
in addition to significant regulatory barriers  we may also encounter problems conducting operations in new markets with different cultures and legal systems from those encountered elsewhere 
we may be required to reformulate certain of our products before commencing sales in a given country 
once we have entered a market  we must adhere to the regulatory and legal requirements of that market 
no assurance can be given that we would be able to successfully reformulate our products in any of our current or potential international markets to meet local regulatory requirements or attract local customers 
the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain and retain necessary permits and approvals 
in many markets  other direct selling companies already have significant market penetration  the effect of which could be to desensitize the local distributor population to a new opportunity  or to make it more difficult for us to recruit qualified distributors 
there can be no assurance that  even if we are able to commence operations in foreign countries  there would be a sufficiently large population of potential distributors inclined to participate in a direct selling system offered by us 
we believe our future success could depend in part on our ability to seamlessly integrate our business methods  including distributor compensation plan  across all markets in which our products are sold 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to further develop and maintain a seamless compensation program 
an increase in the amount of compensation paid to distributors would reduce profitability 
a significant expense is the payment of compensation to our distributors  which represented approximately of net revenues during the increase is due to the growth of the distributor network and number of down line levels  an elevated level of promotions  local promotional programs and various business development agreements 
we compensate our distributors by paying commissions  bonuses  and certain awards and prizes 
we closely monitor the amount of compensation to distributors paid as a percentage of net sales and may need to adjust our compensation plan to prevent distributor compensation from having a significant adverse effect on earnings 
there can be no assurance that these changes or future changes to our compensation plan or product pricing would be successful in maintaining the level of distributor compensation expense as a percentage of net sales 
furthermore  these changes may make it difficult to recruit and retain qualified and motivated distributors 
an increase in compensation payments 
table of contents to distributors as a percentage of net sales will reduce our profitability 
under our current compensation plan  commissions may be limited to of sales 
see item working with distributors compensation plans 
we do not have product liability insurance and product liability claims could hurt our business 
currently  we do not have product liability insurance  although the insurance carried by our suppliers may cover certain product liability claims against us 
nevertheless  we do not conduct or sponsor clinical studies of our products 
as a marketer of nutraceuticals  cosmetics and other products that are ingested by consumers or applied to their bodies  we may become subjected to various product liability claims  including that our products contain contaminants  our products include inadequate instructions as to their uses  or our products include inadequate warnings concerning side effects and interactions with other substances 
if our suppliers product liability insurance fails to cover product liability claims or other product liability claims  or any product liability claims exceeds the amount of coverage provided by such policies or if we are unsuccessful in any third party claim against the manufacturer or if we are unsuccessful in collecting any judgment that may be recovered by the company against the manufacturer  we could be required to pay substantial monetary damages which could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result  we may become required to pay higher premiums and accept higher deductibles in order to secure adequate insurance coverage in the future 
especially since we do not have direct product liability insurance  it is possible that product liability claims and the resulting adverse publicity could negatively affect our business 
our internal controls and accounting methods require further modification 
the company modified certain of its accounting policies and made other adjustments to our accounting for past transactions  which resulted in the restatement of the company s financial statements for each quarter in   and  for the years ended december     and as well as the first quarter in in connection with the restatement of our financial statements  many of the restatement items are the result of material weaknesses in the company s internal controls and procedures 
also  in november  the company s top two officers at the time  mark woodburn and terry lacore  the president of the company and the chief executive officer of nht global us  respectively  were terminated due to management misconduct 
the company continues to develop controls and procedures and plans to implement additional controls and procedures sufficient to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis in the foreseeable future 
nevertheless  we continue to have material weaknesses 
if we are unable to develop and implement effective controls and procedures  we may not be able to report our financial performance on a timely basis and our business and stock price would be adversely affected 
see item a 
controls and procedures 
non compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of could materially adversely affect us 
the securities exchange commission  as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  adopted rules which could require us to include in our annual reports on form k  beginning in fiscal  an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
in addition  our independent auditors must attest to and report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of such internal controls over financial reporting beginning in fiscal while we intend to diligently and thoroughly document  review  test and improve our internal controls over financial reporting to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act  if our independent auditors are not satisfied with the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting  or if the independent auditors interpret the requirements  rules and or regulations differently than we do  then they may decline to attest to management s assessment or may issue a report that is qualified 
this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could negatively impact the price of our common stock 
we rely on and are subject to risks associated with our reliance upon information technology systems 
our success is dependent on the accuracy  reliability  and proper use of information processing systems and management information technology 
our information technology systems are designed and selected to facilitate order entry and customer billing  maintain distributor records  accurately track purchases and distributor compensation payments  manage accounting operations  generate reports  and provide customer service and technical support 
although we acquired marketvision our distributor software service provider during the first half of  in part  to gain greater control over its operations  any interruption in these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 

table of contents in connection with its acquisition of marketvision communications corporation in  the company and marketvision entered into a software license agreement the software license agreement dated as of march   with marketvision consulting group  llc the licensee  a limited liability company owned by john cavanaugh  the president of marketvision  and jason landry  a vice president of marketvision 
the software license agreement was filed on april   as an exhibit to the company s current report on form k and is incorporated by reference into the company s annual report on form k 
upon an event of default as defined  the software license agreement grants  among other things  the licensee with an irrevocable  exclusive  perpetual  royalty free  fully paid  worldwide  transferable  sublicensable right and license to use  copy  modify  distribute  rent  lease  enhance  transfer  market  and create derivative works to the marketvision software 
an event of default under the software license agreement includes a share default  which is defined as the market value per share of the company failing to equal or exceed per share for any one rolling period of six months for a certain period following the acquisition of marketvision 
the last time that the company s stock closed at or above per share was february   and a share default would otherwise have occurred on august  the parties to the software license agreement amended that agreement to provide that no share default will occur prior to december  no further amendments have been entered into  and as a result  the company is currently in default 
although an event of default has occurred  the company believes that it continues to have the right to continue using the marketvision software for its internal use only and not as an application service provider or service bureau  but may not rent  lease  license  transfer or distribute the software without the licensee s prior written consent 
moreover  the company believes that it has the right to receive certain application service provider services from licensee  if it chooses to do so 
the company does not believe that the occurrence of the event of default has had or will have a material adverse effect on the company 
regulatory matters governing our industry could have a significant negative effect on our business 
in both our united states and foreign markets  we are affected by extensive laws  governmental regulations  administrative determinations  court decisions and similar constraints 
such laws  regulations and other constraints may exist at the federal  state or local levels in the united states and at all levels of government in foreign jurisdictions 
there can be no assurance that we or our distributors are in compliance with all of these regulations 
our failure or our distributors failure to comply with these regulations or new regulations could lead to the imposition of significant penalties or claims and could negatively impact our business 
in addition  the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may negatively impact the marketing of our products  resulting in significant loss of sales revenues 
direct selling system our direct selling system is subject to a number of federal and state regulations administered by the federal trade commission the ftc and various state agencies as well as regulations in foreign markets administered by foreign agencies 
regulations applicable to direct selling organizations generally are directed at ensuring that product sales ultimately are made to consumers and that advancement within the organizations is based on sales of the organizations products rather than investments in the organizations or other non retail sales related criteria 
we are subject to the risk that  in one or more markets  our marketing system could be found not to be in compliance with applicable regulations 
the failure of our direct selling system to comply with such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business in a particular market or in general 
we are also subject to the risk of private party challenges to the legality of our direct selling system 
the regulatory requirements concerning direct selling systems do not include bright line rules and are inherently fact based 
an adverse judicial determination with respect to our direct selling system  or in proceedings not involving us directly but which challenge the legality of other direct selling marketing systems  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
on april  the ftc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking which  if implemented  will regulate all sellers of business opportunities in the united states 
the proposed rule would  among other things  require all sellers of business opportunities  which would likely include the company  to i implement a seven day waiting period before entering into an agreement with a prospective business opportunity purchaser  and ii provide all prospective business opportunity purchasers with substantial information in writing at the beginning of the waiting period regarding the business opportunity  including information relating to representations made as to the earnings experience of other business opportunity purchasers  the names and telephone numbers of recent purchasers in their geographic area  cancellation or refund policies and requests within the prior two years  certain legal actions against the company  its affiliated companies and company officers  directors  sales managers and certain others 
the direct selling association 
table of contents the dsa and other interested parties have filed over  comments with the ftc that are publicly available regarding the proposed rule through the ftc s website at http www 
ftc 
gov os comments businessopprule index 
htm 
the dsa and other interested parties also filed rebuttal comments with the ftc in september  based on information currently available  we anticipate that the final rule may require several years to become final and effective  and may differ substantially from the rule as originally proposed 
nevertheless the proposed rule  if implemented in its original form  would negatively impact our business in the united states 
product regulations the formulation  manufacturing  packaging  labeling  distribution  importation  sale and storage of certain of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies  including the food and drug administration fda  the federal trade commission the ftc  the consumer product safety commission and the united states department of agriculture and by various agencies of the states  localities and foreign countries in which our products are manufactured  distributed and sold 
failure by our distributors or us to comply with those regulations could lead to the imposition of significant penalties or claims and could materially and adversely affect our business 
in addition  the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may adversely affect the marketing of our products  resulting in significant loss of sales revenues 
on march   the us food and drug administration the fda proposed a new regulation to require current good manufacturing practices cgmps  affecting the manufacture  packing  and holding of dietary supplements 
the proposed regulation would establish standards to ensure that dietary supplements and dietary ingredients are not adulterated with contaminants or impurities  and are labeled to accurately reflect the active ingredients and other ingredients in the products 
it also includes proposed requirements for designing and constructing physical plants  establishing quality control procedures  and testing manufactured dietary ingredients and dietary supplements  as well as proposed requirements for maintaining records and for handling consumer complaints related to cgmps 
we are evaluating this proposal with respect to its potential impact upon the various contract manufacturers that we use to manufacture our products  some of whom might not meet the new standards 
product claims  advertising and distributor activities our failure to comply with ftc or state regulations  or with regulations in foreign markets that cover our product claims and advertising  including direct claims and advertising by us  as well as claims and advertising by distributors for which we may be held responsible  may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or otherwise materially and adversely affect the distribution and sale of our products 
distributor activities in our existing markets that violate applicable governmental laws or regulations could result in governmental or private actions against us in markets where we operate 
given the size of our distributor force  we cannot assure that our distributors would comply with applicable legal requirements 
transfer pricing and similar regulations in many countries  including the united states  we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned by our united states or local entities and are taxed accordingly 
in addition  our operations are subject to regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of customs duties are assessed on the importation of our products 
our principal domicile is the united states 
under tax treaties  we are eligible to receive foreign tax credits in the united states for taxes paid abroad 
as our operations expand outside the united states  taxes paid to foreign taxing authorities may exceed the credits available to us  resulting in the payment of a higher overall effective tax rate on our worldwide operations 
we have adopted transfer pricing agreements with our subsidiaries to regulate inter company transfers  which agreements are subject to transfer pricing laws that regulate the flow of funds between the subsidiaries and the parent corporation for product purchases  management services  and contractual obligations  such as the payment of distributor compensation 
in  we implemented a foreign holding and operating company structure for our non united states businesses 
this new structure re organized our non united states subsidiaries in the cayman islands 
though our goal is to improve the overall tax rate  there is no assurance that the new tax structure could be successful 
if the united states internal revenue service or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge these agreements  plans  or arrangements  or require changes in our transfer pricing practices  we could be required to pay higher taxes  interest and penalties  and our earnings would be adversely affected 

table of contents we believe that we operate in compliance with all applicable transfer pricing laws and we intend to continue to operate in compliance with such laws 
however  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with transfer pricing laws  or that those laws would not be modified  which  as a result  may require changes in our operating procedures 
taxation relating to distributors our distributors are subject to taxation  and in some instances legislation or governmental agencies impose an obligation on us to collect the taxes  such as value added taxes  and to maintain appropriate records 
in addition  we are subject to the risk in some jurisdictions of being responsible for social security and similar taxes with respect to our distributors 
other regulations we are also subject to a variety of other regulations in various foreign markets  including regulations pertaining to employment and severance pay requirements  import export regulations and antitrust issues 
our failure to comply or assertions that we fail to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business in a particular market or in general 
to the extent we decide to commence or expand operations in additional countries  government regulations in those countries may prevent or delay entry into or expansion of operations in those markets 
in addition  our ability to sustain satisfactory levels of sales in our markets is dependent in significant part on our ability to introduce additional products into the markets 
however  government regulations in both our domestic and international markets can delay or prevent the introduction  or require the reformulation or withdrawal  of some of our products 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could lower our revenue and net income 
in  approximately of our revenue was recorded by subsidiaries located outside of north america 
revenue transactions and related commission payments  as well as other incurred expenses  are typically denominated in the local currency 
accordingly  our international subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
the results of operations of our international subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during consolidation since we translate into us dollars using the average exchanges rates for the period 
as exchange rates vary  revenue and other operating results may differ materially from our expectations 
additionally  we may record significant gains or losses related to foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents and the re measurement of inter company balances 
we believe that our foreign currency exchange rate exposure is somewhat limited since the hong kong dollar is pegged to the us dollar 
we also purchase all inventories in us dollars 
our foreign currency exchange rate exposure  mainly to korean won  singapore dollar  new taiwan dollar  japanese yen  mexican peso  chinese yuan  and australia dollar  represented approximately of our revenue in our foreign currency exchange rate exposure would significantly increase if the hong kong dollar were no longer pegged to the us dollar 
given our inability to predict the degree of exchange rate fluctuations  we cannot estimate the effect these fluctuations may have upon future reported results  product pricing or our overall financial condition 
further  to date we have not attempted to reduce our exposure to short term exchange rate fluctuations by using foreign currency exchange contracts 
failure of new products to gain distributor and market acceptance could harm our business 
an important component of our business is our ability to develop new products that create enthusiasm among our distributor force 
if we fail to introduce new products on a timely basis  our distributor productivity could be harmed 
in addition  if any new products fail to gain market acceptance  are restricted by regulatory requirements  or have quality problems  this would harm our results of operations 
factors that could affect our ability to continue to introduce new products include  among others  limited capital resources  government regulations  proprietary protections of competitors that may limit our ability to offer comparable products and any failure to anticipate changes in consumer tastes and buying preferences 
system failures could harm our business 
because of our diverse geographic operations and our internationally applicable distributor compensation plans  our business is highly dependent on efficiently functioning information technology systems provided by marketvision 
the marketvision systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fires  earthquakes  telecommunications failures  computer viruses and worms  software defects and other events 
they are also subject to break ins  sabotage  acts of vandalism and similar misconduct 
despite precautions implemented by the staff of marketvision  problems could result in interruptions in services and materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations

the company offers a limited number of products under its nht global brand see item our principal products 
our premium noni juice  skindulgence  alura and la vie products each account for a significant portion of our total sales and  together  account for a significant majority of our total sales 
if demand for any of these four products decreases significantly  government regulation restricts the sale of these products  we are unable to adequately source or deliver these products  or we cease offering any of these products for any reason without a suitable replacement  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely effected 
we do not manufacture our own products so we must rely on independent third parties for the manufacturing and supply of our products 
all of our products are manufactured by independent third parties 
there is no assurance that our current manufacturers will continue to reliably supply products to us at the level of quality we require 
in the event any of our third party manufacturers become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in required volumes and quality levels at acceptable prices  we will be required to identify and obtain acceptable replacement manufacturing sources 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain alternative manufacturing sources or be able to do so on a timely basis 
an extended interruption in the supply of our products will result in a substantial loss of sales 
in addition  any actual or perceived degradation of product quality as a result of our reliance on third party manufacturers may have an adverse effect on sales or result in increased product returns and buybacks 
the high level of competition in our industry could adversely affect our business 
the business of marketing personal care  cosmetic  nutraceutical  and lifestyle enhancement products is highly competitive 
this market segment includes numerous manufacturers  distributors  marketers  and retailers that actively compete for the business of consumers both in the united states and abroad 
the market is highly sensitive to the introduction of new products  which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market 
sales of similar products by competitors may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to significant competition for the recruitment of distributors from other direct selling organizations  including those that market similar products 
many of our competitors are substantially larger than we are  offer a wider array of products  have far greater financial resources and many more active distributors than we have 
our ability to remain competitive depends  in significant part  on our success in recruiting and retaining distributors through an attractive compensation plan and other incentives 
we believe that our compensation and incentive programs provide our distributors with significant earning potential 
however  we cannot be sure that our programs for recruitment and retention of distributors would be successful 
terrorist attacks  acts of war  epidemics or other communicable diseases or any other natural disasters may seriously harm our business 
terrorist attacks  or acts of war or natural disasters may cause damage or disruption to our company  our employees  our facilities and our customers  which could impact our revenues  expenses and financial condition 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  and other acts of war or hostility  such as the chinese objection to the taiwan independence movement and its resultant tension in the taiwan strait  could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations  and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict 
additionally  natural disasters less severe than the indian ocean tsunami that occurred in december may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations

on february   the seoul central district court ruled against lxk and fined it a total of million korean won approximately  at december  
lxk also incurred related costs of million korean won approximately  at december  as a result of the judgment

lxk has filed an appeal of this ruling with the korean supreme court 
the company has been unable to determine with certainty that it will not be subject to the fine of million korean won if the appeal is unsuccessful  and will therefore continue to reserve million korean won approximately  at december

subsidiaries controlled by the company sell personal care  wellness  and quality of life products under the nht global brand to an independent distributor network that either uses the products themselves or resells them to consumers 
prior to june   the company marketed its nht global branded products under the name  lexxus international 
as of december   the company is conducting business in at least countries through approximately  active distributors 
we consider a distributor active if they have placed at least one product order with us during the preceding year 
although we have experienced significant revenue growth in prior years due in part to our efforts to expand into new markets  we do not intend to devote material resources to opening any additional foreign markets in our priority for is to progress further on developing the chinese market 
in  we generated approximately of our revenue from outside north america  with sales in hong kong representing approximately of revenue 
because of the size of our foreign operations  operating results can be impacted negatively or positively by factors such as foreign currency fluctuations  and economic  political and business conditions around the world 
in addition  our business is subject to various laws and regulations  in particular regulations related to direct selling activities that create certain risks for our business  including improper claims or activities by our distributors and potential inability to obtain necessary product registrations 
effective december   the company entered into a stock purchase agreement with bannks foundation bannks  a lichtenstein foundation and owner of of the common shares of kgc networks pte ltd 
kgc  a singapore corporation  pursuant to which the company sold to bannks  common shares representing the company s of the outstanding shares of capital stock of kgc for a total cash purchase price of  at the same time and as a condition of the sale  the company entered into a separate agreement pursuant to which kgc is obligated to pay to the company monthly payments of approximately  each  including interest at  to settle an outstanding inter company payable in the amount of approximately million and to pay for inventories ordered and partially delivered totaling approximately  as well as the company s undertaking to continue to supply kgc with certain products for a period of at least months 
the company discounted the monthly payments based on its cost of capital and recorded the receivable at million 
given its interest in the retained profits and cumulative translation adjustment of kgc of approximately  the company recognized a nominal gain on sale 
since the receivable from kgc is unsecured  the company recorded a reserve totaling million  which is reduced as payments are received 
as of december   kgc is current on all monthly payments due  and as such  the company reversed  of the reserve 
kgc sells the company s products into a separate network of independent distributors located primarily in russia and other eastern european countries 
upon the effective date of the transactions above  the company no longer consolidates the financial statements of kgc 
the company does not believe these transactions result in a discontinued operation as the company will continue to supply kgc with a significant amount of product for the foreseeable future

table of contents china is currently the company s most important business development project 
new direct selling legislation was adopted in december  while multi level marketing was banned in november by the government in china 
before the formal adoption of direct selling laws  many of the international direct selling companies started to operate in china in a retail format 
in june  nht global obtained a license to engage in retail business in china 
the license stipulates a capital requirement of million over a three year period  including a million initial payment the company made in january in december  the company submitted a preliminary application for a direct selling license and fully capitalized its chinese entity with the million cash infusion 
in june  the company submitted a final application package 
in  and  approximately  and of our revenue  respectively  was generated in hong kong 
most of the company s hong kong revenues are derived from the sale of products that are delivered to members in china 
after consulting with outside professionals  the company believes that our hong kong e commerce business does not violate any applicable laws in china even though it is used for the internet purchase of our products by buyers in china 
but the government in china could  in the future  officially interpret its laws and regulations or adopt new laws and regulations to prohibit some or all of our e commerce activities with china and  if our members engage in illegal activities in china  those actions could be attributable to us 
on april   an investigative television program was aired in china with respect to the operations of the company s hong kong subsidiary and the representative office located in beijing 
among other things  the television program alleged that our hong kong operations engaged in fraudulent activities and sold products without proper permits 
in response  the company sent a member of management to china to investigate and manage what was happening in china 
prior to that time  the company did not have any management personnel in china 
among other things  the individual determined that the company should be proactive in demonstrating that alleged illegal acts of individual members were not the acts of the company itself and that the company intended to invest in china for the long term 
accordingly  the company took the following steps the company set up a school in macau to train members about the applicable chinese legal requirements and the need for distributors to accurately and fairly describe business opportunities available to potential members 
the schools were operated from may to november the company suspended shipment of product to certain members until they had completed the required training 
the company extended its existing day return policy in hong kong to days to allow distributors and customers who purchased products during the two week period prior to  and the two week period after  the airing of the television program to return purchased merchandise for a full refund 
the company began posting announcements on its hong kong website to the effect that the resale of its products in china without the appropriate license would result in termination of membership 
since then  the company has terminated at least four members in china for engaging in activities in violation of chinese law 
in june the company completed formation of its chinese subsidiary nht global china  and by the end of had invested million as capital in that entity 
nht global china is working to file an application for a direct selling license under proposed legislation 
nht global china has leased space in zhuhai  purchased equipment and finished out a manufacturing facility 
although nht global china now has a license to manufacture and employee personnel  it does not yet have a license to sell any product manufactured there and will not begin manufacturing operations until it has obtained that license 
on november   nht global china obtained its general cosmetic manufacturing permit and has begun trial production testing 
there have been other isolated cases of misconduct by our members in china 
we make efforts to be informed of and in compliance with applicable laws in china  and we have not received any official notice that we are or may be acting improperly or illegally  and we continue our efforts to maintain regular contact with officials in all levels of government 
in september  a person delegation from the zhuhai government made a point of visiting our offices in dallas  texas as part of an economic development tour to the united states 
the company is unable to predict whether it will be successful in obtaining a direct selling license to operate in china  and if it is successful  when it will be permitted to commence direct selling operations there 
further  even if the company is successful in 
table of contents obtaining a direct selling license to do business in china  it is uncertain as to whether the company will generate profits from such operations 
between april and december  the company s hong kong subsidiary engaged a service provider to facilitate product importation into china and act  or engage another party to act  as the importer of record 
the individual that owns that service provider was one of the directors of nht global china 
the company believes that the amount of duty paid to chinese customs on the imported goods by the importer of record was paid at the negotiated rate 
however  there can be no assurance that chinese customs will not elect  in the future  to examine the duty paid  and if they conduct such examination  they may conclude that the valuation established was insufficient  resulting in an underpayment of duties 
as a consequence  the importer of record could be required to pay additional duties and possible penalties to chinese customs 
additional duties could range between zero and million  plus penalties 
the extreme worst case was calculated using the highest possible assessment to the highest possible declared value and assuming that negotiated valuation practices do not apply 
the company believes that any such future assessment of additional duties or penalties would be made against and become the responsibility of the importer of record 
there can be no assurance that the company or its subsidiaries would not also be assessed with such liability in the event that the importer of record is unable to pay all or part of such amount 
income statement presentation the company derives its revenue from sales of its products  sales of its enrollment packages  and from shipping charges

on march   the amortization of fees charged by the company s third party software service provider 
cost of sales also includes purchasing costs  receiving costs  inspection costs and warehousing costs 
distributor commissions are our most significant expense and are classified as an operating expense 
under our compensation plan  distributors are paid weekly commissions in the distributor s home country  in their local currency  for product sold by that distributor s down line distributor network across all geographic markets 
distributors are not paid commissions on purchases or sales of our products made directly by them 
this seamless compensation plan enables a distributor located in one country to sponsor other distributors located in other countries where we are authorized to do business 
currently  there are two fundamental ways in which our distributors can earn income through retail markups on sales of products purchased by distributors at wholesale prices  and through a series of commissions paid on product purchases made by their down line distributors 
each of our products carries a specified number of sales volume points 
commissions are based on total personal and group sales volume points per sales period 
sales volume points are essentially based upon a percentage of a product s wholesale cost 
to be eligible to receive commissions  a distributor may be required to make nominal monthly purchases of our products 
certain of our subsidiaries do not require these nominal purchases for a distributor to be eligible to receive commissions 
in determining commissions  the number of levels of down line distributors included within the distributor s commissionable group increases as the number of distributorships directly below the distributor increases 
distributor commissions are dependent on the sales mix and  for  represented of net sales 
from time to time we make modifications and enhancements to our compensation plan to help motivate distributors  which can have an impact on distributor commissions 
from time to time we also enter into agreements for business or market development  which may result in additional compensation to specific distributors 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of administrative compensation and benefits including stock based compensation  travel  credit card fees and assessments  professional fees  certain occupancy costs  depreciation and amortization  and other corporate administrative expenses 
in addition  this category includes selling  marketing  and promotion expenses including costs of distributor conventions which are designed to increase both product awareness and distributor recruitment 
because our various distributor conventions are not always held at the same time each year  interim period comparisons will be impacted accordingly 
provision for income taxes depends on the statutory tax rates in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we implemented a foreign holding and operating company structure for our non united states businesses effective december  this structure re organized our non united states subsidiaries into the cayman islands 
though our goal is to improve the overall tax rate  there is no assurance that the new tax structure will be successful 
if the united states internal revenue service or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge these agreements  plans  or arrangements  or require changes in our transfer pricing practices  we could be required to pay higher taxes  interest and penalties  and our earnings would be adversely affected 
critical accounting policies in response to sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies and sec release number  commission statement about management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the company has identified certain policies and estimates that are important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as both those that are material to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and as those that require management s most subjective judgments 
these policies and estimates require the application of significant judgment by the company s management 
the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of the company s financial statements include estimates associated with obsolete inventory and the fair value of acquired intangible assets  including goodwill  and other long lived assets  as well as those used in the determination of liabilities related to sales returns  distributor commissions  and income taxes 
various assumptions and other factors prompt the determination of these significant estimates 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account historical experience and current and expected economic conditions 
the actual results may differ materially and adversely from the company s estimates 
to the extent that there are material differences between the estimates and actual results  future results of operations will be affected 
the company s critical accounting policies at december  include the following 
table of contents inventory valuation 
the company reviews its inventory carrying value and compares it to the net realizable value of its inventory and any inventory value in excess of net realizable value is written down 
in addition  the company reviews its inventory for obsolescence and any inventory identified as obsolete is reserved or written off 
the company s determination of obsolescence is based on assumptions about the demand for its products  product expiration dates  estimated future sales  and management s future plans 
also  if actual sales or management plans are less favorable than those originally projected by management  additional inventory reserves or write downs may be required 
the company s inventory value at december  was approximately million  net of reserve of million 
the company recorded a reserve for obsolete inventory of approximately  in primarily related to coffee pods used in the gourmet coffee caf tm coffee machines 
additional reserve of million was recorded in to write down inventory to its net realizable value due to declining sales  particularly in mexico and japan  and the discontinuation of the gourmet coffee caf tm product line 
valuation of intangible assets and other long lived assets 
the company has adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
at december   goodwill of approximately million was reflected on the company s balance sheet 
no impairment of goodwill has been identified in any of the periods presented 
the company reviews the book value of its property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
during  the company determined that it was in its best interest to abandon its japan distributor gallery 
as a result  an impairment charge of million was recorded for certain furniture and fixture  office equipment  and leasehold improvements 
also during  the company recorded an impairment charge of  for its acquired distributor database 
these charges are included as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
at december   the net book value of the company s property and equipment and intangible assets were approximately million and million  respectively 
allowance for sales returns 
an allowance for sales returns is provided during the period the product is shipped 
the allowance is based upon the return policy of each country  which varies from days to one year  and their historical return rates  which range from approximately to approximately of sales 
sales returns are approximately and of sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the allowance for sales returns was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
no material changes in estimates have been recognized for the year ended december  revenue recognition 
product sales are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to independent distributors 
product sales to distributors are made pursuant to a distributor agreement that provides for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier that completes delivery to the distributors  which is commonly referred to as fob shipping point 
the company primarily receives payment by credit card at the time distributors place orders 
the company s sales arrangements do not contain right of inspection or customer acceptance provisions other than general rights of return 
amounts received for unshipped product are recorded as deferred revenue 
such amounts totaled approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
shipping charges billed to distributors are included in net sales 
costs associated with shipments are included in cost of sales 
during april  the company launched a new product line  gourmet coffee caf tm  which consisted of coffee machines and the related coffee and tea pods  in the north american market 
as the gourmet coffee caf tm was a very different product than the company s other products and no reliable information on the company s sales returns or warranty obligation existed  the company deferred all revenue generated from the sale of coffee machines and the related coffee and tea pods until sufficient return and warranty experience on the product was established 
the deferral totaled approximately million and million in revenue and related costs  respectively  for product shipped through december  the deferred costs were recorded in other current assets  as the sales return period for north american distributors is only for one year 
during  the company recognized revenue of million since the sales return period had substantially expired and the estimated additional sales returns were considered insignificant 
upon revenue recognition  the company also recorded the related cost of sales and distributor commissions of million and million  respectively 
also during  the company decided to discontinue sales of gourmet coffee caf tm product and recorded a charge of million to cost of sales for its remaining inventories 
enrollment package revenue  including any nonrefundable set up fees  is deferred and recognized over the term of the arrangement  generally twelve months 
during the third quarter of  the company changed its amortization methodology from a 
table of contents monthly method to the preferred daily method whereby revenues for each enrollment package start the day of enrollment 
the change in methodology resulted in additional deferred revenue of approximately  during enrollment packages provide distributors access to both a personalized marketing website and a business management system 
prior to the acquisition of marketvision communications corp 
marketvision on march   the company paid marketvision a fixed amount in exchange for marketvision creating and maintaining individual web pages for such distributors 
these payments to marketvision were deferred and recorded as a prepaid expense 
the related amortization was recorded to cost of sales over the term of the arrangement 
the remaining unamortized costs were included in the determination of the purchase price of marketvision 
subsequent to the acquisition of marketvision  no upfront costs are deferred as the amount is nominal 
costs associated with shipments are included in cost of sales 
at december   enrollment package revenue totaling million was deferred
