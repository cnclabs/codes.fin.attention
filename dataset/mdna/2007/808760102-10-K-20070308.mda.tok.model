item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations overview we develop and distribute the fast forword family of software 
our patented products build learning capacity by rigorously and systematically applying neuroscience based learning principles to improve the fundamental cognitive skills required to read and learn 
extensive outcomes research by independent researchers  our founding scientists  school districts and our company demonstrates the rapid and lasting gains achieved through fast forword participation 
our products are marketed primarily to k schools in the us  to whom we sell through a direct sales force 
to facilitate the use of our products  we offer a variety of on site and remote professional and technical services  as well as phone  email and web based support 
since our inception  learners have used almost  of our products and approximately  schools have purchased at least  of our fast forword product licenses and services 
as of december  we had full time employees  compared to at december  business highlights we market our fast forword products primarily as a reading intervention solution for struggling  at risk  english language learners  and special education students 
students who test as below basic in reading make up approximately of the million student population in the us 
while our installed base is growing  the  schools that have purchased at least  of our product licenses and services represent a small fraction of the nearly  public k schools in the us 
sales of our products are included in the growing supplemental education materials segment of the overall education materials market 
the supplemental materials segment of that market is estimated at billion  with average annual growth rate of since the education materials market is expected to continue to grow  driven by a continuing slow increase in the number of pre k students  growing federal accountability requirements and a continuing increase in current expenditures per student 
federal education funds are a critical resource in helping school districts address the needs of the most challenged learners 
we believe that a significant proportion of our sales are funded by federal sources  particularly title one and idea special education 
in fiscal  the federal government appropriated billion to state grants for special education and million to title one grants to local education agencies 
company highlights in total booked sales increased by compared to as k booked sales were up see booked sales and selling activity below 
this compares to a decrease of in compared to we attribute our k booked sales increase primarily to our improved sales capacity resulting from additional sales representatives hired in who became productive in an increased focus within our sales organization on quickly closing transactions over  an improved purchasing environment in key states  especially texas  florida  louisiana and mississippi 
in  the gulf coast regions of these states were impacted by severe weather that disrupted school operations 
in addition  texas in particular experienced serious state funding uncertainty 
these factors  together with instability in energy prices generally  were diminished in the contribution from new products released in late and we also saw growth in our international sales  which increased over in compared to in  international sales comprised approximately of total sales 
we conduct our international business through value added resellers vars 
at december   we had vars selling in countries 
one of our major goals continues to be increasing the number of large booked sales  typically expansions of existing implementations  which we believe to be an important indicator of mainstream education industry acceptance and an important factor in the productivity of our sales force 
in  we closed transactions in excess of  compared to in and in larger booked sales tend to have a longer sales cycle and involve a more complex decision process 
increases in the proportion of our business from these large booked sales may cause page increased fluctuations and unpredictability in the timing of our booked sales and revenue 
as previously discussed  the characteristics of our public school market cause us to have a somewhat long and unpredictable sales cycle 
in our booked sales were million and our revenue was million 
revenue in grew compared to in contrast to our increase in total booked sales 
our revenue of million was substantially higher than booked sales of million 
historically  booked sales have been greater than revenue 
the divergence of booked sales and revenue in fiscal was primarily attributable to our december strategic pricing change 
as a result of this strategic pricing change  we began to recognize revenue for most sales of perpetual licenses up front  rather than ratably over the related support period 
therefore  in   we recognized substantial revenue both from sales booked in and and from sales booked in in booked sales were million and revenue was million 
in we expect revenue to increase in the range of to 
our long term growth target is in the range of to 
we reported net income of million in  compared to net income of million in this decrease in net income results from higher costs  primarily due to the implementation of fas r and increases in incentive compensation and commissions due to the higher booked sales 
we expect to report net income in 
we ended with million in cash and cash equivalents  and had no outstanding debt 
we did not make use of our credit line during net cash generated from operating activities was million 
results of operations revenues year ended december  dollars in thousands change change products    service and support    total revenues    revenue compared to product revenue declined in compared to because we recognized approximately million less revenue from sales made in prior periods 
this decrease was almost offset by increased revenue recognized on sales booked in on average of booked sales in were recognized into revenue in the quarter in which the sale occurred 
service and support revenue increased in by  primarily due to stronger sales of on site services  partially offset by a lower level of revenue recognized from sales made in prior years 
service and support revenue also reflected the increase in the number of schools purchasing ongoing progress tracker access and support contracts 
we had more customers on support at december  than at december revenue compared to the increase in product revenue primarily reflected our december pricing change that eliminated the initial license fee for our progress tracker online product 
this change in our pricing structure resulted in a far higher proportion of booked sales from a given period in being recognized into revenue in the period in which the sale was booked than in for the year ended december   approximately million  or  of total booked sales were recognized as revenue in the quarter in which the sale occurred 
for the comparable periods in  a negligible amount of booked sales was recognized into revenue in the quarter of sale 
our december strategic pricing change had little impact in  because the software for many december perpetual licenses was not delivered until january the impact on january revenue from products shipped in december was approximately million 
service and support revenues increased  primarily due to increased sales of on site services 
service and support revenue also increased as a result of the increase in the number of schools purchasing ongoing progress tracker access and support booked sales and selling activity booked sales is a non gaap financial measure that management uses to evaluate current selling activity 
we believe that booked sales is a useful metric for investors as well as management because page it is the most direct measure of current demand for our products and services 
booked sales equals the total value net of allowances of software  services and support invoiced in the period 
revenue on a gaap basis is recorded for booked sales when all four of the requirements for revenue recognition have been met  if any of the requirements to recognize revenue are not met  the sale is booked to deferred revenue 
we use booked sales information for resource allocation  planning  compensation and other management purposes 
we believe that revenue is the most comparable gaap measure to booked sales 
however  booked sales should not be considered in isolation from revenue  and is not intended to represent a substitute measure of revenue or any other performance measure calculated under gaap 
the following reconciliation table sets forth our booked sales  revenues and change in deferred revenue for the twelve months ended december   and year ended december  dollars in thousands change change booked sales    less revenue    net increase decrease in deferred revenue    total deferred revenue end of period   booked sales in the k sector  which accounted for of booked sales in  increased to million compared to million in booked sales in the k sector were million in we believe that the principal reasons for our increase in booked sales are our improved sales capacity resulting from additional sales representatives hired in who became productive in an increased focus within our sales organization on quickly closing transactions over  an improved purchasing environment in key states  especially texas  florida  louisiana and mississippi 
in  the gulf coast regions of these states were impacted by severe weather that disrupted school operations 
in addition  texas in particular experienced serious state funding uncertainty 
these factors  together with instability in energy prices generally  were diminished in the contribution from new products released in late and we believe large booked sales are an important indicator of mainstream education industry acceptance and an important factor in reaching our goal of increasing sales force productivity 
in we continued to focus our sales force on multi site sales 
the number of booked sales over  increased to in from in and in for the year ended december   of our k booked sales were realized from sales over  for the comparable periods ending december  and  large booked sales accounted for and of booked sales respectively 
fiscal  and included booked sales from a single large contract with the school district of philadelphia 
the total contract value was million  with million booked in and an additional million booked in each of fiscal and the remaining million is scheduled to be recorded as booked sales in the coming two years 
large booked sales include volume discounts but the percentage discount applicable to any given transaction will vary and the relative percentage of large sales and smaller sales in a given quarter may fluctuate 
because we discount product license fees but do not discount service and support fees  product booked sales and revenue are disproportionately affected by discounting 
we cannot predict the size  number and timing of large transactions in the future 
booked sales outside the k market primarily private practice clinicians and international customers were flat in relative to  compared to a increase in over we expect booked sales in this market to be near the current level in and may even experience modest growth due to increased booked sales to international customers 
our primary focus remains the us k market 
page although federal  state and local budget pressures make for an uncertain funding environment for our customers  we are optimistic about our growth prospects in the k market 
however  achieving our booked sales growth objectives will depend on increasing customer acceptance of our products  which requires us to continue to focus on improving our products ease of use  their fit with school requirements  and our connection with classroom teachers and administrators 
our k growth prospects are also influenced by factors outside our control including the overall level  certainty and allocation of state  local and federal funding 
for a discussion of some of the other important factors that affect our results  see risk factors 
in addition  the revenue recognized from our booked sales can be unpredictable 
our various license and service packages have substantially differing revenue recognition periods  and it is often difficult to predict which license package a customer will purchase  even when the amount and timing of a sale can be reasonably projected 
see management s discussion and analysis application of critical accounting policies for a discussion of our revenue recognition policy 
in addition  the timing of a single large order or its implementation can significantly impact the level of booked sales and revenue at any given time 
gross profit and cost of revenues year ended december  dollars in thousands gross profit on products    gross profit margin on products gross profit on service and support    gross profit margin on services and support total gross profit    total gross profit margin the overall gross profit margin declined in compared to  as a small improvement in product margin was more than offset by a substantial decrease in services and support margin 
product margins improved primarily because capitalized software amortization  which was charged to product cost of revenue  ceased in june we also reduced costs by limiting the quantity of electronic media that we send to customers 
service and support margins have declined primarily due to our investment in a new support center in tucson  arizona  which replaced an outside vendor 
we also hired additional service staff in anticipation of increased service sales 
the overall gross profit margin improved in compared to  primarily because of a increase in services and support margin 
service and support margins improved from to as we increased the sales of services to our customers  significantly increased progress tracker revenues and maintained our support base 
due to the semi fixed cost nature of services and support  revenue growth resulted in margin improvement 
revenue mix in all recent years was similar  as we had of revenues from products in  versus in and in the remainder of revenues in each year was from services and support 
in  we expect that product revenues will comprise a similar percentage of revenues and that product margins will be comparable to however  because we are anticipating higher service and support revenues and we expect to see the benefits of our new support center  in we expect higher service and support margins and consequently higher overall gross profit margins than in page operating expenses year ended december  dollars in thousands change change sales and marketing    research and development    general and administrative    total operating expenses    operating expenses operating expenses increased million in compared to of this increase million relates to the net increase in stock based compensation expenses resulting from the adoption of fas r in million of stock based compensation expenses are included within operating expenses  whereas in we expensed  in stock based compensation 
million relates to increased commission expense due to higher sales activity 
million relates to increases in incentive compensation resulting from improved sales and cash flow performance in compared to approximately million relates to higher salaries and benefits charged to operating expenses due to increased headcount in the relevant departments  the above increases were partially offset by some cost reductions  primarily in accounting and audit costs 
sales and marketing in  our sales and marketing expenses increased over  primarily due to increased sales and marketing staff  more marketing activities and higher commissions reflecting higher booked sales 
commissions in were million higher than in in  our sales and marketing expenses grew less rapidly  because increases in sales and marketing staff and marketing activities were partially offset by lower commissions and incentive compensation which were  or million  lower than in as a result of lower booked sales 
sales and marketing expenses consist principally of salaries and incentive compensation paid to employees engaged in sales and marketing activities  travel costs  tradeshows  conferences  and marketing and promotional materials 
at december   we had field based quota bearing sales personnel selling to public schools  compared to and at december  and respectively 
we expect to continue to add sales people during and to continue to invest in marketing activities 
research and development research and development expenses increased by in due primarily to stock compensation expenses and patent acquisition legal fees  following a increase in which was mainly due to additional staff compensation expenses 
research and development expenses principally consist of compensation paid to employees and consultants engaged in research and product development activities and product testing  together with software and equipment costs 
we expect research and development expenses to increase modestly in as we continue to invest in improving our current product suite  demonstrating product efficacy and introducing new products 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased by in due primarily to stock compensation expenses and incentive compensation expenses  partially offset by a reduction in accounting and legal fees relating to the restatement of financial results that were expensed in accounting and legal fees associated with the restatement that were expensed in totaled approximately  general and administrative expenses increased in over primarily due to additional accounting staff and audit and tax fees  partially offset by a decline in incentive compensation 
general and administrative expenses principally consist of salaries and compensation paid to our executives  accounting staff and other support personnel  as well as travel expenses for these employees  and outside legal and accounting fees 
other income from related party in september  we signed an agreement with posit science corporation psc  transferring our patented technology to psc for use in the health field 
during the twelve months ended december   and we recorded   and  respectively  for royalties received and services provided to psc 
page amounts received to date and any future receipts are being reported as other income as we do not consider these royalties to be part of our recurring operations 
interest and other income expense  net year ended december  dollars in thousands change change interest and other income expense  net for  interest and other income expense  net  consisted primarily of interest earned on our invested cash of  and a reclassification of  of service and support revenue relating to two customers for whom we are no longer performing services 
in  interest and other income expense  net  comprised mainly interest earned on our invested cash of  and interest on officer loans of  all officer loans were repaid in full by march  for  interest and other income expense  net  consisted primarily of the amortization of deferred financing expenses of  partially offset by officer loan interest 
the amortization of deferred financing was completed in the third quarter of income tax provision benefit we have recorded tax provisions of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income tax provisions principally consist of federal and state taxes currently payable offset by the utilization of net operating losses resulting in an effective tax rate of and  respectively 
the effective rate increased in the year ended december  primarily due to the non deductibility of share based compensation expense for tax purposes and state income taxes resulting from additional state nexus 
we recorded a tax benefit of  for the year ended december  relating to the reversal of a provision for us federal alternative minimum tax for the year ended december  at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
unutilized net operating loss carryforwards will expire in the years through utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations 
previous or future equity transactions may result in such an ownership change 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before they become available to reduce future tax liabilities 
at december   we had approximately million of deferred tax assets  comprised primarily of net operating loss carryforwards 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance and previously reported net losses  at december  we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our remaining net deferred tax assets as they are not yet realizable 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  at december  there were no borrowings outstanding under our credit line 
net cash generated by operations in was million  compared to cash used by operations of million in and million generated by operations in overall  our receivable collection experience has remained strong throughout we collected million of receivables in  compared with million in and million in there were no payments for previously expensed restructuring charges for the twelve months ended december  or for the comparable period in the payments for previously expensed restructuring charges were million 
net cash generated by investing activities in was million  consisting of the maturity of short term investments of million and officer loan repayments of million  partially offset by property and equipment purchases of million 
during the year ended december   we purchased an enterprise wide customer relationship management system 
as of december   a net book value of  related to the purchase page and subsequent implementation of this system was included in property and equipment 
these costs will be depreciated over the initial estimated useful life of five years 
net cash generated by investing activities in was million  consisting of the purchase of million of short term investments and the purchase of hardware and software for million  which were more than offset by the repayment of million of officer loans 
net cash used in investing activities in was million consisting of the purchase of computer hardware and software 
financing activities generated million in  million in  and million in  each from the sale of stock upon option exercises and through purchases of stock through the employee stock purchase plan 
in  we borrowed and repaid million  resulting in no net activity 
there was no borrowing on our credit line in or because our booked sales tend to be seasonal  we may have negative cash flows in particular quarters  particularly the first quarter  when booked sales tend to be substantially lower than in other quarters 
we borrowed money for working capital purposes in the first quarter of and may borrow again from time to time 
no funds were borrowed in or we have a line of credit with comerica bank totaling million which expires june  the line is subject to limitations based on our quick ratio and tangible net worth 
borrowings under the line are subject to various covenants  which may limit our financial and operating flexibility 
in september we further amended the agreement to include a letter of credit sub limit not to exceed million 
at december   we have an outstanding letter of credit for  there were no other borrowings outstanding under the line at december  and we have no current intentions of borrowing any funds 
at december  we were in compliance with all our covenants 
we expect that cash flow from operations will continue to be our primary source of funds for the next several years 
again  this will require us to achieve certain levels of booked sales 
if we are unable to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow from operations  we may seek other sources of debt or equity financing  or may be required to reduce expenses 
reducing our expenses could adversely affect our operations by reducing the resources available for sales  marketing  research or development efforts 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations and commitments we have a non cancelable lease agreement for our corporate office facilities 
the minimum lease payment is approximately  per month through after the base lease payment increases at a compound annual rate of approximately 
the lease expires in december we also have a lease agreement for our tucson  arizona office through april at an average rent of approximately  per month for the period subsequent to january  we also make royalty payments to the institutions who participated in the original research that produced our initial products 
our minimum royalty payments are  per year 
the following table summarizes our obligations at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
and thereafter  page our purchase order commitments at december  are not material 
loans to current and former officers in march we made full recourse loans to certain of our officers  in amounts totaling million 
in some of these officers left our company 
the notes were secured by shares of our common stock owned by the current and former officers 
the loans bore interest at 
principal and interest were due december  during the twelve months ended december  we received million in loan repayments  including interest 
at december  there was a remaining balance due of  this represented principal and interest from one of the former officers 
during the first quarter of we received the balance due in the form of cash and stock 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  assumptions and judgments 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time 
the estimates  assumptions and judgments that we make can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our financial statements would be affected 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments pertaining to revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts are the most critical assumptions to understand in order to evaluate our reported financial results 
a detailed discussion of our use of estimates  assumptions and judgments as they relate to these polices is presented below 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from the sale of licenses to our software and from service and support fees 
software license revenue is recognized in accordance with aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position sop 
sop provides specific industry guidance and four basic criteria  which must be met to recognize revenue 
these are persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  a fixed or determinable fee  and the probability that the fee will be collected 
the application of sop requires us to exercise significant judgment related to our specific transactions and transaction types 
sales to our school customers typically include multiple elements eg  fast forword software licenses  progress tracker  our internet based participant tracking service  support  training  implementation management  and other services 
we allocate revenue to each element of a transaction based upon its fair value as determined in reliance on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  if vsoe exists for each element 
if we do not have vsoe for one or more delivered elements in an arrangement typically software  we recognize revenue using the residual method  whereby the difference between the total arrangement fee and the total fair value of the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue relating to the delivered elements 
vsoe of fair value for each element of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and  for support services  is also measured by the renewal price 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 
the value of software licenses  services and support invoiced during a particular period is recorded as deferred revenue until recognized 
all revenue from transactions that include new products that have not yet been delivered is deferred until the delivery of all products 
deferred revenue is recognized as revenue as discussed below 
product revenue product revenue is primarily derived from the licensing of software and is recognized as follows perpetual licenses software licensed on a perpetual basis 
revenue is recognized at the later of product delivery date or contract start date using the residual method 
if vsoe does not exist for all the undelivered page elements  all revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the service period if the undelivered element is services or when all elements have been delivered 
term licenses software licensed for a specific time period  generally three to twelve months 
revenue is recognized ratably over the license term 
individual participant licenses software licensed for a single participant 
revenue is recognized over the average period of use  typically six weeks 
service and support revenue service and support revenue is derived from a combination of training  implementation  technical and professional services  online services and customer support 
training  technical and other professional services are typically sold on a per day basis 
if vsoe exists for all elements of an arrangement or all elements except software licenses  services revenue is recognized as performed 
if vsoe does not exist for all the elements in an arrangement except software licenses  service revenue is recognized over the longest contractual period in an arrangement 
revenue from services sold alone or with support is recognized as performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses due to the inability of customers to make payments 
we adjust this allowance periodically based on our historical experience of bad debt write offs  which have been low in recent years 
cancellations and refunds are allowed in limited circumstances  and such amounts have not been significant 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance to reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to realize these assets 
stock based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate stock based compensation expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and expected life 
stock compensation expense may be adjusted in the future if actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our current estimates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the rate of interest that we earn on our cash and cash equivalents 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by from the market interest rates at december  would not have a material affect on our results of operations
