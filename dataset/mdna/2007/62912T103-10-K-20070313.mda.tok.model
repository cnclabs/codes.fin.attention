item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are an independent energy company focused on generating and developing natural gas prospects in appalachia and other unconventional basins with similar geologic characteristics 
we develop our prospects through our operating subsidiaries and our interests in sponsored drilling programs 
all of our direct and indirect subsidiaries are wholly owned 
we maintain a combined interest as both general partner and an investor in our drilling programs ranging from to  with additional reversionary interests after specified distribution thresholds are reached 
we account for those interests using the proportionate consolidation method  with all material inter company accounts and transactions eliminated on consolidation 
through our operating subsidiaries  we also control the gas gathering and transmission facilities for our core appalachian properties  providing deliverability directly from the wellhead to interstate pipelines serving major east coast natural gas markets  and we operate natural gas distribution facilities for two communities in kentucky 
results of operations and revenues 
the following table shows the components of our revenues for and  together with their percentages of total revenue in and percentage change on a year over year basis 

table of contents year ended december  of revenue change contract drilling oil and gas production gas transmission and compression total our revenue mix for reflects our ongoing strategy for transitioning to a production based business  with oil and gas sales accounting for of total revenues  compared to of total revenues in we expect this trend to continue as we execute our initiatives for long term production growth by expanding our infrastructure and acreage position in core fields  and accelerating our development of these properties through sponsored drilling programs 
contract drilling revenues reflect both the size and the timing of our drilling program financings 
although we receive the proceeds of these financings as customers drilling deposits under drilling contracts with our programs  we recognize revenues from drilling operations on the completed contract method as the wells are drilled  rather than when funds are received 
we participated in gross net wells in the fourth quarter of  and a total of gross net wells for the year as a whole 
during the first quarter of  most of the wells were drilled under our turnkey contracts with programs sponsored late in for our programs  we implemented a cost plus structure as part of our strategy for reducing exposure to price volatility in drilling services and supplies 
we also tailored these programs for tiered participation on a field wide basis  retaining program interests of in leatherwood development and from to for program initiatives in other fields 
two programs for development of our core appalachian fields were sponsored in the second half of the year  contributing to a significant ramp up in revenues from this sector 
with all of our turnkey obligations from prior programs fulfilled  we expect margins for this sector to stabilize from our ongoing cost plus drilling operations 
our growth in production revenues reflects an increase of in production volumes to  mmcfe in  with a decline in our average sales price of natural gas before certain transportation charges to per mcf 
our volumetric growth reflects added production from our interests in arkoma cdx wells acquired late in and from new wells brought on line in all our operating areas during  including wells connected in our leatherwood field during the year 
we anticipate ongoing volumetric growth as we continue to upgrade our infrastructure and bring our new wells in leatherwood and other key fields on stream 
principal purchasers of our production are gas marketers and customers with transmission facilities near our producing properties 
approximately of our natural gas production in was sold under fixed price contracts  and the balance primarily at prices determined monthly under formulas based on prevailing market indices 
gas transmission and compression revenues were driven by fees totaling  for moving third party gas through our ngas gathering system  which we acquired in march this component of revenues also reflects additional gas gathering and compression fees for moving third party leatherwood production through field wide facilities we completed late in  together with contributions of  in from gas utility sales and  from our minority interest in a limited liability company that owns and operates the gathering system servicing the arkoma cdx field 
expenses 
the following table shows the components of our direct and other expenses in and percentages listed in the table reflect margins for each component of direct expenses and percentages of total revenue for each component of other expenses

in  these expenses were of contract drilling revenues  compared to in the margins for this sector reflect our transition from turnkey to cost plus pricing for our new drilling programs  which we implemented in with a view to reducing our exposure to price volatility for drilling services  equipment and steel casing requirements 
we began to realize slight improvements in our margins for this sector in the second half of as we completed the transition to our plus pricing structure 
we expect these margins to stabilize from ongoing cost plus drilling program operations 
production expenses in were driven by our substantial growth in production volumes 
in addition to lifting costs  production expenses include field operating and maintenance costs  related overhead  third party transportation fees and lease operating expenses 
the increase in our production expenses was significantly offset by cost savings realized from ownership of the ngas gathering system acquired in march  eliminating transportation fees during the balance of the year for our share of leatherwood  straight creek and sme production delivered through the system 
as a percentage of oil and gas production revenues  our production expenses increased to in from in the prior year  primarily reflecting lower margins for non operated properties  lower gas sales prices and higher filed service costs 
gas transmission and compression expenses in were of associated revenues  compared to in the improvement in margins for this part of our business reflects substantial revenue growth from third party fees generated by the ngas gathering system acquired in march our gas transmission and compression expenses do not reflect our acquisition costs for that system or capitalized costs for extensions of our field wide gas gathering systems and additions to dehydration and compression capacity required to bring new wells on line 
in the fourth quarter of  we expensed part of our capitalized exploratory well costs for a project we began late in to test the new albany shale formation on acquired tracts in the illinois basin  with an impairment charge of  in the carrying value of our position 
we also recognized a fourth quarter writedown of  for impairment of non operated properties in polk county  texas 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses primarily reflect the timing and extent of our selling and promotional costs for sponsored drilling programs 
on a year over year basis  sg a expenses also reflect higher costs for supporting expanded operations as a whole  including additions to our staff and technology infrastructure as well as increased salary and other employee related expenses 
non cash charges for options  warrants and deferred compensation reflect the fair value method of accounting for employee stock options  which we adopted in under this method  employee stock options are

we also recognized an accrual of  for deferred compensation cost 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a is recognized under the units of production method  based on the estimated proved developed reserves of the underlying oil and gas properties and on a straight line basis over the useful life of other property and equipment 
the increase in dd a charges reflects substantial additions to our oil and gas properties  gas gathering systems and related equipment  including our acquisition of the ngas gathering transmission system for million in march it also reflects a fourth quarter adjustment to reflect a substantial increase in our depletion rate for interest expense in increased from the addition of million in convertible debt at the end of and higher overall bank borrowings  primarily to support our acquisition costs of million for cbm assets in the arkoma at the end of  million for the purchase of our ngas gathering system early in and capitalized costs of approximately million for extensions and enhancements of our field wide gas gathering systems throughout the year 
the gain of  on the sale of assets in was generated primarily from two strategic transactions 
the first transaction was a sale of our overriding royalty interests under a farmout for properties we operate in harlan county  kentucky and lee county  virginia 
we had acquired these interests  together with related participation and pipeline capacity rights  for million earlier in the year  and received million for the sale of the royalty interests 
in the second transaction  completed in the fourth quarter  we sold our oil and gas lease position in the williston basin for million  resulting in a gain of approximately million 
we had assembled the position under a leasing program we initiated in at the time of the sale  our williston position aggregated  gross  net areas 
income tax expense recognized in represents future tax liability at the operating company level 
we have no current tax liability due to the utilization of intangible drilling costs idc allocated from our active drilling programs

these investments were funded in part with net cash of  from financing activities  comprised primarily of proceeds from convertible note financings of  in the first quarter and  in the fourth quarter of  as well as the exercise of outstanding warrants and options throughout the year 
financing activities also reflect the repayment of our credit facility during the fourth quarter of as a result of these activities  net cash increased to  at december  from  at december  as of december   we had a working capital deficit of  this reflects wide fluctuations in our current assets and liabilities from the timing of customers deposits and expenditures under drilling contracts with our sponsored programs 
since these fluctuations are normalized over relatively short time periods  we generally do not consider working capital to be a reliable measure of liquidity 
the working capital deficit at the end of is not expected to have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in future periods 

table of contents capital resources 
our business involves significant capital requirements 
the rate of production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted 
without successful development activities  our proved reserves would decline as oil and gas is produced from our proved developed reserves 
our long term performance and profitability is dependent not only on developing existing oil and gas reserves  but also on our ability to find or acquire additional reserves on terms that are economically and operationally advantageous 
to fund our ongoing reserve development and acquisition activities  we have relied on a combination of cash flows from operations  bank borrowings and private placements of our convertible notes and equity securities  as well as participation by outside investors in our sponsored drilling programs 
in december  we completed an institutional private placement of our convertible notes due december  in the aggregate principal amount of million 
we also issued warrants in the transaction  which expired unexercised in august at december   all of the notes remained outstanding but were recorded at  reflecting an initial allocation of  for their equity components  which was ratably accreted by  in  along with  reallocated to debt upon expiration of the warrants 
the notes are convertible by their holders into our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustments for certain dilutive issuances of common stock 
if a holder elects to convert a note before the second anniversary of the issuance date  unless the prevailing market price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price  the holder will be entitled to a payment equal to the difference between two years interest on the converted note and the interest already paid on the note  payable at our option in cash or in common shares 
after that date  if the prevailing market price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price  we may redeem any unconverted notes at a redemption price equal to their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
upon any event of default or any change of control  the notes are redeemable at the option of the holders in cash at a default rate equal to of their principal amount or at a change of control rate equal to the greater of of their principal amount or of the consideration that would be received by the holder for the underlying shares in the change of control transaction 
any notes that are neither redeemed nor converted prior to maturity will be repayable in cash or in common shares 
any common shares issued for interest payments on converted notes or upon redemption at their maturity will generally be valued for that purpose at of their prevailing market price 
in september  we entered into a credit agreement with keybank national association  as agent and primary lender 
the credit agreement provides us with a senior secured revolving credit facility that replaces our prior credit facility with keybank  which had a scheduled maturity date of july  and a borrowing base of million 
the new facility has a five year maturity for revolving term loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to million  with a current borrowing base of million 
the facility is secured by liens on our interests in most of our appalachian wells 
outstanding borrowings under the facility bear interest at fluctuating rates ranging from to above quoted libor rates  depending on the amount of borrowing base utilization  plus commitment fees ranging from to of the unused borrowing base 
as of december  our outstanding borrowings under the facility aggregated million  and the interest rate amounted to our ability to repay our bank debt and convertible notes will be subject to our future performance and prospects as well as market and general economic conditions 
we will likely be dependent on additional financings to repay our outstanding long term debt at maturity 
our future revenues  profitability and rate of growth will continue to be substantially dependent on the demand and market price for natural gas 
future market prices for natural gas will also have a significant impact on our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity  to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms and to continue attracting investment capital for drilling programs 
the market price for natural gas is subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand  market uncertainty and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control 
we expect our cash reserves  cash flows from operations and anticipated borrowing base availability under our credit facility to provide adequate working capital to meet our short term capital expenditure objectives 
to fully realize our financial goals for growth in revenues and reserves  we will continue to be dependent on the capital markets or other financing alternatives as well as continued participation by investors in future drilling programs 

table of contents forward looking statements some statements made by us in this report are prospective and constitute forward looking statements with in the meaning of private litigation reform act of other than statements of historical fact  all statements that address future activities  outcomes and other matters we plan  expect  budget  intend or estimate and other similar expressions are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
among other things  these include uncertainty about estimates of future natural gas production  increases in the cost of drilling  completion and gas collection or other costs of developing our reserves  unavailability of drilling rigs and services  uncertainty of production costs and estimates of required capital expenditures  drilling  operational and environmental risks  commodity price fluctuations  regulatory changes and litigation risks  and uncertainties in estimating proved oil and gas reserves  projecting future rates of production and timing of development and remedial expenditures 
if the assumptions we use in making forward looking statements prove incorrect or the risks described in this report occur  our actual results could differ materially from future results expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
financial market risk interest rate risk 
borrowing under our secured credit facility bear interest at fluctuating market based rates 
accordingly  our interest expenses are sensitive to market changes  which exposes us to interest rate risk on current and future borrowing under the facility 
foreign market risk 
we sell our products and services exclusively in the united states and receive payment solely in united states dollars 
as a result  our financial results are unlikely to be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we are parties to leases for office facilities and various types of equipment 
we are also obligated to make payments at specified times and amounts under instruments governing our long term debt and other commercial commitments 
the following table lists our minimum annual commitments as of december  under these instruments

related party transactions because we operate through subsidiaries and affiliated drilling programs  our corporate structure causes various agreements and transactions in the normal course of business to be treated as related party transactions 
it is our policy to structure any transactions with related parties only on terms that are no less favorable to the company than could be obtained on an arm s length basis from unrelated parties 
significant related party transactions are summarized in notes and to the consolidated financial statements and related disclosure included elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including evaluations of any allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment of long lived assets 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these evaluations form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
although actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  management believes that its estimates are reasonable and that actual results will not vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
the following critical accounting policies relate to the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts when deemed appropriate to reflect losses that could result from failures by customers or other parties to make payments on our trade receivables 
the estimates of this allowance  when maintained  are based on a number of factors  including historical experience  aging of the trade accounts receivable  specific information obtained on the financial condition of customers and specific agreements or negotiated amounts with customers 
impairment of long lived assets 
our long lived assets include property and equipment and goodwill 
long lived assets with an indefinite life are reviewed at least annually for impairment  while other long lived assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying values of these assets are not recoverable 
we recognized impartment charges totaling  in the fourth quarter of for suspended exploratory well costs of  charged to expense and for abandonment of non operated properties with a carrying value of  item a quantitative disclosure about market risk none
