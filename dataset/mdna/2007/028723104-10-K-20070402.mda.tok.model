table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the accompanying financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our future plans  estimates  beliefs and expected performance 
the forward looking statements are dependent upon events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  market prices for natural gas and oil  economic and competitive conditions  regulatory changes  estimates of proved reserves  potential failure to achieve production from development projects  capital expenditures and other uncertainties  as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly in item a 
risk factors and the cautionary note regarding forward looking statements  all of which are difficult to predict 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed may not occur 
overview we focus our oil and natural gas exploration  exploitation and developmental operations on projects located in the rocky mountain region of the united states 
we have funded our operations with a combination of cash received from the sale of our equity  cash flow generated from oil and gas operations  and from proceeds received from the sale of certain of our oil and gas assets 
we intend to increase stockholder value by profitably growing reserves and production  primarily through drilling operations 
our company began oil and gas operations in january  with the purchase of interests in undeveloped acreage from two private companies  denver  colorado based tower colombia corporation tcc and casper  wyoming based north finn llc 
in april  we completed a merger with tcc and we currently retain a strategic alliance with north finn 
we currently own interests in approximately  gross  net acres primarily in the powder river basin of wyoming and in the williston basin of north dakota 
during  we commenced initial drilling in our krejci project  located in wyoming and in our goliath project  located in north dakota 
we also continued drilling in our fetter project  located in wyoming 
we expect that we will continue to drill in these areas through  in order to best understand the optimum drilling  completion and stimulation methods to use in our attempt to produce oil and natural gas in an economic fashion 
in addition to focusing on drilling within our existing projects  we expect to continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our project portfolio 
we have not yet begun to establish meaningful reserves or cash flow 
however  we believe that our existing project portfolio provides us with the opportunity to rapidly grow reserves and cash flow if we are able to prove that our acreage positions can be developed in a commercial fashion 
a number of unprofitable wells may need to be drilled while we test various drilling  completion and stimulation methods 
we have been able to reduce or eliminate our financial exposure in the initial drilling in our projects by creating joint ventures arrangements that provide for others to pay for all or a disproportionate share of the initial drilling costs 
this has allowed us to move forward in drilling a greater number of wells than if we were to drill these wells on our own 
we expect to continue to use industry relationships to partially or completely fund initial drilling 

table of contents within the main focus areas of our existing project portfolio  we expect the following drilling activity  and our share of the cost of that drilling activity to occur in expected approximate expected net project wells working interest capital required in millions fetter project converse county  wy a krejci project niobrara county  wy goliath project williams county  nd total drilling activity a as a result of our participation agreement with red technology alliance  as further explained in item properties  we will have no capital exposure in the drilling or completion of these wells 
we expect that our projected capital expenditures relating to our oil and gas drilling operations  general and administrative expenses and other oil and gas related activities such as land and lease costs and geological costs  will require us to access additional capital in although there is no assurance that we will be able to access additional capital  additional capital may come from the sale of debt and or equity instruments  or from the sale of certain oil and gas assets 
we may expand or reduce our capital expenditures depending on our available capital 
we have not entered into any commodity derivative arrangements or hedging transactions 
although we have no current plans to do so  we may enter into commodity swap and or hedging transactions in the future in conjunction with oil and gas production 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
liquidity and capital resources we do not currently generate meaningful cash flow from our oil and natural gas operating activities  although our future depends on our ability to generate oil and natural gas operating cash flow 
we recognize that net cash generated from operating activities is a function of production volumes and commodity prices  both of which are inherently volatile and unpredictable  as well as operating efficiency and capital spending 
our business is a depleting one in which each barrel of oil equivalent produced must be replaced or our asset base and capacity to generate revenues in the future will shrink 
our primary cash requirements are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties 
we have historically funded our oil and natural gas activities primarily through the sale of our equity  from the sale of certain of our oil and gas assets and to a lesser extent  internally generated cash flows 
due to our active oil and natural gas activities  we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  substantial working capital requirements 
we currently anticipate capital requirements in to be approximately million 
approximately million is allocated to our expected drilling and production activities which include million to be used for drilling new wells within our main focus areas  million is allocated to land  and geological and geophysical activities  and million relates to our general and administrative expenses 
we intend to fund these capital expenditures  other commitments and working capital requirements with existing capital  funds raised from the sale of our equity and to a lesser extent  expected cash flow from operations 
we do not expect to fund our oil and gas operations with debt unless and until we generate sufficient cash flow from oil and natural gas operations to service the debt 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million consisting primarily of short term money market investments  as compared to million at december  working capital was million as of december   as compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities cash flows provided used by operating activities were million  million and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the significant increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december  compared to was primarily due to higher oil and gas production revenue relating to our big sky project  and the decrease from to occurred due to our sale of our big sky project in march of net cash used in investing activities our oil and natural gas operations are extremely capital intensive and we invest a substantial portion of our available capital in our drilling  acquisition  land and geophysical activities 
as a result  we used million during relating to our oil and natural gas operations  and we used  primarily for the acquisition of furniture and equipment relating to our office move in we offset these amounts by selling oil and gas assets for approximately million  so our net capital used in investing activities for was  capital 
table of contents expenditures of million were attributable to the drilling of gross wells  of which were apparently successful 
other spending included million primarily attributable to land holdings and capitalized g a 
during the year ended december   we used million in investing activities 
capital expenditures of million were attributable to the drilling of gross wells  of which were apparently successful 
other spending included million attributable to land holdings 
 of capital expenditures were associated with computer hardware  office furniture and equipment 
during the year ended december   we used million in investing activities 
capital expenditures of million were attributable to the drilling of gross wells  all of which were successful 
other spending included million in expenditures primarily attributable to land holdings 
the expenditures were partially offset by sales proceeds of million from the sale of our interests in a coalbed methane project 
net cash provided by financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities totaled  for the year ended december  which amount came from the exercise of warrants and options 
for the year ended december   cash flows provided by financing activities totaled million 
we received million in net proceeds from the sale of our series aa convertible preferred stock and received  from the exercise of common stock warrants exercised in for the year ended december   cash flows provided by financing activities totaled million 
we received million in proceeds from the sale of common stock and received  from common stock warrants exercised in results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  we recorded net income attributable to common stockholders of  per common share  basic and diluted for the year ended december   as compared to net income attributable to common stockholders of

oil and gas operations for the year ended december   we recorded total oil and gas revenues of  compared with  for the year ended december  the primary reason for the revenue decline is the sale on march  of our interest in the big sky producing property that accounted for substantially all of our revenues in and through march  oil and gas sales and production costs are summarized in the table that follows

as a service fee under an october agreement with mab resources to receive a  finder s fee upon successfully assisting mab resources in acquiring additional montana lease acreage that was not suitable for our acreage portfolio 
we subsequently converted the  note into  shares of gsl common stock at per share  which was subsequently exchanged on may for  shares of unregistered shares in common stock of publicly held petrohunter energy corp 
otcbb phun 
we did not generate any service fee income during the year ended december  general and administrative expenses we recorded million and million in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  and december   respectively 
the primary differences is million recorded for the year ended december  pursuant to our january  adoption of fas r share based payments  an increase in salaries and salaries related expense of  which results from increasing the number of full time employees hired to support our expanding oil and gas operations  from eight employees at december   to thirteen employees at december   and an increase in accounting and audit related expenses of  due to our implementation of controls and procedures required pursuant to sarbanes oxley 
impairments for the year ended december   we recorded an impairment against our evaluated oil and gas properties in the amount of million 
a substantial portion of the impairment occurred during the fourth quarter and results from being unable to complete the fetter project state well in a fashion as originally planned  which reduced the estimate of proved reserves as of december  for the well 
we did not record any impairment for the year ended december  
table of contents gain on sale of oil and gas properties we recorded million in gains from the sale of oil and gas properties million after tax effect during the year ended december  the reconciliations of the gains on the sales are as follows big sky bear creek goliath totals contract sales price effective date adjustments adjusted sales price allocated capitalized costs using the relative fair market value method required under full cost accounting recognized gains on sales of oil and gas properties we did not record any gain from the sale from oil and gas properties during the year ended december  investment income we recorded  and  in investment income for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we typically invest our excess cash in short term investments and money market accounts 
the increase in investment income results from a higher excess cash balance and from higher interest rates in over income taxes for the year ended december   we recorded a  provision for deferred income taxes and recorded a  provision for the year ended december  the  provision reflects a projected effective deferred tax rate for the effective rate is lower than the statutory rate due primarily to percentage depletion in excess of cost depletion 
preferred dividends for the year ended december   we recorded million from dividends attributable to our outstanding series aa convertible preferred stock  which was outstanding for the full year 
for the year ended december   we recorded  in preferred dividends attributable to our outstanding series aa convertible preferred stock  which was represents dividends payable from july  through december  and from our then outstanding series a convertible preferred stock

table of contents oil and gas operations for the year ended december   we recorded total oil and gas revenues of  compared with  for the year ended december  the increase in revenue is attributable to our participation in successful wells drilled during in our big sky project  which we sold in march oil and gas sales and production costs are summarized in the table that follows 
year ended december  oil sold barrels average oil price oil revenue gas sold mcf average gas price gas revenue total oil and gas revenues less lease operating expenses less oil gas amortization expense less accretion of discount less impairments producing revenues less direct expenses less intangible asset amortization less depreciation of office facilities less general and administrative expenses income loss from operations total barrels of oil equivalent boe sold lease operating expense per boe sold amortization expense per boe sold general and administrative expenses 
during and  we recorded general and administrative expenses in the amount of million and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses results from increased costs associated with our merger with tower colombia corporation  and from continued expanding operations to support our oil and gas operations 
our payroll related expenses increased by approximately  from to due to the addition of new employees 
our accounting related expenses increased by approximately  which was related primarily to design and implementation of controls over financial reporting pursuant to sarbanes oxley 
we incurred a management fee of  prior to the merger with tower colombia corporation  and paid an additional  for fees directly related to the merger 
we paid  for listing fees related to the listing of our common stock on the american stock exchange 
our directors related expenses increased by  due to the value assigned to shares that vested during on behalf of one of our directors 
the remaining increase is primarily attributable to increases in investor relations expenses  rent and travel expenses 
income taxes 
a deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to i nols and ii existing temporary differences between book and taxable income 
realization of net deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period available under tax law 
for the year ended december   we recorded a  income tax provision consisting entirely of deferred income taxes 
for the year ended december   we recorded no income tax provision  having cumulative losses for both financial and income tax reporting 
the  deferred tax provision for equate to approximately a effective tax rate on the net income of  this is significantly below the federal statutory rate primarily due to reversal in of the  valuation allowance on the december  deferred tax asset 
the  deferred income tax liability at december  is due primarily to a  deferred tax liability recorded in the acquisition of tower colombia corporation in a non taxable merger 

table of contents preferred dividends 
we are obligated to pay an dividend on our series aa convertible preferred stock 
for the year ended december   we incurred  in dividends in conjunction with this obligation  and in dividends associated with our now retired  series a preferred stock 
during  we reflected  in dividends associated with our now retired  series a preferred stock 
critical accounting policies and estimates full cost accounting method we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration  development and estimated abandonment costs  including certain related employee costs and general and administrative costs less any reimbursements for such costs  incurred for the purpose of acquiring and finding oil and gas are capitalized 
unevaluated property costs are excluded from the amortization base until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves on the respective property or impairment 
we review our unevaluated properties at the end of each quarter to determine whether the costs should be reclassified to the full cost pool and thereby subject to amortization 
sales of oil and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to the net full cost pool with no gain or loss recognized  unless the adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
we amortize our investment in oil and gas properties through dd a using the units of production method 
under the units of production method  the quarterly provision for dd a is computed by dividing production volumes for the period by the total proved reserves as of the beginning of the period  and applying the respective rate to the net cost of proved oil and gas properties  including future development costs 
we capitalize the portion of salaries  general and administrative expenses that are attributable to our acquisition  exploration and development activities 
under the full cost method of accounting  we compare  at the end of each financial reporting period  the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves based on period end hedge adjusted commodity prices and excluding cash flows related to estimated abandonment costs  to the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties  net of related deferred taxes 
this comparison is referred to as a ceiling test 
if the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties exceed the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves  we are required to write down the value of our oil and gas properties to the value of the discounted cash flows 
revenue recognition we record revenues from the sales of natural gas and oil when in the month that delivery to the customer has occurred and title has transferred 
this occurs when natural gas or oil has been delivered to a pipeline or a tank lifting has occurred 
we receive payment from one to three months after delivery 
at the end of each month  we estimate the amount of production delivered to purchasers and the price we will receive 
variances between our estimated revenue and actual payment are recorded in the month the payment is received 
however  differences have been insignificant 
natural gas imbalances we may have an interest with other producers in certain properties  in which case we use the sales method to account for natural gas imbalances 
under this method  revenue is recorded on the basis of natural gas we actually sell 
in addition  we may record revenue for our share of natural gas sold by other owners that cannot be volumetrically balanced in the future due to insufficient remaining reserves 
we also reduce revenue for other owners natural gas we sell that cannot be volumetrically balanced in the future due to insufficient remaining reserves 
our remaining over and under produced gas balancing positions are considered in our proved reserves 
as of december  and our produced natural gas volumes were in balance 
asset retirement obligation our accounting for asset retirement obligations is governed by sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement requires us to record our estimate of the fair value of liabilities related to future asset retirement obligations in the period the obligation is incurred 
asset retirement obligations relate to the 
table of contents removal of facilities and tangible equipment at the end of an oil and gas property s useful life 
the adoption of sfas no 
requires the use of management s estimates with respect to future abandonment costs  inflation  market risk premiums  useful life and cost of capital 
as required by sfas no 
 our estimate of our asset retirement obligations does not give consideration to the value the related assets could have to other parties 
income taxes income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently payable plus deferred income taxes related to certain income and expenses recognized in different periods for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when assets are recovered or settled 
deferred income taxes are also recognized for tax credits that are available to offset future income taxes 
deferred income taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax rates to the differences between financial statement and income tax reporting 
we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards  the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and natural gas prices 
stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  which revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we adopted the provisions of the new standard effective january  prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we used the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb opinion no 
and the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
we recorded non cash stock based compensation of million   and  in  and  respectively 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets  which requires all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities be initially measured at fair value 
sfas no 
permits  but does not require  the subsequent measurement of servicing assets and servicing liabilities at fair value 
adoption is required as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after september  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a benefit recognition model with a two step approach  a more likely than not recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
if it is not more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on its technical merits  no benefit will be recorded 
fin also requires that the amount of interest expense to be recognized related to uncertain tax positions be computed by applying the applicable statutory rate of interest to the difference between the tax position recognized in accordance with fin and the amount previously taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the change in net assets as a result of applying this pronouncement will be considered a change in accounting principle  with the cumulative effect of the change treated as an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings or goodwill  if allowed under existing accounting standards  in the period of transition 
fin is effective as of january  and we are currently evaluating the effects  if any  that fin will have on our financial statements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab provides guidance on the consideration of effects of the prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
under sab  registrants must quantify errors using 
table of contents both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
sab was effective for us as of december   and the adoption did not have an impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the standard also gives expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas no 
does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas no 
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop fair value assumptions 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  early adoption is encouraged 
we are currently assessing the impact  if any  that sfas no 
will have on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
we do not have postretirement plans 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas no 
applies to all entities and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  adoption of sfas no 
is not required for these financial statements and we are currently determining the impact  if any  that sfas no 
will have on our future financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk because of our relatively low level of current oil and gas production  we are not exposed to a great degree of market risk relating to the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
however  our ability to raise additional capital at attractive pricing  our future revenues from oil and gas operations  our future profitability and future rate of growth depend substantially upon the market prices of oil and natural gas  which fluctuate widely 
we expect commodity price volatility to continue 
we do not currently utilize hedging contracts to protect against commodity price risk 
as our oil and gas production grows  we may manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price declines by entering into oil and natural gas price hedging arrangements to secure a price for a portion of our expected future oil and natural gas production 
operating cost risk we have experienced rising operating costs which impacts our cash flow from operating activities and profitability 
we recognize that rising operating costs could continue and continued rising operating costs would negatively impact our oil and gas operations
