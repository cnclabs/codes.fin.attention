audit committee independent investigation and restatement background in august  the division of enforcement of the united states securities and exchange commission the sec initiated an inquiry into certain of our accounting and financial reporting matters and requested that we provide certain documents 
over the course of several months  we produced documents and provided information in response to the sec s initial request and subsequent requests 
in june  the sec sent us an additional request for documents and information that appeared to expand the scope of the inquiry  with respect to both issues and periods 
as documents and information were collected in response to this additional request  our management was made aware of information that raised significant accounting and financial reporting concerns  including whether accruals  reserves  and other balance sheet items had been recorded and reported properly 
after evaluating this information and in consultation with pricewaterhousecoopers llp  our independent registered public accounting firm  management determined that the identified issues warranted an independent investigation and recommended such to the audit committee of our board of directors 
on august   the audit committee  acting on management s recommendation  approved the initiation of an independent investigation 
the audit committee engaged willkie farr gallagher llp willkie farr to lead the investigation as independent legal counsel to the audit committee 
willkie farr in turn engaged kpmg llp kpmg to serve as its independent forensic accountants 
scope of the investigation the scope of the investigation was determined by willkie farr  in consultation with the audit committee and kpmg 
the investigation involved a program of forensic analysis and inquiry directed to aspects of our accounting and financial reporting practices throughout the world  and evaluated aspects of our historical accounting and financial reporting practices since fiscal and  with respect to certain issues  prior fiscal years 
willkie farr and kpmg assembled an investigative team that ultimately consisted of more than professionals  including more than lawyers and accountants 
investigative teams were deployed in our three geographic regions americas including our corporate functions  emea  and apj 
information and documents were gathered from company personnel worldwide 
using proprietary search software  the investigative team evaluated over five million documents 
investigative counsel also conducted over interviews of approximately individuals  and the kpmg accountants  in connection with their forensic work  conducted numerous less formal discussions with various company employees 
in addition  using a proprietary software tool designed to identify potentially questionable journal entries based on selected criteria for example  entries made late in the quarterly close process  entries containing round dollar line items between million and million  and liability to liability transfers  kpmg selected and reviewed in excess of  journal entries that were highlighted by the tool or specifically identified by the forensic teams investigating specific issues 

table of contents summary of investigation findings the investigation raised questions relating to numerous accounting issues  most of which involved adjustments to various reserve and accrued liability accounts  and identified evidence that certain adjustments appear to have been motivated by the objective of attaining financial targets 
according to the investigation  these activities typically occurred in the days immediately following the end of a quarter  when the accounting books were being closed and the results of the quarter were being compiled 
the investigation found evidence that  in that timeframe  account balances were reviewed  sometimes at the request or with the knowledge of senior executives  with the goal of seeking adjustments so that quarterly performance objectives could be met 
the investigation concluded that a number of these adjustments were improper  including the creation and release of accruals and reserves that appear to have been made for the purpose of enhancing internal performance measures or reported results  as well as the transfer of excess accruals from one liability account to another and the use of the excess balances to offset unrelated expenses in later periods 
the investigation found that sometimes business unit personnel did not provide complete information to corporate headquarters and  in a number of instances  purposefully incorrect or incomplete information about these activities was provided to internal or external auditors 
the investigation identified evidence that accounting adjustments were viewed at times as an acceptable device to compensate for earnings shortfalls that could not be closed through operational means 
often  these adjustments were several hundred thousand or several million dollars  in the context of a company with annual revenues ranging from billion to billion and annual net income ranging from billion to billion for the periods in question 
the errors and irregularities identified in the course of the investigation revealed deficiencies in our accounting and financial control environment  some of which were determined to be material weaknesses  that require corrective and remedial actions 
for a description of the control deficiencies identified by management as a result of the investigation and our internal reviews described below  as well as management s plan to remediate those deficiencies  see part ii item a controls and procedures 
other company identified adjustments concurrently with the investigation  we also conducted extensive internal reviews for the purpose of the preparation and certification of our fiscal and prior financial statements and our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting 
our procedures included expanded account reviews and expanded balance sheet reconciliations to ensure all accounts were fully reconciled  supported  and appropriately documented 
we also implemented improvements to our quarterly and annual accounting close process to provide for more complete review of the various business unit financial results 
these additional reviews identified issues involving  among other things  revenue recognition in connection with sales of third party software  amortization of revenue related to after point of sale extended warranties  and accounting for certain vendor reimbursement agreements 
restatement as a result of issues identified in the audit committee investigation  as well as issues identified in the additional reviews and procedures conducted by management  the audit committee  in consultation with management and pricewaterhousecoopers llp  our independent registered public accounting firm  concluded on august  that our previously issued financial statements for fiscal    and including the interim periods within those years  and the first quarter of fiscal  should no longer be relied upon because of certain accounting errors and irregularities in those financial statements 
accordingly  we have restated our previously issued financial statements for those periods
