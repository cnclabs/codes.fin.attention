risk factors 
overview we were founded in and pioneered the development of satellite based digital radio service  commonly known as digital audio radio service dars 
our vision was to offer on an international basis a variety and quality of international  national and regional radio programming not available from am and fm broadcasters through low cost portable and mobile radio receivers owned by customers 
we were the first company to establish an operational dars system and today are the only licensed dars provider outside of north america  south korea and japan 
through the end of december  we have spent approximately billion in connection with the development and launch of our business 
our infrastructure is a fully operational system consisting of three main elements two geostationary satellites  afristar fuel life until and asiastar fuel life until the end of  the associated ground systems that provide content to and control the satellites  and the receivers owned by our customers 
our broadcast coverage area encompasses the most densely populated parts of asia  including india and china  all of africa and the middle east and most of western europe 
each of our satellites can service three large geographic areas through three beams capable of carrying up to channels 
given our global coverage and licensing position  we are in a position to roll out our subscription service on a sequential basis in the markets we find the most attractive  subject to obtaining any required local regulatory approvals 
our initial focus was rolling out our services in india  and securing the required licenses and approvals in western europe and china to launch dars in those markets 
we began the full roll out of our service in india in and a significant majority of our marketing dollars and execution has been focused on india since that time 
our highlights include the following addition of about  new subscribers during the year  which include over  new subscribers in india  thereby growing our global subscriber base to over  subscribers at december   including approximately  subscribers in india 
recently acquired exclusive radio rights for live cricket coverage for south asia and the middle east including our primary market in india through february worldspace would broadcast over days of cricket of which a minimum of days will feature all of the indian cricket team s overseas tours except for the icc cricket world cup in march april 
secured a license to deploy a terrestrial repeater network for launching satellite radio services in italy  bahrain and united arab emirates 
continued progress on the development of newer generation technologies and products for rolling out fully mobile services to automobiles and homes using a hybrid satellite terrestrial repeater network 
implementation of an enterprise wide resource planning application to support subscriber growth  accounting and reporting 
currently  our value proposition to our subscribers is driven by our ability to provide a compelling variety of high quality content that those living in our markets cannot receive from any other sources in a ubiquitous  cost 
table of contents effective and user friendly manner 
our programming includes a wide variety of international  national and regional music  news and entertainment channels  most of which is delivered commercial free 
we currently offer prepaid subscription packages in india for approximately rs 
 for six months and rs  per year  a monthly subscription package in africa and the middle east for per month and a premium package aimed at us and uk expatriates living throughout our current broadcast area for per month 
we no longer sell a month subscription package for approximately rs 
in india 
our goals for include the securing of licenses or approvals in india and europe and to be in a position to launch our services in china by we are also in the process of developing a hybrid dars in order for which we plan to establish in terrestrial repeater networks in india subject to securing the licenses and frequency authorizations required to operate terrestrial repeaters and the middle east 
through our hybrid dars  we expect to provide services to automobiles and to improve the reliability of our service in urban areas 
we expect to introduce new receiver products in different markets targeted at stratified market segments 
summary operating metrics the key metrics we use to monitor our business growth and our operational results are ending subscribers  average monthly subscription revenue per subscriber arpu  subscriber acquisition cost sac  cost per gross addition cpga and ebitda presented as follows twelve months ended december  net subscriber additions india rest of world row total eop subs india row arpu arpu india arpu row sac sac india sac row cpga cpga india cpga row ebitda in thousands average monthly subscription revenue per subscriber arpu please see further discussion under average monthly subscription revenue per subscriber under managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations sac please see further discussion under subscriber acquisition cost under managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and results of operations cost of services cpga please see further discussion under cost per gross addition under managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations operating expense ebitda we refer to net loss before interest income  interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization as ebitda 
ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
we believe ebitda is often a useful measure of a company s operating performance and is a significant basis used by our management to measure the operating performance of our business 
because we have funded and completed the build out of our system through the raising and expenditure of 
table of contents large amounts of capital  our results of operations reflect significant charges for depreciation  amortization and interest expense 
ebitda  which excludes this information  provides helpful information about the operating performance of our business  apart from the expenses associated with our physical plant or capital structure 
ebitda is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in our industry  although our measure of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
ebitda does not purport to represent operating loss or cash flow from operating activities  as those terms are defined under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to those measurements as an indicator of our performance 
row eop subs includes approximately  subscribers from a contract with kie which terminated on january  twelve months ended december  reconciliation of net loss to ebitda in thousands net loss as reported addback non ebitda items included in net loss interest income interest expense depreciation amortization income taxes benefit ebitda critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions which we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant management estimates and judgments used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from subscribers consists of subscription fees and non refundable activation fees 
we recognize subscription fees as our service is provided to a subscriber 
we record deferred revenue for prepaid subscription fees and amortize these prepayments to revenue ratably over the term of the respective subscription plan 
activation fees are recognized ratably over the estimated term of the subscriber relationship 
promotions and discounts are treated as an offset to revenue during the period of promotion 
sales incentives  consisting of discounts to subscribers  offset earned revenue 
management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors 
however  past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore reserves for doubtful accounts may increase as a percentage of accounts receivable and sales 
our current policy is not to accept product returns but if in the future  we were to accept product returns that are not covered under the manufacturers warranty  a sales return allowance will be established based on the guidance provided under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when a right of return exists and staff accounting bulletin  topic a b 

table of contents evaluation of satellites and other long lived assets for impairment and satellite insurance coverage we assess the recoverability of our long lived assets pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the costs of specific satellites are grouped together with other associated assets when assessing recoverability 
periodically  and when a change in circumstances occurs  this group of assets is compared with the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by us from the related satellites 
any excess of the net book value for this group of assets over the expected future undiscounted cash flows of the related satellite would result in an impairment charge that would be recorded in our statement of operations in the period the determination is made 
the impairment charge would be measured as the excess of the carrying value of the group of assets over the present value of estimated expected future cash flows related to the asset group using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period 
estimated future cash flows could be impacted by  among other things changes in estimates of the useful life of the satellite  changes in estimates of our ability to operate the satellite at expected levels  changes in the manner in which the satellite is to be used  and the loss of one or several significant customer contracts for capacity on the satellite 
if an impairment loss was indicated  such amount would be recognized in the period of occurrence  net of any insurance proceeds to be received so long as such amounts are determinable and receipt is probable 
depreciable satellite lives we calculate depreciation on a straight line basis over a ten year period 
as the communications industry is subject to rapid technological change and our satellites have been subject to certain anomalies  we may be required to revise the estimated useful lives of our satellites and communications equipment or to adjust their carrying amounts 
accordingly  the estimated useful lives of our satellites are periodically reviewed using current engineering data 
if a significant change in the estimated useful lives of our satellites is identified  we would account for the effects of such changes on depreciation expense on a prospective basis 
reductions in the estimated useful lives of our satellites would result in additional depreciation expense in future periods and may necessitate acceleration of planned capital expenditures in order to replace or supplement the satellite earlier than planned 
if the reduction in the estimated useful life of a satellite results in undiscounted future cash flows for the satellite  which are less than the carrying value of the satellite  an impairment charge would be recorded

our annual provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involve a significant amount of management judgment and are based on the best information available at the time 
we believe that we have recorded adequate liabilities and reviewed those balances on a quarterly basis 
judgment is also applied in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance is established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
realization of our deferred tax assets may depend upon our ability to generate future taxable income  which is dependent upon our ability to successfully introduce and market our product  general economic conditions  competitive pressures  and other factors beyond management s control 
valuation of inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value using the first in  first out fifo method of accounting 
inventories primarily consist of satellite radio receivers manufactured to our specifications by independent third parties 
we periodically evaluate inventory levels on hand as to potential obsolescence based on current and future selling prices 
currently  we do not provide our customers with a right of return  and are covered under manufacturer s original warranty  and hence no provisions have been made for such purpose 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas no

pre production design and development costs the company entered into agreements with vendors to reimburse certain costs related to pre production design and development of new receiver models

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb emerging issues task force issued eitf no 
 how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation  which states that a company should disclose its accounting policy ie  gross or net presentation regarding presentation of taxes within the scope of this issue 
if taxes included in gross revenues are significant  a company should disclose the amount of such taxes for each period for which an income statement is presented 
the consensus would be effective for the first annual or interim reporting period beginning after december  the disclosures are required for annual and interim financial statements for 
table of contents each period for which an income statement is presented 
the company will adopt this interpretation effective january  based on the company s current evaluation of this issue  the company does not expect the adoption of eitf no 
to have a significant impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
this statement shall be effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after december  the company will adopt this interpretation effective january  the company has not determined the effect  if any  the adoption of fin will have on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in september  the securities and exchange commission sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
sab expresses the sec staff s views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements 
these interpretations were issued to address diversity in practice and the potential under current practice for the build up of improper amounts on the balance sheet 
sab expresses the sec staff s view that a registrant s materiality evaluation of an identified unadjusted error should quantify the effects of the error on each financial statement and related financial statement disclosures and that prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab also states that correcting prior year financial statements for immaterial errors would not require previously filed reports to be amended 
such correction may be made the next time the registrant files the prior year financial statements 
registrants electing not to restate prior periods should reflect the effects of initially applying the guidance in sab in their annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after november  the cumulative effect of the initial application should be reported in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that fiscal year and the offsetting adjustment should be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that year 
registrants should disclose the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected in the cumulative adjustment 
the disclosure should also include when and how each error arose and the fact that the errors had previously been considered immaterial 
the sec staff encourages early application of the guidance in sab for interim periods of the first fiscal year ending after november  there was no material impact on the company s financial statements due to the adoption of sab in september  the financial accounting and standards board has issued fas  fair value measurements sfas  which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the standard also responds to investors requests for more information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value and the effect that fair value measurements have on earnings 
sfas will apply whenever another standard requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the standard does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  of sfas on its results of operations and financial position 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement permits  but does not require  entities to measure many financial instruments at fair value 
the objective is to provide entities with an opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
entities electing this option will apply it when the entity first recognizes an eligible instrument and will report unrealized gains and losses on such instruments in current earnings 
this statement applies to all entities  specifies certain election dates  can 
table of contents be applied on an instrument by instrument basis with some exceptions  is irrevocable and applies only to entire instruments 
with respect to sfas  available for sale and held to maturity securities at the effective date are eligible for the fair value option at that date 
if the fair value option is elected for those securities at the effective date  cumulative unrealized gains and losses at that date shall be included in the cumulative effect adjustment and thereafter  such securities will be accounted for as trading securities

the obligation will be reduced by any future payments made under the royalty agreement and will remain on our balance sheet until  the last year payment under the royalty agreement is required 
we are not required to pay this obligation in full  payments are based on a of ebitda each year and cannot be determined at this time 
future operating liquidity and capital resource requirements based upon our current plans  we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to cover our estimated funding needs for at least our financial projections are based on assumptions which we believe are reasonable but contain significant uncertainties 
we currently intend to use existing cash reserves mainly to execute our business plans and for satisfying certain terms of convertible note restructuring discussed in note n subsequent events  convertible note restructuring 
we expect that the majority of our cash outflow during year would be directed towards sales and marketing activities for subscriber acquisitions  additional content and programming development  non operating and capital expenditures  corporate expense which includes debt restructuring cost of million  interest costs of million and cash repayment of million as per terms of convertible note restructuring referred above 
in addition  if we are unable to negotiate a further payment plan with internal revenue service  the company may be required to retire its outstanding tax liability of million 
our business plan includes spends in india mainly for a moderate level of build out of terrestrial repeater network  service launch in key cities and continued marketing spend towards subscriber acquisitions  for italy  contemplates service launch and technology related expenses  for middle east  involves minimal terrestrial repeater capital expenditures for a network in bahrain  and for china  other western europe markets and other selected markets within our coverage areas  includes limited business development expenses 
we are currently reviewing our business plan for potential modifications that could result in the reduction of cash expenditures over the next months 

table of contents our business is in its early stages  and we regularly evaluate our plans and strategy 
these evaluations may result in changes to our plans and strategy  some of which may be material and significantly change our cash requirement 
our business plan is based on estimates regarding expected future costs and expected revenue 
our costs may exceed or our revenues may fall short of our estimates  our estimates may change  and future developments may affect our estimates 
furthermore  we will require additional cash to fully launch our business in china and western europe and fund the cost to modify and launch our spare satellite 
a principal amount of million of the senior secured notes we will issue as part of the convertible note restructuring will be repayable on the first anniversary of the closing date of the transaction 
any of these factors may increase our need for funds  which would require us to seek additional financing to continue implementing our current business plan 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing financing or that it will be available to us at attractive terms 
our ability to obtain the financing in the future will depend on several factors  including future market conditions  our success in developing  implementing and marketing our satellite radio service  our future creditworthiness and restrictions contained in agreements with our investors or lenders 
if we fail to obtain any necessary financing on a timely basis or on attractive terms  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
additional financings could also increase our level of indebtedness or result in further dilution to existing shareholders 
under the terms of the senior secured notes and amended and restated convertible notes we will issue as part of the convertible note restructuring  we may incur secured indebtedness of up to million less any amounts outstanding under the senior secured notes of senior secured first priority indebtedness 
we may borrow up to million less any amounts outstanding under the amended and restated convertible notes of senior secured second priority indebtedness which is pari passu with the amended and restated convertible notes and unlimited unsecured debt  as long as such debt has a maturity date that is at least days after the maturity date of the amended and restated convertible notes 
we will be required to repay any outstanding principal of the senior secured notes from new equity or debt financing  certain excess cash flow or the cash proceeds of asset sales and casualty events  subject to customary exceptions 
we are not permitted to make any mandatory or optional prepayment on debt other than permitted first priority secured debt while the amended and restated convertible notes are outstanding 
capital expenditures we have spent approximately million on capital expenditures related to the development and launch of our satellites  for our ground systems and for property and equipment 
we may spend additional amounts to enhance our infrastructure with terrestrial repeaters depending on licenses and business requirement  if supported by an appropriate business model and funding of such projects 
we expect to start our terrestrial repeater network build out in key metropolitan areas in india during  assuming we obtain the necessary regulatory approvals  we currently estimate to be approximately million over the next few years 
this amount will need to be reviewed as we conduct actual testing  including further topographical analysis 
we also expect to start our terrestrial repeater build out in bahrain  however we do not expect this cost to be significant 
over the next months we also anticipate technology and terrestrial repeater development expenses associated with rolling out our services in italy 
we estimate those expenses to be approximately million beginning in this amount will need to be reviewed as we conduct actual testing as in india 
until we receive the final approvals from china s regulatory agencies  we will not start the build out of a terrestrial repeater network in china 
we expect the total network in china to cost a similar amount as india in its initial stages 
our future capital expenditures will depend on our business strategy and our response to business opportunities and trends in our industry and our markets 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency as a global company  we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations 
these risks include the translation of local currency balances of our foreign subsidiaries  intercompany balances between subsidiaries that operate in different functional currencies and transactions with customers  suppliers and employees that are denominated in foreign currencies 
our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through our normal operating activities and  where appropriate  to have these transactions denominated in united states dollars 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total revenues and of total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total revenues and of total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies 
the following table shows approximately the split of these foreign currency exposures by principal currency foreign currency exposure at december  euro indian rupee kenyan shilling south african rand other total exposure total revenues total cost of revenues and operating expenses foreign currency exposure at december  euro indian rupee kenyan shilling south african rand other total exposure total revenues total cost of revenues and operating expenses interest rates our market risk from changes in interest rates is not material because our long term debt only includes million of the senior secured notes and the amended and restated convertible notes which have a fixed interest rate 
we classify our investments in money market funds as cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of investment grade securities with high credit ratings of relatively short duration that trade in highly liquid markets 
accordingly  we have no quantitative information concerning the market risks and believe that the risk is minimal 
we currently do not hedge either foreign exchange or interest rate exposures  but do not believe that an increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the value of our cash equivalents  marketable securities or the convertible notes 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities
