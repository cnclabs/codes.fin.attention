item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
see risk factors under item a above regarding certain factors known to us that could cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future results 
also note that because our acquisition of portauthority technologies  inc was completed in january  there was no financial impact on our financial condition and results of operation for our year ended december  overview our products help organizations manage their networks and computing resources to provide a secure and productive computing environment 
we provide web filtering and web security software products that enable organizations to protect employees and confidential information from external web based attacks such as spyware  and phishing  as well as analyze  report and manage how employees use computing resources and the internet 
in january  we acquired our technology development partner for information leak prevention solutions  portauthority technologies  inc portauthority 
as a result  in addition to our web filtering and web security software products  we offer software that helps prevent the loss of confidential information from internal threats  such as ineffective business process controls  employee error and malfeasance 
we focus our business on developing and selling web filtering and web security products that automate organizations internet and application use policies as well as information leak protection solutions 
websense enterprise is our core web filtering solution  providing fully featured web filtering and serving as management platforms for related websense add on modules  such as our security filtering  remote filtering and client policy manager 
we have also created the websense web security suite to address specific customer needs 
we currently derive all of our revenue from subscriptions to the websense enterprise based solutions and expect this to continue in the future as more offerings are added to the websense enterprise platforms 
since we released our first software product in  our products have evolved from preventing the download of unacceptable content to products that proactively manage employee computing resources and the internet to maximize productivity and prevent access to the most undesirable and dangerous elements on the web  such as web sites that contain or will download viruses  spyware  keyloggers  phishing exploits and an ever increasing variety of malicious code 
at the foundation of our web filtering and web security product offering is the websense enterprise software application  which serves as a central policy engine and management and reporting platform for our web filtering and related add on web security products 
websense enterprise gives organizations the ability to enhance network security  improve employee productivity  mitigate potential legal liability and conserve network bandwidth by allowing organizations to identify potential risk areas and implement and automate web access and application usage policies that reduce these risks 
when combined with our web security products that utilize our threatseeker technology including security filtering  remote filtering and client policy manager  websense enterprise allows organizations to enhance network and content security by blocking access to malicious web sites and preventing the transmission of data to known spyware destination sites 
to simplify the purchase process for our value added resellers and customers  we have created a suite of websense enterprise and our most popular add on security products and services  known as the websense web security suite 
we have been developing web content filtering and security solutions to protect internet users from receiving and accessing unwanted or illegal content on their mobile phones and personal digital assistants pdas 
we have engaged in discussions regarding mobile filtering solutions with several third parties  and we expect to close our first transaction for the mobile filtering and security products in during  we derived of revenue from international sales  compared with for  with the united kingdom comprising approximately of our total revenue in both years 
we believe international markets continue to represent a significant growth opportunity and we are continuing to expand our international operations  particularly in selected countries in the european  asia pacific and latin american markets 
we sell websense enterprise through both indirect channels and directly  and are transitioning to a two tier distribution strategy in north america 
sales through indirect channels currently account for more than of our revenue  and we plan to increase the percentage of our revenue obtained through indirect channels 
our strategy is to increase new and renewal customer sales through independent software distributors and resellers and increase the focus of our internal sales and marketing force on supporting our channel strategy 
as a result  we expect to increase the proportion of our sales made through indirect channels 
in august  we announced a new two tier distribution strategy in north america and entered into a relationship with ingram micro to distribute  market and support our web security and web filtering software in north america 
through joint marketing programs with websense  ingram micro will focus its efforts on recruiting new resellers  especially resellers focused on selling to small and medium sized businesses smb  and on building awareness and demand within our existing north america channel partner base 
as described elsewhere in this report  we recognize revenue from subscriptions to our products  including add on modules  on a daily straight line basis commencing on the day the term of the subscription begins  over the term of the subscription agreement 
we recognize the operating expenses related to these sales as they are incurred 
these operating expenses include sales commissions  which are based on the total amount of the subscription contract and are fully expensed in the period the product is delivered 
operating expenses have continued to increase as compared with prior periods due to expanded selling and marketing efforts  continued product research and development and investments in administrative infrastructure to support subscription sales that we will recognize as revenue in subsequent periods 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
when a purchase decision is made for our products  customers enter into a subscription agreement  which is generally  or months in duration and for a fixed number of users 
other services such as upgrades enhancements and standard post contract technical support services are sold together with our product subscription and provided throughout the subscription term 
prior to january   we recognized revenue on a monthly straight line basis  commencing with the month the subscription began 
effective as of january   we recognize revenue on a daily straight line basis commencing on the date the term of the subscription begins  and continuing over the term of the subscription agreement  provided collectability is reasonably assured 
during  we re evaluated our revenue recognition policy in accordance with the provisions of sop and determined that our prior practice resulted in a material cummulative difference in our deferred revenue 
upon entering into a subscription arrangement for a fixed or determinable fee  we electronically deliver access codes to users and then promptly invoice customers for the full amount of their subscriptions 
payment is due for the full term of the subscription  generally within to days of the invoice 
we record amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
in connection with the change in revenue recognition policy  we adopted staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  and applied the special cumulative effect transition provision to our financial statements 
the cumulative net result is an increase in deferred revenue and a reduction in retained earnings  before tax impact  as of january  by million 
for  the impact of daily revenue recognition on subscriptions was to reduce revenue recognized by million  reduce net income by million  and increase deferred revenue by an additional million to a total increase of million when compared to what these amounts would have been under the monthly revenue recognition policy 
we record distributor marketing payments and channel rebates as an offset to revenue 
we recognize distributor marketing payments as an offset to revenue as the marketing service is provided 
we recognize channel rebates as an offset to revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the subscription agreement 
accounting for share based compensation 
through december   we accounted for share based employee compensation plans under the measurement and recognition provisions of accounting principles board apb no 
apb no 
 and related interpretations  as permitted by financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

accordingly  we recorded no share based employee compensation expense for options granted under our amended and restated stock incentive plan plan or predecessor plans or options granted as non plan inducement options during the twelve months ended december  as all other options granted had exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant 
we also recorded no compensation expense in connection with the employee stock purchase plan as the purchase price of the stock was not less than of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period 
in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 
 we disclosed net income or loss and net income or loss per share as if the fair value based method was applied in measuring compensation expense for share based incentive programs 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expense that we recognized beginning on that date includes a compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and b compensation expense for all share based payments granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
results for prior periods will not be restated 
the results for the twelve months ended december  include share based compensation expense of million excluding tax effects 
compensation expense related to share based awards is generally amortized over the vesting period in the related expense categories of the consolidated statement of income 
at december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans excluding tax effects 
that total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for estimated forfeitures as well as for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average period of approximately three years 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model and the assumptions described below 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on the history of grants and exercises in our option database 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on both the historical volatility as well as the implied volatility of publicly traded options on our common stock  consistent with sfas no 
r and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 

we base the risk free interest rate that is used in the black scholes option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on us treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
we amortize the fair value ratably over the vesting period of the awards  which is typically four years 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
for purposes of calculating pro forma information under sfas no 
for periods prior to january   we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future or select a different option valuation model altogether  which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share in the future 
we determine the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model that is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  in management s opinion  the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with sfas no 
r and sab no 
using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
deferred tax assets 
as required by sfas no 
 we recognize tax assets on the balance sheet if it is more likely than not that they will be realized on future tax returns 
at december   we had deferred tax assets of million 
we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
factors considered by us included our earnings history  projected earnings based on current operations  and projected future taxable income 
however  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged against income in the period such determination was made 
income tax provision and tax contingency reserve 
significant judgment is required in determining our consolidated income tax provision and evaluating our us and foreign tax positions 
it is our policy to maintain tax contingency reserves for tax audit issues that are probable to occur and can reasonably be estimated 
we review the reserves as circumstances warrant and adjust the reserves as events occur that affect our potential liability for additional taxes  such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations  conclusion of tax audits  additional exposure based on current calculations  identification of new issues or rendering of court decisions affecting a particular tax issue 
tax reserve contingencies and changes to the reserves are evaluated and recorded in our tax provision in the period in which the above noted events occur 
in addition  we settled our uk income tax audit resulting in the reversal of previously recorded tax contingency reserves 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to pay their invoices 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
results of operations the following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of total revenues for each of the periods shown

we expect our revenue to increase over revenue levels  as a result of our deferred revenue under existing subscriptions  our renewal business  and expected worldwide growth  partially offset by increased distributor marketing payments and channel payments 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists of the costs of content review  technical support and infrastructure costs associated with maintaining our databases 
cost of revenue increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to the costs associated with share based compensation expense relating to our adoption of sfas no 
r on january   as well as additional personnel in our technical support and database groups and allocated costs 
we allocate the total costs for human resources  employee benefits  payroll taxes  information technology  facilities  fixed asset depreciation and legal costs to each of our functional areas based on salaries and headcount data 
we expect cost of revenue to increase in the future to support the growth and maintenance of our databases as well as the technical support needs of our customers

selling and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in selling and marketing expenses of million was primarily due to share based compensation expenses relating to our adoption of sfas no 
r on january   as well as additional expenses associated with our new channel strategy  increased personnel costs and related travel  and allocated costs 
we expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future as more personnel are added to support our expanding selling and marketing efforts worldwide  including for our new information leak prevention products  and as increased sales result in higher overall sales commission expenses 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software developers and allocated costs 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase of million in research and development expenses was primarily due to share based compensation expense relating to our adoption of sfas no 
r on january   as well as increased personnel needed to support our expanding list of technology partners  the enhancements of websense enterprise and additional products  and allocated costs 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods due to our acquisition of portauthority and its engineering team  and as more personnel are added to support our continued enhancements of our products  our recently acquired information leak prevention products from portauthority  as well as the development of new products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related expenses for our executive  finance  and administrative personnel  third party professional service fees and allocated costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of share based compensation expense relating to our adoption of sfas no 
r on january   as well as additional personnel needed to support our growing operations  and allocated costs 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods reflecting growth in operations  increasing expenses associated with being a public company and expansion of our international operations 
other income  net net other income increased to million in from million in the increase was due primarily to higher interest rates realized on our increased balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during compared with the majority of our investments of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are tax exempt 
we expect that the majority of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will continue to be held in tax exempt investments during the foreseeable future 
our acquisition of portauthority for approximately million  on january   will reduce our balance of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities from which we generate interest income 
provision for income taxes in  united states and foreign income tax expense was million as compared to million for the annual effective income tax rate for was compared to for the increase in the tax rate is primarily related to an increase in the provision for state income taxes and the impact of sfas r on stock compensation that does not result in a tax deduction 
the increase in tax rate is partially offset by an increase in tax exempt income 
our effective tax rate may change in future periods due to the composition of taxable income between domestic and international operations  the magnitude of our tax exempt income  and any future changes or interpretations in tax rules and legislation  or corresponding accounting rules 
we are presently analyzing the impact of our acquisition of portauthority on our effective tax rate 
years ended december  and revenue revenue increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily a result of the addition of new  renewed and upgraded subscriptions from our customers that resulted in a million increase in the number of seats under subscription from december  to december  approximately of subscription revenue recognized in and was derived from renewal business

general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of additional personnel needed to support our growing operations  increased allocated costs and an increase in professional accounting fees driven by compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of other income  net net other income increased to million in from million in the increase was due primarily to higher interest rates realized on our increased balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during compared with provision for income taxes in  united states and foreign income tax expense was million as compared to million for the annual effective income tax rate for was compared to for the annual effective tax rate for was lower than the effective tax rate primarily due to an increase in foreign earnings taxed at less than the united states federal income tax rate  an increase in tax exempt interest income and an increase in federal and state research and development tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  investments in marketable securities of million  and retained earnings of million 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  investments in marketable securities of million and retained earnings of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared with net cash provided by operating activities of million in the million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to decreased tax benefits from fewer exercises of stock options and decreased growth in deferred revenue subscription amounts in excess of recognizable revenue are recorded as deferred revenue compared to our operating cash flow is significantly influenced by subscription renewals and accounts receivable collections  and deferred revenue 
a decrease in subscription renewals or accounts receivable collections  or a lower deferred revenue balance  will negatively impact our operating cash flow 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in compared with net cash used in investing activities of million in the million increase of net cash provided by investing activities for was primarily due to fewer purchases to offset the maturities and sales of marketable securities 
net cash used by financing activities was million in compared with net cash used by financing activities of million in the million increase in net cash used by financing activities in was primarily due to share repurchases of  shares of our common stock for million  compared with share repurchases of  shares for million in  and the reduction of proceeds from exercises of employee stock options in a majority of our operating lease commitments are related to our worldwide office space leases  which expire at various dates through december the rent expense related to our worldwide office space leases are recorded monthly on a straight line basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
future minimum annual payments under non cancelable operating leases at february  are as follows in thousands years ending december operating leases total as of december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
on april   we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million shares of our common stock 
on august   we announced that our board of directors increased the size of the stock repurchase program by an additional million shares  for a total program size of up to million shares 
on july   we announced that our board of directors increased the size of the stock repurchase program by an additional million shares  for a total program size of up to million shares 
repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions 
depending on market conditions and other factors  purchases under this program may be commenced or suspended at any time  or from time to time  without prior notice 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock under this program  for an aggregate of million at an average price of per share 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents balances  investments in marketable securities and our ongoing cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements  including our capital expenditures and stock repurchases  if any  for at least the next months 
in january  we used approximately million of our cash to acquire of portauthority technologies  inc as well as to repay the indebtedness of portauthority 
our cash requirements may increase for reasons we do not currently foresee or we may make acquisitions as part of our growth strategy that increase our cash requirements 
we may elect to raise funds for these purposes through capital markets transactions or debt or private equity transactions as appropriate 
we intend to continue to invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in interest bearing  investment grade securities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures are related to our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments  municipal bonds  government agency obligations  and corporate bonds 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our short term available for sale investments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december  changes in interest rates over time will  however  affect our interest income 
we utilize foreign currency forward contracts and zero cost collar contracts to hedge foreign currency market exposures of underlying assets and liabilities 
we bill customers in euro denominated countries in the euro 
we also keep working funds necessary to facilitate the short term operations of our subsidiaries in the local currencies in which they do business 
our objective is to reduce the risk to earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
notional and fair values of our hedging positions at december  and are presented in the table below in thousands december  december  notional value local currency notional value usd fair value usd notional value local currency notional value usd fair value usd euro british pound total the million notional decrease in our euro hedged position is primarily due to our increased working capital requirements payable in euros  which creates a natural hedge against the euro based billings 
all of the euro hedging contracts will be settled before february  for and  less than of our total billings were denominated in the euro 
we do not expect foreign currency billings to represent more than of our total billings during the million notional decrease in our british pound hedged position is primarily due to a shortening of the period hedged as well as a decrease in the percentage of working funds hedged 
all of the british pound hedging contracts will be settled before march  in  we expect an increase in british pound expenditures and our corresponding hedged commitments to be consistent with our increase in overall operating expenditures 
given our foreign exchange position  a change in foreign exchange rates upon which these foreign exchange contracts are based would result in exchange gains and losses 
in all material aspects  these exchange gains and losses would be fully offset by exchange gains and losses on the underlying net monetary exposures for which the contracts are designated as hedges 
we do not expect material exchange rate gains and losses from unhedged foreign currency exposures
