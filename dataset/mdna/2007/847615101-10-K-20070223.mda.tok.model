sales of our signal and power integrity components were up million in fiscal  reflecting improved overall market conditions and greater availability of required ceramic components 
shipments of our power management systems declined slightly  as certain telecom equipment customers worked through temporary excess inventories 
in late august of  hurricane katrina virtually destroyed our ceramic manufacturing plant in new orleans  louisiana 
our new orleans operations designed and manufactured custom ceramic components  which are an essential element of our signal integrity products 
with this disruption to our internal ceramic manufacturing capabilities  we have had to purchase these specialty ceramic components from third party suppliers  at prices significantly greater than our previous manufactured costs 
as a result of these higher costs for ceramic components  our gross margin has declined as a percentage of sales 
in fiscal  our gross margin was million or of sales  compared to million or of sales in fiscal to address our ongoing ceramic component needs and re establish our own ceramic manufacturing capabilities  we acquired in december a ceramic manufacturing facility in state college  pennsylvania 
the acquired facility is becoming the design and manufacturing center for our ceramic products  replacing the operations previously conducted in new orleans 
in june  limited production commenced at our new state college operations 
presently  we expect full production to be achieved for all of our ceramic product lines by the end of may when full production levels are achieved  and all purchasing and consumption of third party ceramics are eliminated  we expect our material costs to decrease and our gross margin to return to a more historical level of approximately 
driven by our higher sales volume  our overall profitability improved 
net income was million or cents per share diluted in  compared to million or cents per share in net cash generated by operating activities was  in  down million from the preceding year

sales of microwave components and systems grew by million in the current year  primarily arising from increased shipments for products used in numerous military applications including counter electronic devices  military aircraft and vehicles  and secure communications 
sales of our signal and power integrity components were million in fiscal year  up million from a year ago  reflecting improved overall market conditions throughout the passive electronic components industry 
in addition  as a result of hurricane katrina and its related disruption of our internally manufactured ceramic components  approximately million of signal product shipments were delayed as of the end of fiscal sales of our power management systems declined by  in the current year  as certain of our telecom equipment customers worked through temporary excess inventories 
we continue to be optimistic about the long term growth potential of these advanced systems  which are used in various infrastructure equipment including optical networks  data centers  wireless base stations  as well as various military applications 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued total customer orders received in fiscal amounted to million  an increase of million or from the preceding year 
at november   our sales order backlog was million  up million or from the end of fiscal overall  average selling prices remained relatively stable in for all of our major product lines

in fiscal  our gross margin was million or of sales  compared to million of of sales in fiscal total material costs amounted to million or of sales in the current year  compared to million or of sales last year 
to address our ongoing ceramic component needs and to re establish our own ceramic manufacturing capabilities  we acquired in december a ceramic manufacturing facility in state college  pennsylvania 
the acquired facility is becoming the design and manufacturing center for our ceramic products  replacing the operations previously conducted in new orleans 
in june  limited production commenced at our new state college operations 
presently  we expect full production to be achieved for all of our ceramic product lines by the end of may when full production levels are achieved  and all purchasing and consumption of third party ceramics are eliminated  we expect our material costs to decrease and our gross margin to return to a more historical level of approximately 
as a percentage of sales  labor and manufacturing overhead declined slightly in the current year 
aggregate labor and manufacturing overhead expenses were of sales in  versus of sales in  principally reflecting economies of scale achieved with higher sales volumes 
at november   we had a total workforce of  employees  up from the end of fiscal year we expect to continuously review our organization and cost structure to enhance operating efficiencies  while maintaining flexibility for future capacity expansion 
selling  general and administrative expense selling expense amounted to million or of sales in fiscal  compared to million or of sales in fiscal the decrease in selling expense primarily arises from reductions in advertising and other discretionary expenditures 
as a percentage of sales  the decline in selling expense principally reflects the impact of leveraging certain fixed selling expenses over higher sales volume 
general and administrative expense was million in  versus million in this increase of million includes pre production start up costs of  associated with our newly acquired state college facility   of equity based compensation expense from our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  and asset impairment losses of  associated with our former new orleans ceramic facility  in excess of losses recorded in fiscal year the balance of the increase in general and administrative expense reflects various expenditures related to our greater business activity 
interest expense interest expense was  in fiscal  up  from fiscal this increase primarily reflects our short term borrowings 
during the year ended november   weighted average borrowings under our domestic line of credit amounted to million with an average interest rate of and maximum month end borrowings of million 
these borrowings substantially financed our acquisition of atp  as well as certain working capital requirements 
throughout  no borrowings were outstanding under our domestic line of credit arrangement 
other income and expense we hold numerous united states and foreign patents relating to polymer multilayer pml technology 
we realized license fee income of  in and  in upon the granting of pml technology licenses 
although these licenses  as well as other pml licenses that we have previously granted  require certain royalties to be paid to us upon the sale of products utilizing pml technology  it is not known what future commercial value  if any  these patents and related licenses may have 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries transact business with certain customers and vendors in currencies other than their local currency 
as a result  we recognize gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
foreign currency transaction net gains of  in and net losses of  in were recognized and included in nonoperating income and expense 
we realized interest income of  in and  in from temporary cash investments 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was in and in  compared to an applicable federal and state statutory income tax rate of approximately 
differences between the effective tax rate and statutory tax rate primarily arise from state tax provisions  foreign income tax rates  and the us domestic manufacturers deduction 
at november   we had recorded certain deferred tax assets  including aggregate state net operating loss carryforwards of  expiring at varying amounts through in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon our level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income  we believe it is more likely than not that the benefits of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  no deferred tax asset valuation allowance was recorded at november  compared to net sales our net sales increased by million or from this increase primarily reflects additional shipment volume for our microwave components and systems 
sales for this business segment were million in  up million from a year ago 
of this million increase  million reflects amplifonix product sales and another million was generated by our operations in palm bay  florida  which we acquired in october as part of our acquisition of cbu 
although our microwave components and systems are used in numerous industries and applications  sales in the military aerospace sector were particularly strong in sales of our power management systems grew by million in fiscal since our introduction of these advanced products a few year ago  we have gained customer recognition and market share in various telecom equipment and military applications 
shipments of our signal and power integrity components were down million in  principally reflecting poor market conditions throughout the passive electronic components industry 
these market conditions began to demonstrate improvement in the fourth quarter of fiscal additionally  because of the impact of hurricane katrina  million of signal product shipments were delayed at the end of fiscal total customer orders received in fiscal amounted to million  up million or from at november   our sales order backlog was million  compared to million at november  overall  average selling prices remained relatively stable in throughout all of our product lines 
gross margin gross margin in fiscal was million or of sales  compared to million or of sales in fiscal as a percentage of sales  material and labor costs declined in fiscal with aggregate material and labor costs amounting to of sales in and of sales in this decrease primarily reflects reduced material costs from numerous cost reduction programs  including the expanded worldwide sourcing of our material and component requirements 
total manufacturing overhead costs were million or of sales in  versus million or of sales in the increase in manufacturing costs was principally driven by the following factors  all of relatively equal significance ongoing integration and consolidation costs associated with our acquisitions of amplifonix and cbu  poor absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead resulting from the decline in revenue of our signal and power integrity components business  and additional manufacturing overhead required to support the current and expected future growth of our microwave components and systems business 
at november   we had a total workforce of  employees  compared to  employees at november  
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal  selling expense amounted to million or of sales  compared to million or of sales in fiscal the decrease in selling expense  as a percentage of sales  principally reflects the impact of higher sales volume and certain fixed selling expenses 
general and administrative expense was million in  versus million in the increase in general and administrative expense includes  of net asset impairment losses and expenses related to hurricane katrina   of computer software licensing fees for additional employees and system users  and  of added amortization expense primarily from acquisition related intangible assets 
the balance of the increase in general and administrative expense reflects additional expenditures for legal and professional services associated with our future compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  and other operating expenses related to our increased business levels 
other income and expense interest expense remained relatively constant at  in fiscal and  in fiscal reductions in bank indebtedness in were substantially offset by higher average interest rates 
in  other income and expense consists of interest income from short term investments of  pml license fee income of  and net losses on foreign currency transactions of  in  other income and expense reflects  of interest income   of pml license fee income  and  of net losses on foreign currency transactions 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was in and in  compared to an applicable federal and state statutory income tax rate of approximately 
differences between the effective tax rate and statutory tax rate primarily arise from state tax provisions and foreign income tax rates 
at november   we had recorded certain deferred tax assets  including aggregate state net operating loss carryforwards of  expiring at varying amounts through based upon our level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income  we believe it is more likely than not that the benefits of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  no deferred tax asset valuation allowance was recorded at november  risk factors that may affect future results in fiscal year  approximately of our sales were to customers in the telecommunications industry 
our three largest telecom customers  original equipment manufacturers of telecommunications equipment  represented of our total consolidated net sales in several years ago  the telecommunications equipment industry experienced a severe slowdown 
recently  market conditions in the industry have demonstrated improvement  but overall market trends and forecasts remain unpredictable 
if the current market conditions deteriorate  it will have a material negative impact on our future operating performance 
military aircraft and naval vessels generally contain extensive communication equipment  electronic countermeasure equipment for defense against enemy weapons  smart weapons and munitions  and radar systems 
we provide low pass filters  multisection assemblies  and various microwave components and integrated assemblies to major equipment manufacturers for installation into these systems 
we also provide various emi filtered arrays and filtered connectors to aerospace manufacturers for use in commercial applications such as point to point telemetry and avionic upgrades 
in fiscal  military aerospace sales were approximately of our consolidated sales 
demand for military aerospace products may be impacted by numerous economic  technological and political factors 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that sales to such customers will not decrease in the future 
raw materials used in the manufacture of certain ceramic capacitors include silver  palladium  and platinum 
precious metals are available from many sources  however  their prices may be subject to significant fluctuations and such fluctuations may have a material and adverse affect on our operating results 
in addition  our results of operations may be negatively affected in the future by a variety of other factors including time delays and cost overages in ramping up ceramic capacitor manufacturing at our new state college facilities  cost increases and delivery delays for ceramic capacitors purchased from third party suppliers  competitive pricing pressures  new technologies which decrease the demand for our products  new product offerings by our competitors  product cost changes  changes in the overall economic climate  cancellation of existing customer order backlog  unanticipated impairment of assets  difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and product lines  and changes in product mix 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity  capital resources and financial condition we maintain a domestic line of credit with our principal lending institution  pnc bank  na of erie  pennsylvania the bank  in the aggregate amount of million  with an additional million expansion feature 
borrowings under the line of credit are secured by substantially all of our tangible and intangible personal property  and bear interest at rates below the prevailing prime rate 
at november   million was outstanding under this line of credit arrangement 
the line of credit agreement contains certain covenants  the most restrictive of which require us to maintain designated minimum levels of net worth and profitability  and impose certain restrictions on us regarding additional indebtedness 
at november   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
the current line of credit agreement expires in december our ability to borrow in the future under this credit facility is dependent on our ongoing compliance with the restrictive covenants 
whether we continue to comply with these covenants is largely dependent on our ability to attain certain levels of operating performance and profitability in the future  for which there can be no assurance 
our wholly owned german subsidiary maintains an unsecured euro line of credit with a german financial institution aggregating approximately million euro million 
at november   no borrowings were outstanding under this line of credit 
future borrowings  if any  will bear interest at rates below the prevailing prime rate and will be payable upon demand 
at november   we had net working capital of million  compared to million at november  and million at november  at november   current assets were times current liabilities  compared to at the end of fiscal and at the end of fiscal in  the reduction in our working capital and current ratio principally reflects million of net cash purchase price for our acquisition of atp  which was substantially funded through borrowings under our domestic line of credit 
our net working capital and current ratio also decreased in because of the cash requirements associated with the acquisition of land  building and equipment in connection with our new ceramic manufacturing facility in state college  pennsylvania 
in and  the reductions in our working capital and current ratio primarily reflect the impact of acquiring businesses and their related long lived assets by utilizing some of our cash reserves 
excluding the assets acquired from atp  our capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment amounted to million in of these capital expenditures  million relates to our new state college operations with the remaining capital expenditures principally supporting manufacturing capacity expansion in our microwave business 
insurance proceeds of million were received in associated with the fixed assets destroyed or damaged by hurricane katrina  with another million of insurance proceeds expected to be received in fiscal at november   we had not entered into any material commitments for additional capital expenditures 
aggregate capital expenditures were million in fiscal and million in fiscal capital expenditures in were primarily for building improvements and production equipment for our china manufacturing operations  as well as expanding capacity and improving efficiencies in our microwave components and systems business 
in  our capital expenditures principally related to routine replacement of fixed assets  and initial tooling for our china production requirements 
in july  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of atp 
the net cash purchase price for atp was million  which was substantially funded by borrowings under our domestic line of credit 
we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of jdk in october in february  we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of amplifonix 
the total net cash purchase price for these acquired businesses was million  which was entirely funded through available cash reserves 
in october  we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of cbu 
we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of sei in february the total net cash purchase price for these acquired businesses was million  which was entirely funded through available cash reserves 
we have adopted a stock repurchase program 
under this program  we may repurchase up to million of the company s outstanding common stock 
acquired shares are to be purchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at prevailing market prices 
funding for these repurchases is expected to come from available cash reserves and borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility 
the amount and timing of the shares repurchased are based on our ongoing assessment of the company s capital structure  liquidity  and the market price of the company s common stock 
the repurchased shares are held as treasury stock 
no shares were repurchased in fiscal  or since the inception of the stock repurchase program   shares have been repurchased at a total cost of million 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued research and development expenditures  which encompass the personnel and related expenses devoted to developing new products and processes  amounted to million in  million in  and million in we expect to continue our investment in research and development in  as we continuously enhance existing product lines  design new signal and power integrity components  further develop our microwave products and power management systems  and increase our participation in emerging markets such as automotive 
income taxes paid during the fiscal years ended november   and amounted to million  million  and million  respectively 
as a result of certain deferred tax assets  we expect cash outlays for income taxes to be less than income tax expense for fiscal as of november   our obligations and firm commitments are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt operating leases current financial resources  including working capital and existing lines of credit  and anticipated funds from operations are expected to be sufficient to meet operating cash requirements throughout fiscal year  including scheduled long term debt repayment  lease commitments  planned capital expenditures  research and development expenses  and possible stock repurchases 
there can be no assurance  however  that unplanned capital replacement or other future events will not require us to seek additional debt or equity financing and  if so required  that it will be available on terms acceptable to us 
net cash generated by operating activities was  in  down million from the preceding year 
with sales volume and production requirements significantly growing  accounts receivable and inventories increased in by million and million  respectively 
operating cash flow in also reflects the payment of a ten year insurance premium in the amount of million 
the related insurance policy provides environmental clean up cost cap coverage and pollution legal liability coverage for our recently acquired state college facility 
net cash generated by operating activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal accounts receivable turnover rates improved in  primarily reflecting the successful integration of collection efforts for our acquired businesses 
despite increased sales volume and production requirements  aggregate inventories decreased by  in fiscal year  excluding the impact of our acquired businesses 
this inventory reduction was achieved through numerous inventory control procedures  including material substitutions and reduced manufacturing cycle times 
at november   goodwill represented of our total assets and of our stockholders equity 
in addition to a total of million of goodwill recognized in connection with our recent acquisitions of atp  jdk  amplifonix  cbu and sei  another million of goodwill was realized in earlier acquisitions 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we have performed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill and determined that no impairment loss need be recognized in the years ended november   and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency certain of our european sales and related selling expenses are denominated in euros  british pounds sterling  and other local currencies 
in addition  certain of our operating expenses are denominated in mexican pesos and chinese yuan 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect our operating results and cash flows 
to manage our exposure to the euro and british pound sterling  we occasionally enter into forward currency exchange contracts 
at november   we did not have any forward currency exchange contracts outstanding 
for each of the three years ended november   currency exchange rate gains and losses were not material 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued interest rate exposure we have market risk exposure relating to possible fluctuations in interest rates 
from time to time  we utilize interest rate swap agreements to minimize the risks and costs associated with variable rate debt 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest rate swap agreements are entered into with major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
at november   no interest rate swap agreements were outstanding 
environmental matters on december   we acquired certain land and ceramic manufacturing facilities in state college  pennsylvania 
the property  which was acquired from murata electronics north america murata  consists of approximately acres of land and  square feet of manufacturing facilities 
the acquired facilities have become the design and manufacturing center for our ceramic operations  replacing the ceramic operations previously conducted in new orleans  louisiana 
the purchase price for the acquired property consisted of a  plus b closing costs of  including realtor commissions  transfer taxes  and legal fees  plus c the assumption of  and indemnification of murata against  all environmental liabilities related to the property 
the acquired property has known environmental conditions that require remediation  and certain hazardous materials previously used on the property have migrated into neighboring third party areas 
these environmental issues arose from the use of chlorinated organic solvents including tetrachloroethylene pce and trichloroethylene tce 
as a condition to the purchase  we entered into an agreement with the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep pursuant to which a we agreed to remediate all known environmental conditions relating to the property to a specified industrial standard  with our costs for remediating such conditions being capped at million  b padep released murata from further claims by pennsylvania under specified state laws for the known environmental conditions  and c we purchased an insurance policy providing clean up cost cap coverage for known and unknown pollutants with a combined coverage limit of approximately million  and pollution legal liability coverage for possible third party claims with an aggregate coverage limit of million 
the total premium cost for the insurance policy  which has a ten year term and an aggregate deductible of  was million 
the cost of the insurance is being charged to general and administrative expense on a pro rata basis over the ten year policy term  which approximates the period of remediation of the environmental liability 
based upon estimates prepared by our environmental consultants  we recorded a liability of million to cover probable future environmental expenditures related to the remediation  the cost of which is expected to be entirely covered by the insurance policy 
as of november   remediation expenditures of  have been incurred and charged against the environmental liability  with all such expenditures being reimbursed by the insurance carrier 
the remaining aggregate undiscounted expenditures of million  which are anticipated to be incurred over the next nine years  principally consist of a continued operation and monitoring of the existing on site groundwater extraction  treatment  and recharge system  b implementation of a chemical oxidation system  subject to the results of a laboratory treatability study  c completion of soil investigations to determine the extent of potential soil contamination  d excavation and off site disposal of soil containing contaminates above acceptable standards  and e implementation of soil vapor extraction systems in certain areas 
depending upon the results of future environmental testing and remediation actions  it is possible that the ultimate costs incurred could exceed the current aggregate estimate of million 
we expect such increase  if any  to be entirely covered by the insurance policy 
insurance recoveries for actual environmental remediation costs incurred are recorded when it is probable that such insurance reimbursement will be received and the related amounts are determinable 
such insurance recoveries are credited to our general and administrative expense 
based on the current remediation plan developed by our environmental consultants   of the total remediation costs is expected to be incurred during the next twelve months 
we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the united states and other countries 
us federal environmental legislation having particular impact on us includes the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean air act  the clean water act  and the safe drinking water act 
we also are subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters 
the united states environmental protection agency epa  osha  and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an impact on our operations 
in addition to these federal agencies  various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes 
many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations  some of which are similar to federal requirements 
state and federal authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of these laws and regulations 
as part of our continuing environmental program  we have been able to comply with such proceedings and orders without any materially adverse effect on our business 
we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings involving environmental matters 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued impact of inflation in recent years  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
however  we continuously monitor operating price increases  particularly in connection with the supply of precious metals used in our manufacturing of certain ceramic capacitors 
to the extent permitted by competition  we pass increased costs on to our customers by increasing sales price over time 
sales price increases  however  were not significant in any of the years presented herein 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb  chapter sfas no 

sfas no 
clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage by requiring that these items be recognized as current period charges 
the statement also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  our adoption of sfas no 
in the fiscal year ended november   did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company s fiscal year 
we are currently reviewing the provisions of fin  but we do not expect it will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
 defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
prior to this statement  there were different definitions of fair value and limited guidance for applying those definitions in gaap 
sfas no 
applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some entities  the application of sfas no 
will change current practice 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years the company s fiscal year 
we are currently reviewing the provisions of sfas no 
 but we do not expect it will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we believe our most critical accounting policies relate to the valuation and carrying amounts of accounts receivable  inventories  long lived assets  and deferred tax assets 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors including an assessment of the customer s financial condition and the length of time a receivable is past due 
at november   our allowance for doubtful accounts was  or approximately of our aggregate accounts receivable 
in determining the adequacy of this allowance  we have assumed that market conditions in the telecommunications equipment industry will continue to improve throughout fiscal if this improvement does not occur  or if current market conditions deteriorate  our customers may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us 
accordingly  our estimate of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
at november   we had recorded inventory reserves in the aggregate amount of million for excess and slow moving items 
in determining the adequacy of these reserves  we considered numerous factors including current customer forecasts and estimated usage 
should these forecasts and estimates change due to market  technological or other factors  the net realizable value of our inventories may be materially less than our current carrying values 
we review goodwill for possible impairment at least annually 
impairment losses are recognized when the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is contingent upon many factors  including estimates of future discounted operating cash flows 
long lived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever indicators of possible impairment exist 
impairments are recognized when the expected future operating cash flows derived from such assets are less than their carrying values 
no impairment losses have been recognized in any of the periods presented herein 
however  our future cash flow expectations assume that market conditions throughout the telecommunications equipment industry will improve and conditions throughout the military aerospace sector will continue to be strong 
if long term market conditions do not improve  or in fact deteriorate  our long lived assets may become materially impaired 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion of the asset may not be realized 
presently  we believe that all deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized and a valuation allowance is not required 
we evaluate the need for valuation allowances on a regular basis and make adjustments as needed 
these adjustments  when made  may have a materially negative impact on our financial statements
