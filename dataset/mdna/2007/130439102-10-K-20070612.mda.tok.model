item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for information related to sales by geographic region 
manufacturing we use several wafer foundries in asia and united states 
we use third party independent subcontractors to perform assembly  testing and packaging of products 
these partners are located in thailand  china  philippines  india  and malaysia 
a limited number of products ship to customers in wafer form and that processing takes place in china and thailand 
in october  we discontinued manufacturing semiconductor wafers in our tempe facility and subsequently sold the tempe facility to microchip technology in june we have now completed the transition to a fully fabless business model 
at march  and march   approximately and million of our net fixed assets representing manufacturing equipment consigned to our contract wafer manufacturers  assemblers and test houses  resided in asia primarily in thailand 
in addition  a substantial portion of our inventory also resided in asia as of march  and march  research and development our research and development programs consist primarily of developing new products and processes in response to identified market needs 
additionally  we redesign existing products to reduce costs and enhance their capabilities and performance  or to make them capable of being produced in multiple foundries 
the majority of our design activity is conducted at our headquarters in milpitas  california 
we also have a small analog design center in taiwan which contributes to the design efforts for our white led drivers for the mobile handset market 
we have continued to upgrade our engineering resource and plan to add additional engineers 
we also use contract engineering services for certain specialized design work 
we spent approximately  and million on research and development activities in fiscal  and intellectual property we rely on trade secrets  close customer relationships and being designed into our customers products to protect our market position 
our policy is to apply for patent protection for our unique products and manufacturing processes where that protection is warranted 
as of march   we had been granted approximately us patents  a substantial portion of which relate to current and planned protection devices 
our patents are generally of limited importance to us due in part to the variety of our products versus the limited scope of our patents  the limited lifespan of certain of our products and the ability of our competitors to design around our patents 
process technologies are more often designated as trade secrets 
we protect our trade secrets by having our employees sign confidentiality and non disclosure agreements as part of our personnel policy 
we selectively register our mask works 
it is not our intention to rely solely on protection of intellectual property rights to deter competition 
however  when and where appropriate  we have taken aggressive action to protect our intellectual property rights 
asip  centurion  picoguard  mediaguard  optiguard and our corporate logo are our trademarks and flexboost  praetorian  and photonic are our registered trademarks 
competition competition is based on a number of factors  including price  product performance  form factor  time to market  established customer relationships  manufacturing capabilities  product development and customer support 
we face different competitors in each of the core markets we serve 
with respect to the protection devices for the mobile handset  digital consumer electronics and personal computer markets  we compete with on semiconductor corporation  nxp  semtech corporation and stmicroelectronics  nv for emi filter devices used in mobile handsets  we also compete with ceramic devices based on high volume multi layer ceramic capacitor mlcc technology from companies such as amotek company  ltd  avx corporation  innochip technology  inc  murata manufacturing co  ltd  and tdk corp 
with respect to serial interface display controllers  our competitors include toshiba corporation  samsung  sharp electronics corporation  renesas technology  and solomon systech 
our competitors for white led drivers include advanced analogic technologies  inc  linear technology corp  maxim integrated products  inc  national semiconductor corp  and semtech corp 

table of contents our core markets are intensely competitive 
our products are generally not sold pursuant to long term contracts  enabling our customers to switch suppliers if they choose and making us more vulnerable to competitors 
our customers select vendors and products based on a number of factors including product specifications  price and the ability of a vendor to reliably provide high quality product in high volume on a timely basis 
the weighting of these factors varies depending on the specific needs of a customer at any given point in time 
most of our competitors are larger  more vertically integrated and more diversified than we are and  in some cases  may have a lower cost structure than we do 
we compete primarily on the basis of product innovation and responsiveness to changing needs of customer including both product specifications and delivery requirements 
also  since our manufacturing is totally outsourced we believe that in many cases we are able to move more quickly in adopting new manufacturing processes and in moving production to low cost locations 
in addition  since we do not own our own manufacturing facilities we are not faced with their fixed costs when demand is low 
backlog and design wins at march   our backlog amounted to million  compared with backlog of million at march  our backlog on a specific date represents firm orders received from customers for delivery within six months of that date 
our backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period because our customers can cancel their orders or change delivery dates at little or no cost to them 
a reduction of backlog during any particular period  or the failure of our backlog to result in future revenue  could harm our business 
the number of design wins we have secured has increased during each of the past three fiscal years 
while design win trends are a qualitative indicator of future revenue trends  design wins do not correlate directly with revenue  since they vary in size and in some cases may not result in revenue 
inventory  right of return and seasonality our practice is to carry a reasonable amount of inventory located at sub contractors and customers hubs and to require our distributors to carry sufficient inventory in order to meet our customer s delivery requirements in a manner consistent with industry standards 
we typically plan our production and our inventory levels  and the inventory levels of our distributors  based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
therefore  we often order materials and at least partially completed products in anticipation of customer requirements 
in the last few years  there has been a trend toward vendor managed inventory among many large customers 
in such situations  we do not recognize revenue until the customer draws product from that inventory or otherwise becomes obligated to retain our product 
this imposes the burden upon us of carrying additional inventory that is stored on or near our customers premises and is subject in many instances to return to our premises if not used by the customer 
we permit customer and distributor returns under certain circumstances to remain competitive with current industry practices 
our target markets  mobile handsets  digital consumer electronics and personal computers are typically subject to seasonal demand patterns 
demand for our products is typically strongest in our second and third fiscal quarters 
environmental we have ceased manufacturing products ourselves 
previously we were subject to a variety of federal  state and local regulations in connection with the discharge and storage of certain chemicals used in our manufacturing processes 
industrial waste generated at our facilities was either processed prior to discharge or stored in double lined barrels until removed by an independent contractor 
we had obtained all necessary permits for such discharges and storage 
during the closure of our milpitas facility in fiscal  residual contaminants from our operations were detected in concrete and soil samples  which were remediated under a work plan approved by the california state department of toxic substances control dtsc 
the dtsc informed us in a letter dated february  that they had determined that the site does not pose a significant threat to public health and the environment 
however  if other contaminants should later be found at the site  the dtsc or owner could attempt to hold us responsible 
similarly  our tempe facility  which we closed in december  is located in an area of documented regional groundwater contamination 
in addition  with our closure of our tempe facility  we have conducted environmental studies at the site that did not identify any issues  but should contaminants be found at the site at a later date  a government agency or future owner could attempt to hold us responsible 
however  with the completion of our milpitas site remediation and the closure of our tempe facility during fiscal  we now expect our environmental compliance costs to be minimal 

table of contents employees as of march   we had full time and part time employees  including in sales and marketing  in research and development activities  in production operations and in administration 
none of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good

risk factors we wish to caution the reader that the following important risk factors  and those risk factors described elsewhere in this report or our other securities and exchange commission filings  could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in forward looking statements contained in this document and elsewhere 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict 
these fluctuations may cause our stock price to decline 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly for a variety of reasons  including some of those described in the risk factors below  many of which are difficult to control or predict 
while we believe that quarter to quarter and year to year comparisons of our revenue and operating results are not necessarily meaningful or accurate indicators of future performance  our stock price historically has been susceptible to large swings in response to short term fluctuations in our operating results 
should our future operating results fall below our guidance or the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the likelihood of which is increased by the fluctuations in our operating results  the market price of our common stock may decline 
we were almost breakeven in fiscal  incurring quarterly losses in the first and fourth quarters and being profitable in the second and third quarters 
we may not be able to attain or sustain profitability in the future 
we were profitable for the four quarters during fiscal until we sustained a substantial gaap loss of nine cents per share during the first quarter of fiscal this gaap loss would have been a one cent per share profit but for the one time in process research and development charge we incurred due to our acquisition of arques technology  inc we returned to profitability during the second and third quarters of fiscal  followed by a loss during fourth quarter of fiscal there are many factors that affect our ability to sustain profitability including the health of the mobile handset  digital consumer electronics and personal computer markets on which we focus  continued demand for our products from our key customers  availability of capacity from our manufacturing subcontractors  ability to reduce manufacturing costs faster than price decreases thereby attaining a healthy gross margin  continued product innovation and design wins  competition  and our continued ability to manage our operating expenses 
in order to obtain and sustain profitability on a gaap basis in the long term  we will need to continue to grow our business in our core markets and to reduce our product costs rapidly enough to maintain our gross margin 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical  and we may be subject to such cyclicality  which could lead to our incurring losses again 
we currently rely heavily upon a few customers for a large percentage of our net sales 
our revenue would suffer materially were we to lose any one of these customers or lose market share 
our sales strategy has been to focus on customers with large market share in their respective markets 
as a result  we have several large customers 
during fiscal  two customers primarily in the mobile handset market represented of our net sales 
there can be no assurance that these two customers will purchase our products in the future in the quantities we have forecasted  or at all 
during fiscal  one distributor represented more than of our net sales 
if we were to lose this distributor  we might not be able to obtain other distributors to represent us or the new distributors might not have sufficiently strong relationships with the current end customers to maintain our current level of net sales 
additionally  the time and resources involved with the changeover and training could have an adverse impact on our business in the short term 
we currently rely heavily upon a few target markets for the bulk of our sales 
if we are unable to further penetrate the mobile handset  digital consumer electronics and personal computer markets  our revenues could stop growing and might decline leading us to reduce our investment in research and development and marketing 
our revenues in recent periods have been derived from sales to manufacturers of mobile handsets  digital consumer electronics and personal computers and peripherals 
in order for us to be successful  we must continue to penetrate the mobile handset  digital consumer electronics and personal computer markets  both by obtaining more business from our current customers and by obtaining new customers 
due to our narrow market focus  we are susceptible to materially lower revenues due to material adverse changes to one of these markets 
for example  should growth not occur in the markets we have penetrated  our future revenues could be adversely impacted 

table of contents during fiscal  of our revenue was from sales to the mobile handset market 
if sales of mobile handsets decline  and in particular if sales by our mobile handset customers decline  our future revenues could stop growing and might decline 
this might cause us to choose to cut our spending on research and development and marketing to reduce our loss or to avoid operating at a loss which could further adversely affect our future prospects 
we currently depend almost exclusively on our circuit protection devices for all of our revenue 
should the need for such devices decline  for example because of changes in input and output circuitry  our revenues could stop growing and might decline 
our revenues in recent periods have been derived almost exclusively from sales of circuit protection devices 
for example  during fiscal  of our revenue was derived from such sales 
with the acquisition of arques and its product line of led drivers and the introduction of our new serial device controller  we have several products which could help us reduce our dependence upon circuit protection devices  although for the next several years we expect the substantial bulk of our revenues to derive from circuit protection devices 
should the need for such devices decline  for example because of changes in input and output circuitry  our revenues could stop growing and might decline 
the fastest growing market for our products has been the mobile handset market 
a slowdown in the adoption of protection devices by mobile handset manufacturers would reduce our future growth in that market 
much of our revenue growth over the past three years has been in the mobile handset market where more complex mobile handsets have meant increased adoption of and demand for protection devices 
should the rate of adoption of protection devices decelerate in the mobile handset market  our planned rate of increase in penetration of that market would also decrease  thereby reducing our future growth in that market 
the markets in which we participate are intensely competitive and our products are not sold pursuant to long term contracts  enabling our customers to replace us with our competitors if they choose 
our core markets are intensely competitive 
our ability to compete successfully in our core markets depends upon our being able to offer attractive  high quality products to our customers that are properly priced and dependably supplied 
our customer relationships do not generally involve long term binding commitments making it easier for customers to change suppliers and making us more vulnerable to competitors 
our customer relationships instead depend upon our past performance for the customer  their perception of our ability to meet their future need  including price and delivery and the timely development of new devices  the lead time to qualify a new supplier for a particular product  and interpersonal relationships and trust 
furthermore  many of our customers are striving to limit the number of vendors they do business with and because of our small size and limited product portfolio they could decide to stop doing business with us 
because we operate in different semiconductor product markets  we generally encounter different competitors in our various market areas 
with respect to the protection devices for the mobile handset  digital consumer electronics and personal computer markets  we compete with on semiconductor corporation  nxp  semtech corporation and stmicroelectronics  nv for emi filter devices used in mobile handsets  we also compete with ceramic devices based on high volume multi layer ceramic capacitor mlcc technology from companies such as amotek company  ltd  avx corporation  innochip technology  inc  murata manufacturing co  ltd  and tdk corp 
mlcc devices are generally low cost and our revenues would suffer if their features and performance meet the requirements of our customers and we are unable to reduce the cost of our protection products sufficiently to be competitive 
we continue to see ceramic filters obtain significant design wins for low end applications in the mobile handset market 
we have also seen the use of higher performance ceramic filters and if we are not able to demonstrate superior performance at an acceptable price with our devices then our revenues would also suffer 
with respect to serial interface display controllers  our competitors include toshiba corporation  samsung  sharp electronics corporation  renesas technology  and solomon systech 
our competitors for white led drivers include advanced analogic technologies  inc  linear technology corp  maxim integrated products  inc  national semiconductor corp  and semtech corp 
many of our competitors are larger than we are  have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources than we do and have their own facilities for the production of semiconductor components 
one of our competitive advantages for our mobile handset protection devices may be lessening as some of our customers choose to use package devices rather than csp 
this could lead to our customers purchasing products from our competitors rather than us or to our having to reduce prices  thereby decreasing our revenues 
among our competitive advantages for our protection devices  which comprise the dominant portion of our products sold in the mobile handset market  has been our rapid adoption of csp with respect to which our early entry and high volume has allowed us to gain advantage over competitors 

table of contents certain customers have indicated a preference for the use of plastic packages rather than csp and the relative percentage of our handset protection products using csp has declined by approximately during fiscal as compared to last year 
should this preference become more widespread  then packaging could cease to give us a competitive advantage and could even become an area in which we are somewhat competitively disadvantaged  since some of our competitors have high volume internal packaging operations  unless we are able to match their capabilities and cost structure using merchant suppliers 
this could lead to our losing sales or to reducing prices  thereby decreasing our revenues 
we determined that we had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of march   one of which was still continuing as of december  as a result  we had to implement supplemental compensating procedures to determine that our financial statements are reliable 
these material weaknesses  and any future adjustment to our financial statements which may result from them  could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  beginning with our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ending march   and annually thereafter  we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting 
such report will contain  among other matters  a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
such report must also contain a statement that our auditors have issued an attestation report on management s assessment of such internal controls 
as of march   management identified  and the auditors attested to  material weaknesses in the company s internal control over financial reporting in the operating effectiveness within a portion of the revenue cycle and in the controls over the proper recognition of subcontractor invoices related to inventory and accounts payable 
although management believed it had subsequently remediated these material weaknesses  it was later discovered that they continued through the third quarter of fiscal management subsequently assessed and determined  and the auditors attested  that these material weaknesses had been remediated as of march   and however  should we or our auditors discover that we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting at another time in the future  especially considering that we have had material weaknesses in the past which we incorrectly believed had been remediated  investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
deficiencies in our internal controls could cause us to have material errors in our financial statements  which could require us to restate them 
such restatement could have adverse consequences on our stock price  potentially limiting our access to financial markets 
during our internal control assessment as of march   we determined that we had two material weaknesses in our internal controls 
one common link in our two restatements and our continuing material weakness involves difficulties with our inventory costing system and operating expense determinations due to accounts payable issues at the end of a fiscal period 
while the design and operation of our new oracle erp system combined with our new clerical personnel  enhanced training  and management oversight  and the other remediation steps we took helped us improve our internal control over our business and financial processes to the extent we concluded in our assessments for fiscal and that we no longer had any material weaknesses  there can be no assurance that we will nonetheless not have an error in our financial statements 
such an error  if material  could require their restatement  having adverse effects on our stock price  potentially causing additional expense  and could limit our access to financial markets 
our competitors have in the past and may in the future reverse engineer our most successful products and become second sources for our customers  which could decrease our revenues and gross margins 
our most successful products are not covered by patents and have in the past and may in the future be reverse engineered 
thus  our competitors can become second sources of these products for our customers or our customers competitors  which could decrease our unit sales or our ability to increase unit sales and also could lead to price competition 
this price competition could result in lower prices for our products  which would also result in lower revenues and gross margins 
certain of our competitors have announced products that are pin compatible with some of our most successful products  especially in the mobile handset market  where many of our largest revenue generating products have been second sourced 
to the extent that the revenue secured by these competitors exceeds the expansion in market size resulting from the availability of second sources  this decreases the revenue potential for our products 
furthermore  should a second source vendor attempt to increase its market share by dramatic or predatory price cuts for large revenue products  our revenues and margins could decline materially 

table of contents in the future our revenues will become increasingly subject to macroeconomic cycles and more likely to decline if there is an economic downturn 
as mobile handset protection devices penetration increases  our revenues will become increasingly susceptible to macroeconomic cycles because our revenue growth may become more dependent on growth in the overall market rather than primarily on increased penetration  as has been the case in the past 
our reliance on foreign customers could cause fluctuations in our operating results 
during fiscal  international sales accounted for of our net sales 
international sales include sales to us based customers if the product was delivered outside the united states 
international sales subject us to the following risks changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  timing and availability of export licenses  political and economic instability  the impact of regional and global illnesses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome infections sars  difficulties in accounts receivable collections  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  difficulties in managing distributors  difficulties in obtaining foreign governmental approvals  if those approvals should become required for any of our products  limited intellectual property protection  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  the burden of complying with and the risk of violating a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
because sales of our products have been denominated in united states dollars  increases in the value of the us dollar could increase the relative price of our products so that they become more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country 
furthermore  because some of our customer purchase orders and agreements are influenced  if not governed  by foreign laws  we may be limited in our ability to enforce our rights under these agreements and to collect damages  if awarded 
if our distributors experience financial difficulty and become unable to pay us or choose not to promote our products  our business could be harmed 
during fiscal  of our sales were through distributors  primarily in asia 
our distributors could reduce or discontinue sales of our products or sell our competitors products 
they may not devote the resources necessary to sell our products in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect 
in addition  we are dependent on their continued financial viability  and some of them are small companies with limited working capital 
if our distributors experience financial difficulties and become unable to pay our invoices  or otherwise become unable or unwilling to promote and sell our products  our business could be harmed 

table of contents our dependence on a limited number of foundry partners and csp ball drop contractors  and the limited capacity for plastic assembly and test subcontractors  exposes us to a risk of manufacturing disruption or uncontrolled price changes 
given the current size of our business  we believe it is impractical for us to use more than a limited number of foundry partners and csp ball drop subcontractors as it would lead to significant increases in our costs 
currently  we have three foundry partners and rely on two csp ball drop subcontractors 
some of our products are sole sourced at one of our foundry partners in china or japan 
csp ball drop is a key step in the csp used for the bulk of our mobile handset products 
currently  there are only a limited number of suppliers of this service and we currently use two of them 
there is also a limited capacity of plastic assembly and test contractors  especially for tdfn and udfn packaging  for which customer demand is increasing 
our ability to secure sufficient plastic assembly and test capacity  especially the fast ramping tdfn and udfn offerings  may limit our ability to satisfy our customers demand 
if the operations of one or more of our partners or subcontractors should be disrupted  or if they should choose not to devote capacity to our products in a timely manner  our business could be adversely impacted as we might be unable to manufacture some of our products on a timely basis 
in addition  the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry has periodically resulted in shortages of wafer fabrication  assembly and test capacity and other disruption of supply 
we may not be able to find sufficient capacity at a reasonable price or at all if such disruptions occur 
as a result  we face significant risks  including reduced control over delivery schedules and quality  longer lead times  the impact of regional and global illnesses such as sars or avian flu pandemic  the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods when industry demand exceeds available capacity  difficulties finding and integrating new subcontractors  limited warranties on products supplied to us  potential increases in prices due to capacity shortages  currency exchange fluctuations and other factors  and potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
we have outsourced our wafer fabrication  and assembly and test operations and may encounter difficulties in expanding our capacity 
we have adopted a fabless manufacturing model that involves the use of foundry partners and assembly and test subcontractors to provide our production capacity 
we chose this model in order to reduce our overall manufacturing costs and thereby increase our gross margin  reduce the impact of fixed costs when volume is low  provide us with upside capacity in case of short term demand increases and provide us with access to newer process technology  production facilities and equipment 
during the past four years we have outsourced our wafer manufacturing and assembly and test operations overseas in asia and we continue to seek additional foundry and assembly and test capacity to provide for growth 
if we experience delays in securing additional or replacement capacity at the time we need it  we may not have sufficient product to fully meet the demand of our customers 
our reliance upon foreign suppliers exposes us to risks associated with international operations 
we use foundry partners and assembly and test subcontractors in asia  primarily in china  japan  india  thailand  and taiwan for our products 
our dependence on these foundries and subcontractors involves the following substantial risks political and economic instability  changes in our cost structure due to changes in local currency values relative to the us dollar  
table of contents potential difficulty in enforcing agreements and recovering damages for their breach  inability to obtain and retain manufacturing capacity and priority for our business  especially during industry wide times of capacity shortages  exposure to greater risk of misappropriation of intellectual property  disruption to air transportation from asia  and changes in tax laws  tariffs and freight rates 
these risks may lead to delayed product delivery or increased costs  which would harm our profitability  financial results and customer relationships 
in addition  we maintain significant inventory at our foreign subcontractors that could be at risk 
we also drop ship product from some of these foreign subcontractors directly to customers 
this increases our exposure to disruptions in operations that are not under our direct control and may require us to enhance our computer and information systems to coordinate this remote activity 
we have consigned substantial equipment at our foreign subcontractors in order to obtain price concessions 
we are at risk for this equipment should the foreign subcontractor go out of business 
in order to obtain price concessions  we have consigned substantial equipment at our foreign contractors 
for example  we have million of test and packaging equipment on consignment in india and million of test equipment on consignment in thailand as of march  should our business relationship with these partners cease  whether due to our switching to alternate lower cost suppliers  quality or capacity issues with our current partners  or if they experience a natural disaster or financial difficulty  we may have trouble repossessing this equipment 
even if we are able to repossess this equipment  it may not be in good condition and we may not be able to realize the dollar value of this equipment then recorded on our books 
any such inability to repossess consigned equipment or to realize its recorded value on our books would reduce our assets 
our markets are subject to rapid technological change 
therefore  our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  changing customer needs  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  increased integration with other functions  and rapid product obsolescence 
our competitors or customers may offer new products based on new technologies  industry standards or end user or customer requirements  including products that have the potential to replace or provide lower cost or higher performance alternatives to our products 
the introduction of new products by our competitors or customers could render our existing and future products obsolete or unmarketable 
in addition  our competitors and customers may introduce products that eliminate the need for our products 
our customers are constantly developing new products that are more complex and miniature  increasing the pressure on us to develop products to address the increasingly complex requirements of our customers products in environments in which power usage  lack of interference with neighboring devices and miniaturization are increasingly important 
to develop new products for our core markets  we must develop  gain access to  and use new technologies in a cost effective and timely manner  and continue to expand our technical and design expertise 
in addition  we must have our products designed into our customers future products and maintain close working relationships with key customers in order to develop new products that meet their changing needs 

table of contents we may not be able to identify new product opportunities  to develop or use new technologies successfully  to develop and bring to market new products  or to respond effectively to new technological changes or product announcements by our competitors 
there can be no assurance even if we are able to do so that our customers will design our products into their products or that our customers products will achieve market acceptance 
our pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense and involve engineering risk 
failure in any of these areas could harm our operating results 
it is possible that a significant portion our research and development expenditures will not yield products with meaningful future revenue 
we are attempting to develop one or more new mixed signal integrated circuit products as well as photonic products resulting from our acquisition of arques  which have a higher development cost than our protection device products 
this limits how many of such products we can undertake at any one time increasing our risk that such efforts will not result in a working product for which there is a substantial demand at a price which will yield good margins 
we are engaging third parties to assist us with these developments and have also added personnel with new skills to our engineering group 
these third parties and new personnel may not be successful 
these new product developments involve technology in which we have less expertise which also increases the risk of failure 
on the other hand  we believe that the potential payoff from these products makes it reasonable for us to take such risks 
even if our devices work as planned  we may not have success with them in the market 
this risk is greater than with our protection device products because many of these new devices are product types for which we don t have material customer traction or market experience 
we may be unable to reduce the costs associated with our products quickly enough for us to meet our margin targets or to retain market share 
in the mobile handset market our competitors have been second sourcing many of our products and as a result this market has become more price competitive 
we are seeing the same trend develop in our low capacitance esd devices for digital consumer electronics  personal computers and peripherals 
we need to be able to reduce the costs associated with our products in order to achieve our target gross margins 
we have in the past achieved and may attempt in the future to achieve cost reductions by obtaining reduced prices from our manufacturing subcontractors  using larger sized wafers  adopting simplified processes  and redesigning parts to require fewer pins or to make them smaller 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving cost reductions through any of these methods  in which case we will experience lower margins and or we will experience lower sales as our customers switch to our competitors 
our future success depends in part on the continued service of our key engineering and management personnel and our ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel 
in the finance area  we have had significant recent turnover and lack of continuity which could be detrimental in the short term to our business decision making capability and to consistency in our financial reporting 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry  in particular for the highly skilled design  applications and test engineers involved in the development of new analog integrated circuits 
competition is especially intense in the san francisco bay area  where our corporate headquarters and engineering group is located 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel who may leave our employ in the future 
this is especially true for analog chip designers since competition is fierce for experienced engineers in this discipline 
growth is expected to place increased demands on our resources and will likely require the addition of management and engineering personnel  and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 
the loss of services and or changes in our management team  in particular our ceo  or our key engineers  or the failure to recruit or retain other key technical and management personnel  could cause additional expense  potentially reduce the efficiency of our operations and could harm our business 
during fiscal  we hired new vice presidents of engineering and sales and a material portion of our future success will depend upon their performance 
in addition  we have recently replaced our three most senior finance positions chief financial officer  corporate controller  and director of financial planning operations controller so our ability to train and integrate these persons is critical and the lack of continuity and institutional knowledge could be detrimental in the short term to our business decision making capability and to consistency in our financial reporting 

table of contents we are dependent upon retaining key employees of recently acquired arques technology in order to realize many of the hoped for benefits of the acquisition 
our ability to realize revenue from the arques assets is dependent upon arques personnel remaining company employees and successfully completing the products under development and helping integrate arques technology into planned company products 
many of these arques personnel are located in taiwan and are experiencing cultural differences in addition to being associated with an established company instead of a start up 
should certain of the key former arques employees choose to leave the company  we might not be able to complete the current products under development and the planned company products incorporating arques technology  which could cause us to not realize expected revenue and could adversely affect the market for our stock 
we may not be successful in selling white led driver products which were designed by arques technology or which we subsequently develop based on their technology 
this would reduce incremental income we are planning to obtain 
we have previously not marketed a white led driver 
we now are starting to market a family of white led drivers resulting from our acquisition of arques technology 
the market for white led drivers for mobile handsets is intensely competitive with a growing number of new entrants 
we may be unsuccessful in developing and offering products that leverage our customer relationships and are sufficiently attractive to become a viable vendor for white led drivers 
when we acquired arques technology  inc in april   we recorded approximately million as goodwill on our balance sheet 
we may incur an impairment charge to the extent we determine that we no longer have substantial goodwill as an enterprise 
when we acquired arques technology  inc in april   we recognized approximately million as goodwill on our balance sheet 
we acquired this company for several reasons  including obtaining additional products  a proven analog design team  and a more visible asian presence  and therefore consider the acquisition to have been a success 
however  under gaap  we will need to incur an impairment charge to the extent we determine that we no longer have substantial goodwill as an enterprise  which would be the case if our market capitalization no longer materially exceeded the book value of our assets or product development is discontinued 
we are required to make such an assessment of our enterprise goodwill at least annually 
any such impairment charge will correspondingly decrease our profitability and could lead to a decline in our stock price 
due to the volatility of demand for our products  our inventory may from time to time be in excess of our needs  which could cause write downs of our inventory or of inventory held by our distributors 
generally our products are sold pursuant to short term releases of customer purchase orders and some orders must be filled on an expedited basis 
our backlog is subject to revisions and cancellations and anticipated demand is constantly changing 
because of the short life cycles involved with our customers products  the order pattern from individual customers can be erratic  with inventory accumulation and liquidation during phases of the life cycle for our customers products 
we face the risk of inventory write offs if we manufacture products in advance of orders 
however  if we do not make products in advance of orders  we may be unable to fulfill some or all of the demand to the detriment of our customer relationships because we have insufficient inventory on hand and at our distributors to fill unexpected orders and because the time required to make the product may be longer than the time that certain customers will wait for the product 
we typically plan our production and our inventory levels  and the inventory levels of our distributors  based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
therefore  we often order materials and at least partially fabricate product in anticipation of customer requirements 
furthermore  due to long manufacturing lead times  in order to respond in a timely manner to customer demand  we may also make products or have products made in advance of orders to keep in our inventory  and we may encourage our distributors to order and stock products in advance of orders that are subject to their right to return them to us 
in the last few years  there has been a trend toward vendor managed inventory among some large customers 
in such situations  we do not recognize revenue until the customer withdraws inventory from stock or otherwise becomes obligated to retain our product 
this imposes the burden upon us of carrying additional inventory that is stored on or near our customers premises and is subject in many instances to return to our premises if not used by the customer 
we value our inventories on a part by part basis to appropriately consider excess inventory levels and obsolete inventory primarily based on backlog and forecasted customer demand  and to consider reductions in sales price 
for the reasons described above  we may end up carrying more inventory than we need in order to meet our customers orders  in which case we may incur charges when we write down the excess inventory to its net realizable value  if any  should our customers for whatever reason not order the product in our inventory 

table of contents our design wins may not result in customer products utilizing our devices and our backlog may not result in future shipments of our devices 
during a typical quarter  a substantial portion of our shipments are not in our backlog at the start of the quarter  which limits our ability to forecast in the near term 
we count as a design win each decision by one of our customers to use one of our parts in one of their products that  based on their projected usage  will generate more than  of sales annually for us when their product is in production 
not all of the design wins that we recognize will result in revenue as a customer may cancel an end product for a variety of reasons or subsequently decide not to use our part in it 
even if the customer s end product does go into production with our part  it may not result in annual product sales of  by us and the customer s product may have a shorter life than expected 
in addition  the length of time from design win to production will vary based on the customer s development schedule 
finally  the revenue from design wins varies significantly 
consequently  the number of design wins we obtain is not a quantitative indicator of our future sales 
due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders  our backlog at any particular point in time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
a reduction of backlog during any particular period  or the failure of our backlog to result in future shipments  could harm our business 
much of our revenue is based upon orders placed with us that have short lead time until delivery or sales by our distributors to their customers in most cases  we do not recognize revenue on sales to our distributors until the distributor sells the product to its customers 
as a result  our ability to forecast our future shipments and our ability to increase manufacturing capacity quickly may limit our ability to fulfill customer orders with short lead times 
the majority of our operating expenses cannot be reduced quickly in response to revenue shortfalls without impairing our ability to effectively conduct business 
the majority of our operating expenses are labor related and therefore cannot be reduced quickly without impairing our ability to effectively conduct business 
much of the remainder of our operating costs such as rent is relatively fixed 
therefore  we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
consequently  our operating results will be harmed if our revenues do not meet our projections 
we may experience revenue shortfalls for the following and other reasons significant pricing pressures that occur because of competition or customer demands  sudden shortages of raw materials or fabrication  test or assembly capacity constraints that lead our suppliers to allocate available supplies or capacity to other customers and  in turn  harm our ability to meet our sales obligations  and rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders due to a softening of the demand for our customers products  replacement of our parts by our competitors or other reasons 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights adequately 
our ability to compete is affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  mask work registrations  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and nondisclosure and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite these efforts  the steps we take to protect our proprietary information may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology  and our competitors may independently develop technology that is substantially similar or superior to our technology 
to the limited extent that we are able to seek patent protection for our products or processes  our pending patent applications or any future applications may not be approved 
any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties 
if challenged  our patents may be found to be invalid or unenforceable  and the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar products or processes  duplicate our products or processes  or design around any patents that may be issued to us 

table of contents we could be harmed by litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
as a general matter  the semiconductor and related industries are characterized by substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties 
furthermore  we may have certain indemnification obligations to customers with respect to the infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products 
infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers or end users of our products resulting from infringement claims may be asserted in the future and such assertions  if proven to be true  may harm our business 
any litigation relating to the intellectual property rights of third parties  whether or not determined in our favor or settled by us  would at a minimum be costly and could divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel 
in the event of any adverse ruling in any such litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacturing  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain a license under the intellectual property rights of the third party claiming infringement 
a license might not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
by supplying parts in the past which were used in medical devices that help sustain human life  we are vulnerable to product liability claims 
we have in the past supplied products predominantly to guidant and to a much lesser extent to medtronic for use in implantable defibrillators and pacemakers  which help sustain human life 
while we have not sold products into the medical market since fiscal year  large numbers of our products are or will be used in implanted medical devices  which could fail and expose us to claims 
should our products cause failure in the implanted devices  we may be sued and ultimately have liability  although under federal law guidant and medtronic would be required to defend and take responsibility in such instances until their liability was established  in which case we could be liable for that part of those damages caused by our willful misconduct or  in the case of medtronic only  our negligence 
our failure to comply with environmental regulations could result in substantial liability to us 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations relating to the protection of health and the environment 
these include laws  rules and regulations governing the use  storage  discharge  release  treatment and disposal of hazardous chemicals during and after manufacturing  research and development and sales demonstrations  as well as the maintenance of healthy and environmentally sound conditions within our facilities 
if we fail to comply with applicable requirements  we could be subject to substantial liability for cleanup efforts  property damage  personal injury and fines or suspension or cessation of our operations 
in these regards  during the closure of our milpitas facility in fiscal  residual contaminants from our operations were detected in concrete and soil samples which were remediated under a work plan approved the state department of toxic substances control dtsc 
the dtsc informed us in a letter dated february   that they had determined that the site does not pose significant threat to public health and the environment 
however  if other contaminants should later be found at the site  the dtsc or owner could attempt to hold us responsible 
similarly  our tempe facility  which we closed in december  is located in an area of documented regional groundwater contamination 
while we have no reason to believe that our operations at the facility have contributed to this regional contamination  we can give no assurance that this is the case 
in connection with our closure of this facility  we have conducted environmental studies at the site that did not identify any issues but should contaminants be found at the site at a later date a government agency or the new owner could attempt to hold us responsible 
under the agreement  we retain liability for any environmental issues that arise due to the condition of the property at the time of closing 
earthquakes  other natural disasters and shortages may damage our business 
our california facilities and some of our suppliers are located near major earthquake faults that have experienced earthquakes in the past 
in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster near our headquarters  our operations could be harmed 
similarly  a major earthquake or other natural disaster near one or more of our major suppliers  like the ones that occurred in taiwan in september and in japan in october  could disrupt the operations of those suppliers  limit the supply of our products and harm our business 
the october earthquake in japan temporarily shut down operations at one of the wafer fabrication facilities at which our products were being produced 
we have since transferred that capacity to other fabs 
power shortages have occurred in california in the past 
we cannot assure that if power interruptions or shortages occur in the future  they will not adversely affect our business 

table of contents future terrorist activity  or threat of such activity  could adversely impact our business 
the september  attack may have adversely affected the demand for our customers products  which in turn reduced their demand for our products 
in addition  terrorist activity interfered with communications and transportation networks  which adversely affected us 
future terrorist activity could similarly adversely impact our business 
implementation of the new fasb rules for the accounting of employee equity and the issuance of new laws or other accounting regulations  or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations  could materially impact our business or stated results 
from time to time  the government  courts and financial accounting boards issue new laws or accounting regulations  or modify or reinterpret existing ones 
for example  starting with the first quarter of fiscal  we implemented financial accounting standards board fasb financial accounting standard r for the accounting for share based payments 
these regulations cause us to recognize an expense associated with our employee and director stock options and our employee stock purchase plan which will decrease our earnings 
we have chosen to have lower earnings rather than not to use options as widely for our employees  which we believe would adversely impact our ability to hire and retain key employees 
during fiscal  we incurred approximately an extra  of expenses due to fas r  which is cents per share 
another example may be fasb interpretation described in note which we are currently evaluating and which could impact our balance sheet or statement of operations in a material and adverse manner  for instance by causing us to recognize additional expense or to accrue an additional liability 
there may be other future changes in laws  interpretations or regulations that would affect our financial results or the way in which we present them 
additionally  changes in the laws or regulations could have adverse effects on hiring and many other aspects of our business that would affect our ability to compete  both nationally and internationally 
our stock price may continue to be volatile  and our trading volume may continue to be relatively low and limit liquidity and market efficiency 
should significant shareholders desire to sell their shares within a short period of time  our stock price could decline 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly 
in the future  the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to general market conditions and in response to quarter to quarter variations in our anticipated or actual operating results  announcements or introductions of new products by us or our competitors  technological innovations or setbacks by us or our competitors  conditions in the semiconductor and passive components markets  the commencement of litigation  changes in estimates of our performance by securities analysts  announcements of merger or acquisition transactions  and general economic and market conditions 
in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many high technology companies  particularly semiconductor companies  that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic and market conditions  may harm the market price of our common stock 
furthermore  our trading volume is often small  meaning that a few trades have disproportionate influence on our stock price 
in addition  someone seeking to liquidate a sizable position in our stock may have difficulty doing so except over an extended period or privately at a discount 
thus  if a shareholder were to sell or attempt to sell a large number of its shares within a short period of time  this sale or attempt could cause our stock price to decline 
our stock is followed by a relatively small number of analysts and any changes in their rating of our stock could cause significant swings in its market price 

table of contents our shareholder rights plan  together with the anti takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation  may delay  defer or prevent a change of control 
our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan in autumn to encourage third parties interested in acquiring us to work with and obtain the support of our board of directors 
the effect of the rights plan is that any person who does not obtain the support of our board of directors for its proposed acquisition of us would suffer immediate dilution upon achieving ownership of more than of our stock 
under the rights plan  we have issued rights to purchase shares of our preferred stock that are redeemable by us prior to a triggering event for a nominal amount at any time and that accompany each of our outstanding common shares 
these rights are triggered if a third party acquires more than of our stock without board of director approval 
if triggered  these rights entitle our shareholders  other than the third party causing the rights to be triggered  to purchase shares of the company s preferred stock at what is expected to be a relatively low price 
in addition  these rights may be exchanged for common stock under certain circumstances if permitted by the board of directors 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges and restrictions  including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be harmed by  the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future  including the preferred shares covered by the shareholder rights plan 
the issuance of preferred stock may delay  defer or prevent a change in control 
the terms of the preferred stock that might be issued could potentially make more difficult or expensive our consummation of any merger  reorganization  sale of substantially all of our assets  liquidation or other extraordinary corporate transaction 
in addition  the issuance of preferred stock could have a dilutive effect on our shareholders 
further  our shareholders must give written notice delivered to our executive offices no less than days before the one year anniversary of the date our proxy statement was released to shareholders in connection with the previous year s annual meeting to nominate a candidate for director or present a proposal to our shareholders at a meeting 
these notice requirements could inhibit a takeover by delaying shareholder action 
the california corporation law also restricts business combinations with some shareholders once the shareholder acquires or more of our common stock 
we will incur increased costs as a result of recently enacted and proposed changes in laws and regulations relating to corporate governance matters and public disclosure 
recently enacted and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  rules adopted or proposed by the sec and by the nasdaq national market and new accounting pronouncements will result in increased costs to us as we evaluate the implications of these laws  regulations and standards and respond to their requirements 
to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure  we intend to invest substantial resources to comply with evolving standards 
this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from strategic revenue generating and cost management activities 
for example  we spent approximately an incremental  versus our prior financial audit only fees on internal control documentation  testing  and auditing to complete our first annual review associated with filing of k for the year ended march  to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
we also spend a significant but not separately determinable amount in fiscal and fiscal in internal control documentation  testing  and auditing 
in addition  these new laws and regulations could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  on our board committees or as executive officers 
we are taking steps to comply with the recently enacted laws and regulations in accordance with the deadlines by which compliance is required  but cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs that we may incur to respond to their requirements 
our acquisition of arques technology and any future acquisitions and strategic alliances may harm our operating results or cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities 
in april   we acquired arques technology  inc and we may in the future acquire  or form strategic alliances relating to  other businesses  products and technologies 
successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require  among other things  efficient integration and alignment of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts 
we have no recent experience in making such acquisitions or alliances 
the difficulties of integration and alignment may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations  the complexity of the technologies being integrated and aligned and the necessity of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures 

table of contents in the case of arques  we need to complete the development of several products and  to be cost effective  we need to make their products using our supply chain  both of which will take significant effort on our part and involve technical and economic risk 
furthermore  the arques product designs involve analog engineering while our expertise is primarily in integrated passive device design digital signal processing 
in addition  most of their personnel are located in taiwan which adds to the challenge of making them feel part of our corporate culture 
the integration and alignment of operations following an acquisition or alliance requires the dedication of management resources that may distract attention from the day to day business  and may disrupt key research and development  marketing or sales efforts 
in the case of arques  for sixteen quarters  we will incur expenses of  as we amortize the acquired developed and core technology and for eight quarters we will incur expense of  as we amortize the acquired distributor relationships 
in connection with future acquisitions and alliances  we may not only acquire assets which need to be amortized  but we may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities which could harm our operating results 
without strategic acquisitions and alliances we may have difficulty meeting future customer product and service requirements 
a decline in our stock price could result in securities class action litigation against us which could divert management attention and harm our business 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against public companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
due in part to our historical stock price volatility  we could in the future be a target of such litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could harm our ability to execute our business plan

we sell to some of these end customers through original design manufacturers odms and contract electronics manufacturers cems 
we use a direct sales force  manufacturers representatives and distributors to sell our products 
we use foundry partners and assembly and test subcontractors located in foreign countries including thailand  china  japan  india  philippines and taiwan  for our products 
most of our physical assets are located outside the united states including product inventories and manufacturing equipment consigned to our contract wafer manufacturers  assemblers and test houses 

table of contents industry overview the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  price erosion  periodic oversupply conditions  occasional shortages of materials  capacity constraints  variation in manufacturing efficiencies and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development 
market disruptions caused by new technologies  entry of new competitors into markets we serve  and other factors introduce volatility into our operating performance and cash flow from operations 
fiscal key financial highlights the following are key financial highlights  net sales of million our net sales were million in  down from million in primarily due to reduced sales in the mobile handset market partially offset by an increase in sales in the digital consumer electronics and personal computer market 
gross margin of million our gross margin was million of our net sales in fiscal as compared to gross margin of million of our net sales a year ago 
net loss that rounds to per share our net loss was  which rounds to a net loss per share  basic and diluted  of in fiscal our net income per share  basic and diluted  was and respectively in fiscal cash provided by operating activities of million we generated operating cash inflow of million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash position we ended the fiscal year with a net cash position of million as compared to million  a year ago 
despite our cash outflows for our acquisition of arques and investment in test and packaging equipment consigned to spel of approximately million and million  respectively  during fiscal  our net cash position remained at a level consistent with the last year 
net cash cash and cash equivalents short term investments major accomplishments in fiscal in fiscal we experienced growth in low capacitance esd revenue  representing of total revenue in fiscal we introduced second generation mediaguard port protection devices  introduced a serial interface display controller for mobile handsets with initial design wins including the first for our new serial interface display controller from a top five mobile handset manufacturer and an expansion of leadership praetorian line of emi filters with the most compact footprint for mobile handsets 
we continued to invest in new products and are committed to investing in research  development and engineering in order to provide our customers with a new generation of products 
we set a new record in fiscal with  design wins  up from fiscal we acquired arques during the first quarter of fiscal the acquisition added a new product line of white led drivers for mobile handsets and double data rate ddr memory voltage regulators for digital consumer electronics products  leveraging arques proprietary flexboost technology 
these product lines are expected to contribute to an anticipated increase in our consolidated revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal additionally  our research and development capabilities have been enhanced with the added expertise of arques workforce 
see note business combinations for further details 
we entered into a joint investment with spel semiconductor to expand cost effective assembly and test capacity for packaged devices 

table of contents future outlook based on our analysis of future customer needs and our recent and anticipated design wins  we expect revenue in fiscal to grow compared to fiscal we expect the market for mobile handset protection devices to grow in fiscal and to be able to stabilize or increase our share of that market 
we also believe that demand for our low capacitance esd protection devices used in digital tvs  other digital consumer electronics products and personal computers will continue to grow 
finally  we expect to be able to secure design wins for our serial interface display controller and white led drivers for mobile handsets and generate revenue from those design wins in fiscal we expect gross margin to increase on a sequential basis during fiscal starting in the second quarter as we implement a variety of cost reductions including migration from six inch to eight inch wafers  more cost effective process technologies and the use of lower cost assembly and test vendors for packaged parts

table of contents net sales net sales by market were as follows in millions year ended march  change change over over over over mobile handset digital consumer electronics and personal computers total core market medical and other products total of revenue mobile handsets digital consumer electronics and personal computers medical and other products fiscal versus net sales for fiscal were million  a decrease of million or from the million of net sales in fiscal sales from products for the mobile handset market decreased by million or for fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of increased competition  lower demand from one of our major customers and decline in asp of our products 
sales from products for the digital consumer electronics and personal computer market increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  up by million or  which was primarily driven by increased sales of our low capacitance esd products 
our overall asp declined to in fiscal from in fiscal of this decline  approximately represented the weighted average price decline on a constant mix of products that were sold in both periods and the remaining of the decline was due to changes in product mix 
in the future we expect our asp for similar products based on a constant mix to decline at a rate of approximately per year 
however  we expect higher asp of our new products to help offset this trend 
in fiscal the number of units sold increased to million units from million units in fiscal however  there was a marked shift from csp to package parts in shipments of our products for the mobile handset market during fiscal sales of packaged parts for the mobile handset market increased to in from in fiscal versus net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million or from the million of net sales in fiscal sales from products for the mobile handset market increased million or for fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of increased penetration as measured by the average number of our parts per handset shipped  and secondarily as a result of market growth which offset declines in asp 
sales from products for the digital consumer electronics and personal computer market were up by for fiscal compared to fiscal  which was primarily driven by increased sales of our low capacitance esd protection products 
our revenue growth in our core markets came primarily from existing products  and secondarily from new products

as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal in process research and development in process research and development ipr d expense in fiscal of million was related to the arques acquisition 
there was no in process research and development expense recorded during each of the fiscal years and the value of acquired ipr d was determined based on the expected cash flow attributed to the in process projects  taking into account revenue that was attributable to previously developed technology  the level of effort to date in the in process research and development  the percentage of completion of the project and the level of risk associated with commercializing the in process technology 
the projects identified as in process were those that were underway as of the acquisition date and that will  post acquisition  require additional effort in order to establish technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses 
these projects had identifiable technological risk factors at the time of acquisition that indicated that even though successful completion was expected  it was not assured 

table of contents ipr d was entirely expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
we do not expect future ipr d expenses related to the arques acquisition 
amortization of purchased intangible assets upon arques acquisition during fiscal  we allocated fair value of  and  to purchased intangible assets  namely developed and core technology and distributor relationships  respectively 
developed and core technology and distributor relationships are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives of four years and two years  respectively 
we recorded amortization expense of  in fiscal there were no such charges recorded in fiscal and for further discussion of purchased intangible assets  see note business combinations 
restructuring charges on october  our board of directors approved a plan to close our manufacturing operation in tempe  arizona and other associated activities

there is no more restructuring expense associated with the closure of our tempe facility 
other income  net other income  net mainly includes interest income  interest expense and debt amortization costs 
the increase in other income  net in fiscal is primarily due to increase in interest income and reduction of our interest expenses during fiscal as compared to fiscal the interest income increased to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs for fiscal was approximately  as compared to  for fiscal the increase in interest income resulted from increased interest rate and our having higher average cash balance as a result of positive cash flow from operations and issuance of common stock under our employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans partially offset by cash outflow for our investing activities 
there has been decrease in interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the expiry of the credit line of million with silicon valley bank on september  which management has decided not to renew at this time 
the interest expense was primarily related to the bank charges for having the revolving line of credit until september  though no amounts had been withdrawn from the credit line during fiscal years and the interest income increased to approximately million in fiscal from  during fiscal interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs for fiscal was approximately  as compared to  for fiscal the decrease in interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs during fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted from paying off our long term debt during fiscal using a portion of the net proceeds from our may public offering 
income taxes our worldwide effective tax rate was and  respectively for fiscal and the effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate of  due to our ability to utilize loss carryforwards and other credits  limited by alternative minimum tax provisions  write off of non tax deductible acquisition related charges  and the movement in the valuation allowance 
on a cash basis  our tax rate was and  respectively for fiscal and see also note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the components of current and deferred income tax provision 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and the known facts and circumstances that we believe are relevant 

table of contents actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are critical  either because they relate to financial line items that are key indicators of our financial performance eg  revenue or because their application requires significant management judgment  are described in the following paragraphs 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or customer acceptance  where applicable  has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales to end user customers  or to distributors that do not receive price concessions and do not have return rights  is recognized upon shipment and transfer of risk of loss  if we believe collection is reasonably assured and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and the customer s creditworthiness 
if we determine that collection of a receivable is not probable  we defer recognition of revenue until the collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
reserves for sales returns and allowances from end user customers are estimated based on historical experience and management judgment  and are provided for at the time of shipment 
the sufficiency of the reserves for sales return and allowances is assessed at the end of each reporting period 
revenue from sales of our standard products to distributors whose terms provide for price concessions or for product return rights is recognized when the distributor sells the product to an end customer 
for our end of life products  if we believe that collection is probable  we recognize revenue upon shipment to the distributor  because our contractual arrangements provide for no right of return or price concessions for those products 
when we sell products to distributors  we defer our gross selling price of the product shipped and its related cost and reflect such net amounts on our balance sheet as a current liability entitled deferred margin on shipments to distributors 
inventory our inventory policy is described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
forecasting customer demand is the factor in our inventory policy that involves significant judgments and estimates 
we estimate excess and obsolete inventory based on a comparison of the quantity and cost of inventory on hand to management s forecast of customer demand for the next twelve months 
in forecasting customer demand  we make estimates as to  among other things  the timing of sales  the mix of products sold to customers  the timing of design wins and related volume purchases by new and existing customers  and the timing of existing customers transition to new products 
we also use historical trends as a factor in forecasting customer demand  especially that from our distributors 
we review our excess and obsolete inventory on a quarterly basis considering the known facts 
once inventory is written down  it is valued as such until it is sold or otherwise disposed of 
to the extent that our forecast of customer demand materially differs from actual demand  our cost of sales and gross margin could be impacted 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset 
the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value of the assets and their estimated fair value 
early in fiscal  we acquired arques and we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill as an asset  which we need to examine for impairment at least annually 
we have accounted for goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from our arques acquisition in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually and more frequently if there are indicators of impairment 
an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset 
the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value of the assets and their estimated fair value 
our last annual impairment analysis of arques goodwill  which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  indicated that the estimated fair value exceeded its corresponding carrying amount 
our entity is deemed as a single operating unit for our impairment analysis 
we computed fair value of our company to be equal to the market capitalization and compared it to the carrying value of the net assets of the company including goodwill and other intangible assets 

table of contents the market capitalization is based on the quoted closing market price of our stock as traded on nasdaq as of the date of our impairment analysis 
as such  we determined that no impairment exists 
the process for evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
should actual results differ from our estimates  revisions to the recorded amount of goodwill could be required 
we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might lead to impairment nor the impact such events might have on these reported asset values 
we plan to examine significant goodwill we recorded from our acquisition of arques  for impairment at least annually 
stock based compensation on april   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  fas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of fas r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a graded vesting schedule over the requisite service period of the award 
we estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a black scholes model 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the value of each employee stock option was estimated on the date of grant for the purpose of the pro forma financial information in accordance with fas the determination of fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the use of a black scholes model requires the use of extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and a number of complex assumptions including expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for year ended march  is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
fas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on an average of historical forfeitures 
the expense that we recognize in future periods could differ significantly from the current period and or our forecasts due to adjustments in assumed forfeiture rates or change in our assumptions 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires significant judgments in making certain estimates for determining tax liabilities and recoverability of certain deferred tax assets  including the tax effects attributable to net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expenses 
we must evaluate our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  in full or in part  based on all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years  and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in the event that actual results differ from the above estimates or that these estimates are adjusted in future periods  we may need to adjust the amount of the valuation allowance 
a decrease in the valuation allowance through a partial or full release is recorded as an income tax benefit or a reduction of income tax expense or a credit to shareholders equity whereas an increase in the valuation allowance is recorded as an income tax expense 
see also note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
litigation we are a party to lawsuits  claims  investigations  and proceedings  including commercial and employment matters  which are being handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
we review the current status of any pending or threatened proceedings with our outside counsel on a regular basis and  considering all the known relevant facts and circumstances  we recognize any loss that we consider probable and estimable as of the balance sheet date 
for these purposes  we consider settlement offers we may make to be indicative of such a loss under certain circumstances 
as of march   we accrued  for our litigation cases 
as of march   there were no accruals for settlement offers 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations through a combination of debt and equity financing and cash generated from operations 
as highlighted in the consolidated statement of cash flows  the company s liquidity and available capital resources are impacted by following key components i cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  ii operating activities  iii investing activities  and iv financing activities

our cash and cash equivalents decreased million and short term investments increased by million as of march  as compared to the last year which primarily reflects our moving of assets from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments 
despite our cash outflows for our acquisition of arques and investment in packaging equipment consigned to spel of approximately million and million  respectively  during fiscal  our net cash position including short term investments remained at a level consistent with the last year 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities consists of net income adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
in fiscal and fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was million and million respectively 
during fiscal  the operating activities provided million of cash despite net loss of million during the year due to the impact of non cash charges such as stock based compensation of approximately million  in process research and development expense of million from arques acquisition and depreciation and amortization of million followed by a decrease in accounts receivables of million partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities of million and decrease in deferred margin on shipments to distributors of million 
in fiscal  operating activities provided million of cash due primarily to net income of million  an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities of  and non cash charges that included depreciation and amortization of million and an decrease to inventory of million  which were reduced by an increase in accounts receivable of million and a release in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of million 
accounts receivable decreased to million at march  compared to million a year earlier  primarily as a result of our collection efforts and impact of lower shipments during the last quarter of fiscal in addition  receivables day s sales outstanding decreased to days at march  as compared to days at march  we were able to reduce our net inventory to million as of march   compared to million as of march  annual inventory turns improved to at march  from at march  the reduction in net inventory was primarily in finished goods at our hub locations reflecting the reduced demand from one of our major customers

under this one year agreement  the bank provided a million credit line 
we granted the bank a continuing security interest in all of our assets other than our intellectual property 
the agreement prohibited our paying cash dividends 
borrowings under this agreement had interest at the current prime rate  and interest was payable monthly 
the bank had the option to withdraw the commitment if we failed to comply with the covenants  if there was a material adverse change in our business  operations or condition  if we became insolvent or if other specified events or conditions have occurred 
the agreement expired on september  on october   we entered into an amended loan agreement with silicon valley bank which extended the million credit line for one year from the original september  termination date  with terms substantially the same as the original

table of contents be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next twelve months 
should we desire to expand our level of operations more quickly  either through increased internal development or through the acquisition of product lines from other entities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing
