since april  we have been working with the consortium for technology licensing ltd 
to explore opportunities to license or sell our patents 
during the second quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal  we generated a million and million gain  respectively  from the sale of patents that related to legacy products that neomagic no longer sells 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we announced a patent licensing transaction with sony corporation where sony paid us million for a non exclusive license to all of our patents 
in the patent licensing transaction with sony  we only provided sony with a license to our patents 
we did not provide sony with any intellectual know how or other confidential information that could help sony develop products that could be competitive with neomagic s products 
as of april   we were in discussions with multiple companies that we believe have infringed on our embedded dram patents 
the objective of our patent licensing business is to enter into patent licensing agreements with companies that have infringed or are expected to infringe on our patents 
in addition  we may decide to license or sell certain additional patents in the future 
licensing revenue was million in fiscal representing of our total revenue 
there was no licensing revenue in fiscal and fiscal 
table of contents our fiscal year ends on the last sunday in january 
fiscal consisted of weeks and ended on january  fiscal consisted of weeks and ended on january  fiscal consisted of weeks and ended on january  critical accounting policies and estimates neomagic s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to intangible assets and long lived assets  revenue recognition  inventories and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the amount and timing of revenue and expenses and the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
fair value of equity instruments the valuation of certain items  including valuation of warrants and compensation expense related to stock options granted  involves significant estimates with underlying assumptions judgmentally determined 
the valuation of warrants and stock options are based upon a black scholes valuation model  which requires estimates of stock volatility and other assumptions 
even if the estimates are accurate  the model may not provide the true fair value 
long lived assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  and whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decline in the market value of the assets  significant reductions in projected future cash flows or gross margins  or macroeconomic factors  including a prolonged economic downturn 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we will be required to write down such assets based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon the weighted average cost of capital 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including gross profit margins  long term forecasts of the amount and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down or write off long lived assets 
we continue to periodically evaluate our long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas and acknowledge it is possible that such evaluation might result in future adjustments for impairment 
such an impairment might adversely affect our operating results 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from two principal sources product sales and license fees for patents 

table of contents we recognize revenue from non distributor product sales when the products are shipped to the customer  title has transferred  and no obligations remain 
in addition  we require the following criteria to be met before recognizing revenue i execution of a written customer order  ii shipment of the product  iii fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility of the proceeds is probable 
our shipment terms are fob shipping point 
for products shipped to distributors  we defer recognition of product revenue until the distributors sell our products to their customers 
on occasion  however  we may sell products with end of life status to our distributors under special arrangements without any price protection or return privileges  for which we recognize revenue upon transfer of title  typically upon shipment 
at the end of each accounting period  we determine certain factors  including sales returns and allowances  that could affect the amount of revenue recorded for the period 
sales returns provisions include considerations for known but unprocessed sales returns and estimates for unknown returns based on our historical experiences 
we recognize non refundable fees for licensing our patents in the period when all of the following conditions are met i we enter into a licensing agreement with a licensee that has been executed by both parties  ii delivery has occurred and we have no further obligations regarding the licensing agreement  iii the fee is fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility of the proceeds is probable 
inventory valuation our inventory valuation policy stipulates that at the end of each reporting period we write down or write off our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory 
the amount of the write down or write off is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value of the inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs or write offs may be required 
additionally  as we introduce product enhancements and new products  demand for our existing products in inventory may decrease  requiring additional inventory write downs 
deferred taxes and tax accruals we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
based on the uncertainty of future pre tax income  we have fully reserved our deferred tax assets 
if we determine that we would be able to realize some or all of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period when such determination was made 
we have also provided accruals for certain tax liabilities based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  or less than currently assessed  the resulting reversal of such accruals would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period when the accruals are no longer deemed necessary 
conversely  if our estimate of tax liabilities is more than the amount ultimately assessed  further charges would result 
results of operations product revenue product revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in product revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to decreased shipments of our mimagic and mimagic applications processors  partially offset by increased shipments of our mimagic applications processor 
the large decrease in product revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to decreased shipments of our mimagic applications processor 
we expect that the percentage of our net sales represented by any one product or type of product may change significantly from period to period when new products are introduced and existing products reach the end of their product life cycles 

table of contents sales to customers located outside the united states including sales to the foreign operations of customers with headquarters in the united states  and foreign manufacturers that sell to united states based oems accounted for  and of product revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect that export sales will continue to represent a significant portion of product revenue 
all sales transactions were denominated in united states dollars

represents less than of product revenue customer is a distributor licensing revenue on september   we granted sony corporation of tokyo  japan a worldwide  non exclusive license to all of our patents 
in accordance with the agreement  we received revenue of million 
among the patents that were licensed to sony corporation are those that relate to the use of embedded dynamic random access memory dram technology and on chip memories in semiconductor integrated circuits 
revenue from sony accounted for of our license revenue and of our total revenue in fiscal there was no licensing revenue in fiscal and fiscal during the negotiations that led to the agreement with sony  neomagic was represented by the consortium for technology licensing  ltd  of nissequogue  new york the consortium 
neomagic and the consortium continue to explore other opportunities to generate additional revenue from neomagic s patents 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in doing so 
gross profit loss gross profit loss was thousand  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
cost of revenue includes stock based compensation of  in fiscal and amortization of deferred compensation of  in fiscal there was no amortization of deferred compensation in fiscal decrease in gross profit from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to the absence of any licensing 
table of contents revenue in fiscal and the higher margins attributable to license revenue 
fiscal gross profit was favorably impacted by the sale of  of inventory previously written off  partially offset by charges to write off excess inventory in of  gross profit for fiscal reflects licensing revenue of million partially offset by the cost of licensing revenue of million  which includes legal and other expenses and a commission payment to the consortium of approximately million 
gross profit on license revenues was of license revenue in fiscal overall gross profit for fiscal was unfavorably impacted by charges of million to write off excess inventory primarily for our mimagic applications processor and favorably impacted by the sale of million of inventory previously written off 
the negative margins in fiscal were largely due to the write off of excess mimagic inventory of approximately million 
in addition  fiscal gross loss included million of amortization of licensed intellectual property as well as a million impairment charge for licensed intellectual property 
in the future  our gross margin percentages may be affected by the mix of product revenue and licensing revenue  increased competition and related decline in unit average product selling prices particularly with respect to older generation products  changes in the mix of products sold  timing of volume shipments of new products  the availability and cost of products from our suppliers  inventory write offs  and manufacturing yields particularly on new products 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include compensation and associated costs relating to research and development personnel  amortization of intangible assets and prototyping costs  which are comprised of photomask costs and pre production wafer costs 
research and development expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these expenses include stock based compensation of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we have made  and intend to continue to make  significant investments in research and development to remain competitive by developing new and enhanced products to serve our identified markets 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal of million is primarily related to increased stock based compensation costs of million as a result of the adoption of sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  the increase in fiscal is due to increased mask costs of million  increased labor costs of million and increased patent related expenses of million 
the decrease in fiscal from fiscal of million is primarily related to lower labor costs of million due to lower headcount  decreased amortization of intellectual property of million  decreased mask costs of million  lower software license and maintenance costs of million  and lower allocated costs of million primarily related to reduced headcount 
sales  general and administrative expenses sales  general and administrative expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
these expenses include stock based compensation of million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
sales  general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal primarily due to decreased labor costs of million due to reduced headcount  decreased professional service costs of million  decreased audit and tax costs of million and decreased cost of boards used to demonstrate neomagic products of million partially offset by increased stock based compensation costs of million as a result of the adoption of sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal sales  general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal primarily due to decreased labor costs of million resulting from reduced headcount and lower financial auditing costs partially offset by increased professional service costs of million 
gain on sale of patents in the second quarter of fiscal  neomagic completed the sale of four of our patents to samsung electronics co 
ltd 
for net proceeds of approximately million after payment of expenses related to the negotiation of the patent purchase agreement 
the company has no ongoing obligations under the patent sale agreement 

table of contents in the first quarter of fiscal  neomagic completed the sale of selected patents to faust communications  llc  a private company  for net proceeds of approximately million after payment of expenses of approximately million 
the company has no ongoing obligations associated with the sale of these patents 
there were no patent sales in fiscal the patents sold in the second quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal relate to products no longer sold by neomagic and not to products that neomagic currently sells or plans to sell 
neomagic retains a worldwide  non exclusive license under the patents sold 
the sales do not include several of neomagic s important patents covering embedded dram technology or any of the unique array processing technology used in neomagic s mimagic and neomobiletv products 
during the patent sales negotiations  neomagic was represented by the consortium  a company whose ceo served on the board of neomagic until december on march   neomagic entered into an amended and restated patent licensing agreement with the consortium governing the relationship between the two parties 
impairment of certain acquired and licensed intangible assets in accordance with sfas  we assess the recoverability of our long lived assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  and whenever there are indicators of impairment 
we compare projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with those assets against their respective carrying amounts to determine whether impairment exists 
impairment  if any  is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
during fiscal  we determined that certain licensed intellectual property was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million  of which million was charged to cost of sales 
the impairment was caused by a decline in the related sales forecasts of products associated with the licensed intellectual property 
stock compensation stock compensation expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
stock compensation expense recorded in cost of revenues  research and development expenses and sales  general and administrative expenses for fiscal is the amortization of the fair value of share based payments made to employees  members of our board of directors and other service providers in the form of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan  as we adopted the provision of sfas no 
r on the first day of fiscal the fair value of stock options granted and rights granted to purchase our common stock under the employee stock purchase plan is recognized as expense over the employee requisite service period 
we elected to adopt the modified prospective method as provided by sfas no 
r 
accordingly  for fiscal  we accounted for stock compensation under sfas no 
r  while for fiscal and  we accounted for stock compensation under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
in fiscal and  we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of million and million  respectively  for deferred compensation recorded for the difference between the fair value of common stock at the date of grant and the option exercise price 
under sfas no 
r  however  we recorded compensation expense for all share based payments made to employees based on the fair value at the date of the grant 
therefore  stock compensation for fiscal was not comparable to the prior year periods 
interest income and other we earn interest on our cash and short term investments 
interest income and other was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal and the increase in fiscal from fiscal are primarily due to increased interest rates

the change in fair value of the warrant liability is a non cash charge determined by the difference in fair value from the december  issuance date to the year end date of january  the fair value of the warrant liability will be revalued each period with the resulting change reported in other income expense 
we calculate the fair value of the warrants outstanding using the black scholes model see note warrant liability of notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes not withstanding the pre tax loss of million in fiscal  we recorded a tax provision of thousand  which consisted of foreign income taxes  accrued interest and penalties on state and foreign tax liabilities  and an increase in tax reserves 
our effective tax benefit rate was in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal in fiscal  the tax rate differed from the statutory rate due primarily to an increase in our valuation allowance 
realization of our deferred tax assets  which have a full valuation allowance  depends on us generating sufficient taxable income in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of such realization  the management has concluded that a full valuation allowance is required as of january  the earnings from foreign operations in india are currently tax exempt pursuant to a tax holiday effective through the incentive provides for certain tax relief if certain conditions are met

we believe our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will satisfy our projected cash requirements through at least the next months 
however  we expect we will need to raise additional capital within the next months to fund future operating activities beyond the next months and are actively pursuing potential additional equity financing 
if we experience a material shortfall versus our plan for fiscal  we expect to take all appropriate actions to ensure the continuing operation of our business and to mitigate any negative impact on our cash position 
we believe we can take actions to achieve further reductions in our operating expenses  if necessary 
we also believe that we can take actions to generate cash by selling or licensing intellectual property  seeking funding from strategic partners  and seeking further equity or debt financing from financial sources 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
beyond fiscal  the adequacy of our resources will depend largely on our ability to complete additional financing and our success in achieving positive operating cash flows and profitability

we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
our accounting policies for these instruments are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions 
the criteria we use for designating an instrument as a hedge include its effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of derivative instruments to underlying transactions 
notwithstanding the measures we have adopted  due to the unpredictability and volatility of currency exchange rates and currency controls  we cannot assure you that we will not experience currency losses in the future  nor can we predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency fluctuations in the past  we purchased wafers in japanese yen and used foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options to minimize short term foreign currency fluctuation exposures related to these purchases 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we did not have any foreign currency forward contracts in fiscal  and interest rate risk and investment portfolio the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields  without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit rating standards as specified in our investment policy 
our investment policy also specifies limits on the type  concentration and maturity period of our investments 
our investment policy requires that we only invest in us dollar denominated investments 
in addition  a small portion of our cash balance is held in israel and india currencies
