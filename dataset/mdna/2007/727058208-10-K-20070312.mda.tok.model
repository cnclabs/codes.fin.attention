other income  net was million for fiscal  an increase from million in the prior year  primarily due to increased interest income we received during on our higher cash balance as a result of the completion of our initial public offering in october critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis on which we make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
because this can vary in each situation  actual results may differ from the estimates under different assumptions and conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue principally from the sale of premium subscription services  magazine subscriptions  banner and sponsorship advertisements  magazine advertisements and transactions services 
premium online subscription services are generally for a period of one month to twelve months 
premium online subscription services are generally paid for upfront by credit card  subject to cancellations by subscribers or charge backs from transaction processors 
revenue  net of estimated cancellations and charge backs  is recognized ratably over the service term 
to date  cancellations and charge backs have not been significant and have been within management s expectations 
deferred magazine subscription revenue results from advance payments for magazine subscriptions received from subscribers and is amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the subscription as issues are delivered 
we provide an estimated reserve for magazine subscription cancellations at the time such subscription revenues are recorded 
newsstand revenues are recognized based on the on sale dates of magazines and are recorded based upon estimates of sales  net of product placement costs paid to resellers 
estimated returns are recorded based upon historical experience 
in january  we began offering our customers premium online subscription services bundled with magazine subscriptions 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  we defer subscription revenue on bundled subscription service offerings based on the pro rata fair value of the individual premium online subscription services and magazine subscriptions 
to date  the duration of our banner advertising commitments has ranged from one week to one year 
sponsorship advertising contracts have terms ranging from three months to two years and also involve more integration with our services  such as the placement of buttons that provide users with direct links to the advertiser s website 
advertising revenue on both banner and sponsorship contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  provided that we have no significant obligations remaining at the end of a period and collection of the resulting receivables is reasonably assured  at the lesser of the ratio of impressions delivered over the total number of undertaken impressions or the straight line basis 
our obligations typically include undertakings to deliver a minimum number of impressions  or times that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of our online properties 
to the extent that these minimums are not met  we defer recognition of the corresponding revenue until the minimums are achieved 
magazine advertising revenues are recognized  net of related agency commissions  on the date the magazines are placed on sale at the newsstands 
revenues received for advertisements in magazines to go on sale in future months are classified as deferred advertising revenue 
transaction service revenue generated from sale of products held in inventory is recognized when the product is shipped net of estimated returns 
we also earn commissions for facilitating the sale of third party products and services which are recognized when earned based on reports provided by third party vendors or upon cash receipt if no reports are provided 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  the revenue earned for facilitating the sale of third party merchandise is reported net of cost as agent 
this revenue is reported net due to the fact that although we receive the order and collect money from buyer  we are under no obligation to make payment to the third party unless payment has been received from the buyer and risk of return is also borne by the third party 
we recognize transaction service revenue from our event marketing and travel events services which include cruises  land tours and resort vacations  together with revenues from onboard and other activities and all associated direct costs of our event marketing and travel events services  upon the completion of events with durations of ten nights or less and on a pro rata basis for events in excess of ten nights 
advertising costs 
costs related to advertising and promotion are charged to sales and marketing expense as incurred except for direct response advertising costs which are amortized over the expected life of the subscription  typically a twelve month period 
direct response advertising costs consist primarily of production costs associated with direct mail promotion of magazine subscriptions 
as of december  and  the balance of unamortized direct response advertising costs was  and  respectively  and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
total advertising costs in  and were   and  respectively 
valuation allowances 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to 
table of contents deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
as of december  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  respectively 
we accrue an estimated amount for sales returns and allowances in the same period that the related revenue is recorded based on historical information  adjusted for current economic trends 
to the extent actual returns and allowances vary from the estimated experience  revisions to the allowance may be required 
significant management judgments and estimates are made and used in connection with establishing the sales and allowances reserve in any accounting period 
as of december  and  the provision for sales returns and allowances included in accounts receivable  net was  and  respectively 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance of million as of december  against our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties related to our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets primarily from our net operating losses 
in the future  if we generate sufficient taxable income and we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would impact the results of operations in that period 
goodwill and other long lived assets 
our long lived assets include goodwill  intangibles  property and equipment 
we are required to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment in determining the fair value of the enterprise 
we complete our annual test as of december and any impairment losses recorded in the future could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our test for our fiscal year showed no impairment 
we are required to record an impairment charge on intangibles or long lived assets to be held and used when we determine that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that we determine to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
our estimates of cash flow require significant judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and are subject to many factors 
capitalized website development costs 
we capitalize the costs of enhancing and developing features for our websites when we believe that the capitalization criteria for these activities have been met and amortize these costs on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life  generally three years 
for  and we capitalized million  million and million  respectively 
we expense the cost of enhancing and developing features for our websites in cost of revenue only when we believe that capitalization criteria have not been met 
we exercise judgment in determining when to begin capitalizing costs and the period over which we amortize the capitalized costs 
if different judgments were made  it would have an impact on our results of operations 
stock based compensation 
we have granted stock options to employees and non employee directors 
we recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments granted after december  and prior to but not yet vested as of december   in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment fas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of fas r  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award normally the vesting period 
prior to fas r adoption  we accounted for stock based payments under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
in anticipation of the impact of adopting fas r  we accelerated the vesting of approximately  shares subject to outstanding stock options in december the primary purpose of the acceleration of vesting was to minimize the amount of compensation expense recognized in relation to the options in future periods following the adoption by us of fas r 
since we accelerated these shares and adopted fas r using the modified prospective method  we did not record any one time charges relating to the transition to fas r and the consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include any impact of fas r 
as a result of fas r  we expect to award restricted stock and restricted stock units or other compensation in lieu of or in addition to stock options 

table of contents as of december   there was approximately   of total unrecognized compensation related to unvested stock based compensation arrangements granted under our equity incentive plans 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of four years 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based payment awards and stock price volatility 
we use the black scholes model to value our stock option awards 
management uses an estimate of future volatility for our stock based on our historical volatility and the volatilities of comparable companies 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and management uses different assumptions  stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate  stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what has been recorded in the current period 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation

operating leases 
we lease or sublease office space and equipment under cancelable and noncancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through december  operating lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non cancelable operating leases for office facilities  as well as limited computer and office equipment that we utilize under lease arrangements 
the amounts presented are consistent with 
table of contents contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly  unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to exit an office facility early or expand our occupied space 
deposit commitments 
we enter into leasing agreements with cruise lines and other travel providers which establish varying deposit commitments as part of the lease agreement prior to the commencement of the lease voyage or vacation 
notes payable 
in november  we issued a note payable in connection with our acquisition of the assets of lpi in the amount of  secured by the assets of specpub  inc and payable in three equal installments of  in may  august and november the note bears interest at a rate of per year  payable quarterly and in arrears 
in june  we entered into a software maintenance agreement under which  was financed with a vendor

other 
other contractual obligations consist of a guaranteed executive incentive bonus and a purchase obligation for a co location facility agreement with a third party service provider 
under the co location facility agreement  we pay a minimum monthly fee of  to the third party service provider for providing space for our network servers and committed levels of telecommunications bandwidth 
in the event that bandwidth exceeds an allowed variance from committed levels  we pay for additional bandwidth at a set monthly rate 
future total minimum payments under the co location facility agreement are  for seasonality and inflation we anticipate that our business may be affected by the seasonality of certain revenue lines 
for example  print and online advertising buys are usually higher approaching year end and lower at the beginning of a new year than at other points during the year  and sales on our e commerce websites are affected by the holiday season and by the timing of the release of compilations of new seasons of popular television series and feature films 
inflation has not had a significant effect on our revenue or expenses historically and we do not expect it to be a significant factor in the short term 
however  inflation may affect our business in the medium term to long term 
in particular  our operating expenses may be affected by a tightening of the job market  resulting in increased pressure for salary adjustments for existing employees and higher cost of replacement for employees that are terminated or resign 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab  which addresses how uncorrected errors in previous years should be considered when quantifying errors in current year financial statements 
sab requires registrants to consider the effect of all carry over and reversing effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying errors in current year financial statements 
sab allows registrants to record the effects of adopting the guidance as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings 
we adopted sab during the fourth quarter of the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
fas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
fas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  earlier adoption is permitted  provided the company has not yet issued financial statements  including for interim periods  for that fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the impact of fas  but do not expect the 
table of contents adoption of fas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement fin which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin is a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
if an income tax position exceeds a more likely than not greater than probability of success upon tax audit  the company will recognize an income tax benefit in its financial statements 
additionally  companies are required to accrue interest and related penalties  if applicable  on all tax exposures consistent with jurisdictional tax laws 
this interpretation is effective on january  and we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio primarily in money market funds 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and have no foreign exchange contracts 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  trade accounts receivable  accounts payable and long term obligations 
we consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
investment securities with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short term investments 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investments and short term obligations  thus  fluctuations in interest rates may have a material impact on the fair value of these securities 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not materially increase decrease our earnings or loss 
our operations have been conducted primarily in united states currency and as such have not been subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk 
however  the growth in our international operations is increasing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations as well as other risks typical of international operations  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
we translate income statement amounts that are denominated in foreign currency into us dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in increased net revenue  operating expenses and net income 
conversely  our net revenue  operating expenses and net income will decrease when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations for was not material
