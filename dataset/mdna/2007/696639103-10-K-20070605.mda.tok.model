table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are one of the nation s leading manufacturers and marketers of factory built homes 
we market nationwide through vertically integrated operations  encompassing manufactured and modular housing  chattel financing and insurance 
as of march   we operated manufacturing facilities that sell homes through company owned retail superstores and builder locations and approximately independent retail dealers  builders and developers 
through our owned subsidiary  countryplace  we offer chattel and non conforming land home loans to purchasers of factory built homes sold by company owned retail superstores and certain independent retail dealers  builders and developers 
the loans originated through countryplace are held for our own investment portfolio and ultimately securitized 
we also provide property and casualty insurance for owners of manufactured homes through our wholly owned subsidiary  standard casualty 
difficult market conditions have plagued our traditional manufactured housing business since mid when the industry entered a cyclical downturn as the result of the tightening of credit standards  limited retail and wholesale financing availability  increased levels of repossessions  excessive retail inventory levels and manufacturing capacities 
industry shipments of manufactured homes were approximately  in calendar year and have decreased over the last eight years to a year industry low of  in calendar year during this eight year period  our manufactured housing shipments declined 
prior to  the increases in manufactured housing shipments to florida  arizona and california were the main factor in maintaining industry shipments at approximately  per year 
in  however  the dynamics fueling increased manufactured housing demand in these states changed quickly 
site built homes in these states experienced rapid price appreciation driven by high land cost 
as such  the increase in speculative building resulted in excess inventory 
this has caused prices to fall and buyers and sellers are postponing their home buying decisions 
it has also greatly reduced the number of over age buyers of manufactured housing since they typically must sell their site built home to buy a manufactured home 
in the last six months of calendar  shipments to florida  arizona and california were down approximately 
with the manufactured housing industry not showing signs of a quick recovery  we continue to focus on growth opportunities in our modular housing business 
we entered the modular home business in june when we acquired nationwide custom homes nationwide 
we have since added modular production to eight of our manufactured housing facilities 
industry shipments of modular homes were approximately  in calendar year  an decrease over calendar year however  our modular home sales increased in fiscal with our net sales for modular products up approximately and now accounting for approximately of our recurring net sales 
during fiscal  we decreased the number of manufacturing facilities from to and the number of company owned retail superstores from to we closed one manufacturing facility in the first quarter of fiscal that was previously idled but had been reopened for fema production in fiscal we closed two less than efficient manufacturing facilities and company owned retail superstores in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal as part of our planned strategy to more effectively balance our manufacturing and distribution capacity with the current needs of the market 
one manufacturing facility was destroyed by fire in the third quarter of fiscal we continued to execute our plan of expanding our consumer financing capabilities through countryplace 
on march   through our subsidiary countryplace  we successfully completed our second securitization for approximately million of loans including approximately million of loans to be originated in the future which were funded by issuing bonds totaling approximately million 
our initial securitization for approximately million of loans was funded by issuing bonds totaling approximately million on july  the assets are chattel loans originated by company owned retail locations with the collateral being primarily palm harbor manufactured homes built in company owned factories 
see liquidity and capital resources for further details on these transactions 

table of contents during the second quarter of fiscal  we filed a petition for the dissolution of our partnership with bsm financial lp  a conventional real estate mortgage bank of which we were the sole limited partner  and we wrote off our investment in bsm of million 
effective may   we have reached an agreement with bsm to terminate the partnership 
as part of the agreement  both parties have agreed to mutual releases of all prior claims  counterclaims and causes of action

fiscal years and were comprised of weeks while fiscal year was comprised of weeks 
as a result  there was an approximately decrease in each of the categories discussed below in the compared to section of our results of operations and an approximately increase in each of the categories discussed below in the compared to section of our results of operations 
as this change impacted all the income statement categories in a reasonably consistent manner  no separate discussion of this factor is included in this section  unless the impact of the applicable category varied from the increase described above 

table of contents compared to net sales 
net sales decreased to million in fiscal from in fiscal this million decrease in net sales is comprised of a million decrease in factory built housing net sales offset by a million increase in financial services net sales 
the decrease in factory built housing net sales is the result of million  or homes  sold to fema in fiscal and a decrease in the number of factory built homes sold excluding fema business offset by an increase in the average selling prices of new manufactured and modular homes 
the decrease in total factory built homes excluding fema business is largely due to a decrease in demand for hud code homes in florida  california and arizona  which are typically some of our most profitable states see executive overview section above for more details 
the average retail selling price of a new manufactured home increased and a new modular home increased while the average wholesale selling price of a new manufactured home increased and a new modular home increased 
these increases in average selling prices are the result of customers purchasing larger  more complex homes 
the increase in financial services net sales of million reflects an increase in interest income resulting from an increase in consumer loans receivable  net from million as of march  to million as of march  gross profit 
in fiscal  gross profit decreased to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales 
gross profit for the factory built housing segment decreased from of net sales in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease is partially due to million in charges related to closing under performing sales centers and less than efficient plants in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal excluding these charges  gross profit for the factory built housing segment would have been 
the reduction in retail and wholesale deliveries in florida  california and arizona also contributed to the decrease in factory built housing gross profit 
gross profit for the financial services segment increased million to of net sales in fiscal  up slightly from of net sales in fiscal this increase is due to the increase in net sales as explained above 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to for fiscal from for fiscal in dollars  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal of this million decrease  million related to the factory built housing segment and was offset by increases in general corporate expenses of million and increases in financial services expenses of million 
factory built housing expenses also include million in charges related to closing under performing sales centers and less than efficient plants in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal excluding these charges  selling  general and administrative expenses for the factory built housing segment decreased million 
this decrease is primarily due to a reduction in performance based compensation costs  a reduction of manufacturing facilities and sales centers at march  as compared to march  as well as our ongoing cost savings efforts 
the increase in general corporate expenses is due primarily to increases in advertising costs and various other administrative expenses 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this was primarily due to a million increase in interest expense on the warehouse revolving debt  a million increase in interest expense on the securitized financing and a million increase in interest expense on floorplan payable 
both the interest rates on the warehouse revolving debt and the floorplan payable are variable 
impairment of limited partnership and equity in earnings loss of limited partnership 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we filed a petition for dissolution of our partnership with bsm 
the investment in bsm of million as of september was written off effective september  effective may   we have reached an agreement with bsm to terminate the partnership 
as part of the agreement  we have both agreed to mutual releases of all prior claims  counterclaims and causes of action 
we have not recorded any equity in bsm s earnings losses since the second quarter when we wrote off our investment 

table of contents interest income and other 
interest income and other remained relatively flat at million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal interest income and other decreased primarily due to million earned on a real estate investment in fiscal and was offset by a million increase in interest and dividend income and a million gain on the sale of available for sale investments in fiscal income tax benefit expense 
income tax benefit is million in fiscal as compared to expense of million in fiscal this is the result of a pretax loss of million in fiscal versus pretax earnings of million in fiscal the effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal compared to net sales 
net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net sales for the factory built housing segment increased million due to selling homes to fema and million due to a increase in new factory built homes sold excluding the homes sold to fema  a shift in product mix to modular homes of total factory built net sales  excluding the million of net sales to fema  in fiscal as compared to in fiscal and an increase in the average selling price of new manufactured and modular homes 
the increase in homes sold stemmed from increased market share and the increase in average selling prices resulted from customers purchasing larger  more complex homes as well as the pass through of higher raw material costs 
the average retail selling price of a new modular home increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  the average wholesale selling price of a new modular home increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and the average wholesale selling price of a new manufactured home increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal 
financial services net sales increased million reflecting an increase in interest income at countryplace resulting from an increase in consumer loans receivable from million at the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal gross profit 
in fiscal  gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to  or million  from  or million  in fiscal gross profit for the factory built housing segment increased million from of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal this improvement reflects a strengthening of gross margin at our retail superstores  reduced availability of repossessed homes at discounted prices and increased sales prices due to customers purchasing larger  more complex homes and our ability to pass through higher raw material costs 
in addition  gross margin for fiscal was reduced million due to our closing of our least productive sales centers and streamlining our retail operations 
we were able to increase gross margin despite a decline in the internalization rate from in fiscal to in fiscal gross profit for the financial services segment increased million due to the increase in net sales as explained above 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased million for general corporate purposes  million for factory built housing and million for financial services 
the increase in general corporate expenses is due primarily to increases in incentive based compensation as we return to profitability and the increase in factory built housing expenses is due primarily to costs associated with our site construction operations  costs related to hiring it consultants as we make system enhancements and an increase in incentive based compensation as we return to profitability offset by a reduction in expenses resulting from operating fewer company owned retail superstores in fiscal as compared to fiscal average number of open stores was in fiscal compared to in fiscal 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to a million increase in fiscal of interest 
table of contents expense incurred on the securitized loans offset by a million decrease in interest expense incurred on the warehouse revolving debt 
the warehouse revolving debt interest decreased due to a significant decline in the warehouse revolving debt balance after million of borrowings were repaid with proceeds from the securitization 
equity in earnings loss of limited partnership 
equity in earnings loss of limited partnership increased to million of earnings in fiscal as compared to a million loss in fiscal this increase is primarily due to our share of bsm earnings increasing due to total originations of  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal interest income and other 
interest income and other increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal primarily due to a million increase in interest and dividend income earned on larger cash and cash equivalents and available for sale investment balances as well as higher interest rates  offset by a million decrease in income earned on a real estate investment 
income tax benefit expense 
income tax expense increased to million in fiscal as compared to a benefit of million in fiscal this increase is the result of pretax earnings of million in fiscal versus a pretax loss of million in fiscal the effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to a credit of in fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents totaled million at march   down from million at march  net cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase is primarily the result of a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  million increase in net consumer loans originated for investment  million in restricted cash relating to the securitized financings and customers deposits held in trust accounts  offset by a million decrease in inventories and a million decrease in trade receivables 
net cash used in investing activities decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal of this million decrease  million is due to increased sales of investments offset by a million increase in purchases of investments and a million increase in purchases of property  plant and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal of this million increase  million is due to less payments on warehouse revolving debt in fiscal as compared to fiscal offset by million less in proceeds on the securitized financing in fiscal as compared to the securitized financing in fiscal we have an agreement with a financial institution for a million floor plan facility expiring march  the advance rate for the facility is of manufacturer s invoice 
this facility is used to finance a portion of the new home inventory at our retail superstores and is secured by new home inventory and a portion of receivables from financial institutions 
the interest rate on the facility is prime at march  plus or prime plus to for aged units  of which we have none as of march  the floor plan facility contains certain provisions requiring us to maintain minimum amounts of liquidity  profitability  inventory turns  tangible net worth and annual operating cash flows in order to borrow against the facility 
as of march   we were not in compliance with the profitability  tangible net worth and annual operating cash flow covenants 
we obtained a waiver from the financial institution for the fiscal year ended march  we have negotiated new covenants  which will be effective beginning with the first quarter of fiscal  and we expect to be in compliance with these covenants during the next fiscal year 
in the event we are not in compliance with any of our floor plan facility covenants in future periods  we would seek a waiver of any default from the lending institution and  if no such waiver was obtained  maturities of outstanding debt could be accelerated 
we had million and million outstanding under these floor plan credit facilities at march  and march   respectively 

table of contents on may   we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes in a private  unregistered offering 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually in may and november 
on june   the initial purchaser of the notes exercised its option to purchase an additional million aggregate principal amount of the notes 
on september   for the benefit of the note holders  the company filed a shelf registration statement covering resales of the notes and the shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of the notes 
the notes are senior  unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future unsecured and senior indebtedness 
each  in principal amount of the notes is convertible  at the option of the holder  at a conversion price of  or shares of our common stock upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and contingencies 
for fiscal years  and  the effect of converting the senior notes to  shares of common stock was anti dilutive  and was  therefore  not considered in determining diluted earnings per share 
on july   we  through our owned subsidiary countryplace  completed our initial securitization for approximately million of loans  which was funded by issuing bonds totaling approximately million 
the bonds were issued in four different classes class a totaling million with a coupon rate of  class a totaling million with a coupon rate of  class a totaling million with a coupon rate of  and class a totaling million with a coupon rate of 
maturity of the bonds is at varying dates beginning in through and were issued with a weighted average maturity of years 
the proceeds from the securitization were used to repay approximately million of borrowings on our warehouse revolving debt with the remaining proceeds being used for general corporate purposes  including future origination of new loans 
for accounting purposes  this transaction was structured as a securitized borrowing 
on march   we  through our owned subsidiary countryplace  completed our second securitization for approximately million of loans including approximately million of pre funded loans to be originated in the future which was funded by issuing bonds totaling approximately million 
the bonds were issued in four classes class a totaling million with a coupon rate of  class a totaling million with a coupon rate of  class a totaling million with a coupon rate of  and class a totaling million with a coupon rate of 
maturity of the bonds is at varying dates beginning in through and were issued with a weighted average maturity of years 
the proceeds from the securitization were used to repay approximately million of borrowings on our warehouse revolving debt with the remaining proceeds being used for general corporate purposes  including future origination of new loans 
for accounting purposes  this transaction was also structured as a securitized borrowing 
countryplace has an agreement with a financial institution for a warehouse borrowing facility to fund loans originated by countryplace 
the facility is collateralized by specific consumer loans receivable pledged to the facility 
in connection with the renewal of the facility on march   the maximum borrowing amount was increased from million to million 
the facility terminates march   however  amounts outstanding under the facility are effectively settled and re borrowed on a monthly basis 
the advance against the outstanding principle balance of eligible consumer loan receivables is and draws can be made at an advance rate against land home loans in various stages of completion 
the interest rate remains libor plus 
countryplace had outstanding borrowings under the warehouse facility of million as of march  and million as of march  the facility contains certain requirements relating to the performance and composition of the consumer loans receivable pledged to the facility and financial covenants regarding maintenance of a certain loan delinquency ratio and a minimum capitalization for countryplace  which is customary in the industry 
as of march   countryplace was in compliance with these requirements 
as countryplace continues to expand and draw down on its warehouse facility  we will fund the difference between the amounts advanced under the warehouse borrowing facility and the balance of any additional loan originations 
for countryplace to increase its borrowings under the facility to the maximum million  countryplace would have to originate an additional million of new loans  of which million would have to be funded through our operations 

table of contents upon completion of the securitization  countryplace extinguished its interest rate swap agreement on its variable rate debt which was used to hedge against an increase in variable interest rates 
the agreement previously fixed the interest rate on million of countryplace s variable rate  long term warehouse revolving debt to per annum 
countryplace recorded the hedge instrument at fair value as of the end of each fiscal quarter with the effective offsetting portion of the hedge being recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  and the ineffective portion  if any  of the hedge being recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
upon extinguishment of the hedge  countryplace recorded a loss of million  net of tax  for the change in fair value to other comprehensive income loss  which will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the loans 
there was no significant ineffectiveness 
countryplace currently intends to originate and hold loans for investment on a long term basis 
countryplace makes loans to borrowers that it believes are credit worthy based on its credit guidelines 
however  originating and holding loans for investment subjects countryplace to more credit and interest rate risk than the previous business practice of originating loans for resale 
the ability of customers to repay their loans may be affected by a number of factors and if customers do not repay their loans  the profitability and cash flow of the loan portfolio would be adversely affected and we may incur additional loan losses 
countryplace intends to securitize its loan portfolio on a routine basis 
while we believe it will be able to obtain additional liquidity through the securitization of such loans  no assurances can be made that countryplace will successfully complete securitization transactions on acceptable terms and conditions  if at all 
we believe that the proceeds from the securitization  floor plan financing  borrowings on the warehouse facility and any other available borrowing alternatives will be adequate to support our working capital needs  currently planned capital expenditure needs and expansion of countryplace for the foreseeable future 
however  because future cash flows and the availability of financing will depend on a number of factors  including prevailing economic and financial conditions  business  the market for asset backed securitizations  and other factors beyond our control  no assurances can be given in this regard 
loan portfolio prior to the third quarter of  countryplace originated loans and immediately sold them to other lenders 
during the third quarter of  we executed our planned strategy and expanded countryplace into a full service chattel lender with originating  servicing and securitization capabilities 
in the first quarter of fiscal  countryplace completed its initial securitization for million of loans 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  countryplace completed its second securitization for million of loans including approximately million of pre funded loans to be originated in the future 
as a result of the expansion  our loan portfolio has grown at an annual rate of  and in fiscal  and  respectively  reflecting the build up of our lending operations 
all loan contracts are fixed rate  simple interest contracts and have monthly scheduled payments of principal and interest 
the scheduled payments for each simple interest contract would  if made on their respective due dates  result in a full or nearly full amortization of the contract 
the loan contracts have the following maturities as of march  in thousands due in less than one year due after one year through five years due after five years total the due after five years category includes million of foreclosed assets held for sale  which are included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets at a fair market value of million 

table of contents non performing loan contracts include non accrual loan contracts and foreclosed assets held for resale 
loan contracts are placed in non accrual status when countryplace determines that foreclosure is imminent as a result of a clear indication that the borrower has the inability or unwillingness to meet payments as they become due 
as of march  and march   countryplace had non performing loans totaling million and million  respectively 
as of march  and march   countryplace also had million and million  respectively  of accruing loans past due days or more 
the and non performing loans include million and million of foreclosed assets held for sale  which are included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets at a fair market value of million and million  respectively 
countryplace occasionally restructures troubled loan contracts by deferring or waiving all or part of interest  principal  tax escrow  insurance premium  fees  or other amounts owed to them by their customers 
countryplace s policies and guidelines  as well as certain contractual obligations in their securitization transaction  limit the number and the frequency of deferments and waivers that may be granted 
a loan contract for which delinquent payments are deferred is classified as current at the time the deferment is granted and therefore is not included as a delinquent account 
loan contracts subject to a payment deferral  as a percentage of the number outstanding loan contracts  were as follows march  march  number of outstanding loan contracts percentage of loans with payments deferred during fiscal year outstanding loan contracts include and foreclosed assets held for sale as of march  and march   respectively 
the deferrals in fiscal year are a direct result of hurricanes katrina and rita 
the loan contracts are principally secured by factory built homes that are geographically concentrated in texas 
approximately and of the principal balance of the loan contracts receivable as of march  and march   respectively  were secured by collateral located in texas 
if texas experiences weaker economic conditions  greater rates of decline in manufactured home values  greater rates of decline in real estate values  or more natural disasters than the united states generally experiences  then the loan contracts may experience higher rates of delinquencies  default and foreclosure losses than manufactured homes that are more geographically dispersed 
the risks created by these concentrations have been considered by management in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover estimated losses on loans at each balance sheet date 
no other states had concentrations in excess of of the loan contracts receivable balance as of march  or march  
table of contents contractual obligations dollars in thousands the following tables summarize our contractual obligations  including interest  at march  for additional information related to these obligations  see the notes to consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years floor plan payable debt obligations warehouse revolving debt convertible senior notes securitized financing securitized financing repurchase obligations letters of credit operating lease obligations total contractual obligations interest is calculated by applying contractual interest rates to march  balances 
we have contingent repurchase obligations outstanding at march  which have a finite life but are replaced as we continue to sell our factory built homes to dealers under repurchase agreements with financial institutions 
our losses related to these contingent repurchase obligations were   and  during fiscal   and  respectively 
for additional information on our repurchase obligations  see critical accounting policies reserve for repurchase obligations 
we have provided letters of credit to providers of certain of our insurance policies 
while the current letters of credit have a finite life  they are subject to renewal at different amounts based on the requirements of the insurance carriers 
we have recorded insurance expense based on anticipated losses related to these policies as is customary in the industry 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
impairment of intangible assets goodwill and other long lived assets 
in assessing the recoverability of our intangible assets and other long lived assets on an annual basis  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
recovery of deferred tax asset 
we believe it is more likely than not we will recover all of our net deferred tax assets 
recovery of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income  which we currently believe will come from future profitable operating results and available tax planning 
table of contents strategies 
should we operate unprofitably  or otherwise change our estimate of future profitable operations  we may need to record a valuation allowance on all or a part of our deferred tax assets 
net deferred tax assets at march  and march  are million and million  respectively 
revenue recognition 
retail sales of manufactured homes and certain single story modular homes  including shipping charges  are recognized when a down payment is received  the customer enters into a legally binding sales contract  title has transferred and the home is accepted by the customer  delivered and permanently located at the customer s site 
additionally  for retail sales of all multi story modular homes  nationwide modular homes  and manufactured homes in which we serve as the general contractor with respect to virtually all aspects of the sale and construction process  sales are not recognized until after final consumer closing 
transportation costs  unless borne by the retail customer or independent retailer  are included in the cost of sales 
warranties 
we provide the retail homebuyer a one year limited warranty covering defects in material or workmanship in home structure  plumbing and electrical systems 
we record a liability for estimated future warranty costs relating to homes sold  based upon our assessment of historical experience factors 
factors we use in the estimation of the warranty liability include historical warranty experience related to the actual number of calls and the average cost per call 
although we maintain reserves for such claims based on our assessments as described above  which to date have been adequate  there can be no assurance that warranty expense levels will remain at current levels or that such reserves will continue to be adequate 
a large number of warranty claims exceeding our current warranty expense levels could have a material effect on our results of operations and liquidity 
reserve for repurchase obligations 
factory built housing companies enter into repurchase agreements with financial institutions which have provided wholesale floor plan financing to independent dealers  builders and developers 
these agreements generally provide that in the event of an independent dealer  builder or developer s default we will repurchase the financed home from the lending institution at declining prices over the term of the repurchase agreement generally months 
the risk of loss under such repurchase agreements is mitigated by the fact that i approximately of our homes are sold through our company owned stores for which no repurchase agreement exists  ii a majority of the homes we sell to independent dealers  builders and developers are pre sold to specific retail customers  iii we monitor each dealer s  builder s and developer s inventory position on a regular basis  iv sales of our manufactured homes are spread over a large number of dealers  builders and developers  v none of our independent dealers  builders and developers accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal  vi the price we are obligated to pay declines over time and vii we are  in most cases  able to resell homes repurchased from credit sources in the ordinary course of business without incurring significant losses 
transfers of financial assets 
countryplace has completed two securitizations of manufactured housing loan receivables since the second quarter of fiscal the securitizations were accounted for as financings  which use the portfolio method of accounting in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases  where loan contracts are securitized and accounted for as borrowings  interest income is recorded over the life of the loans using the interest method  the loan contracts receivable and the securitization debt asset backed certificates remain on countryplace s balance sheet  and the related interest margin is reflected in the income statement 
this accounting has been utilized since july   the date of issue of the company s initial securitized financing 
the securitizations include provisions for removal of accounts by countryplace that preclude sale accounting of the securitizations under sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
the structure of countryplace s securitizations have no effect on the ultimate amount of profit and cash flow recognized over the life of the loan contracts  except to the extent of surety fees and premiums  trustee fees  backup servicer fees  and securitization issuance costs 
however  the structure does affect the timing of cash receipts 

table of contents countryplace services the loan contracts under pooling and servicing agreements with the securitization trusts 
countryplace also retains interests in subordinate classes of securitization bonds that provide over collateralization credit enhancement to senior certificate holders and are subject to risk of loss of interest payments and principal 
as is common in securitizations  countryplace is also liable for customary representations 
we guarantee certain aspects of countryplace s performance as the servicer under the securitization pooling and servicing agreement 
allowance for loan losses 
countryplace originates and holds for investment purposes loans related primarily to the retail sale of our factory built homes  with such loans being collateralized primarily by the factory built home 
countryplace provides allowances for estimated future loan losses at the time of sale and during the term of the loan 
the allowance for loan losses gives consideration to the composition of the loan portfolio  including historical loss experience by static pool  expected probable losses based on industry knowledge of losses for a given range of borrower credit scores  the composition of the portfolio by credit score and seasoning  and recent loss experience 
the allowance reflects countryplace s judgment of the probable loss exposure at the end of the reporting period 
although countryplace maintains an allowance for loan losses based upon these expectations and other criteria  future differences between countryplace s expectations with respect to loan losses and actual losses incurred in the portfolio could differ  and require countryplace to provide additional allowances 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transaction  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas r permits entities to use any option pricing model that meets the fair value objective in the statement 
we adopted sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on various related matters such as derecognition  interest  penalties and disclosure 
fin is effective with our fiscal year beginning march  we expect that the financial impact  if any  of applying the provisions of fin to all tax positions will not be material upon the initial adoption of fin in the first quarter of fiscal in september  the fasb issued statement  fair value measurements fas 
this statement clarifies the definition of fair value  the methods used to measure fair value  and requires expanded financial statement disclosures about fair value measurements for assets and liabilities 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently assessing the impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt  which consists primarily of our liabilities under retail floor plan financing arrangements and warehouse revolving debt
