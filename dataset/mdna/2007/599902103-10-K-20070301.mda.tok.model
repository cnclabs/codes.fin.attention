item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations contains forward looking statements  including statements about our growth and future operating results  discovery and development of products  strategic alliances and intellectual property 
for this purpose  any statement that is not a statement of historical fact should be considered a forward looking statement 
we often use the words expect  anticipate  intend  plan  believe  may  will and similar expressions to help identify forward looking statements 
actual results may differ from those indicated by such forward looking statements as a result of various important factors  including  without limitation  those factors discussed in this annual report under the heading risk factors 
overview we are an innovation driven biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing medicines to change the lives of patients with cancer and inflammatory diseases 
we currently commercialize velcade  the us market leader for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy 
in addition  velcade is the first and only fda approved therapeutic for the treatment of patients who have received at least one prior therapy for mantle cell lymphoma  or mcl 
we have a development pipeline of nine clinical and preclinical product candidates in our therapeutic focus areas of cancer and inflammatory diseases  and we have an oncology focused drug discovery organization 
strategic business relationships are a key component of our business 
in november  we completed a sale of million of convertible senior notes due november   or the notes  which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price equal to per share  subject to adjustment  unless previously repurchased by us under certain circumstances 
under the terms of the notes  we are required to make semi annual interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of the notes on may and november of each year 
we expect to use the net proceeds from the notes primarily to acquire therapeutic agents  which may be in development or already marketed  through license arrangements or acquisitions of other companies  and any balance for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
in we refined our business strategy to focus on advancing key growth assets including velcade  our clinical and preclinical pipeline of oncology and inflammation molecules and our oncology focused discovery organization 
in  we announced a program to further align resources with our current corporate priorities of advancing velcade and accelerating the clinical pipeline 
as part of this program  we reduced in house research and preclinical development technologies and headcount in areas where we believe the work can now be outsourced cost effectively  and we also scaled back infrastructure supporting these activities 
we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million related to the program for the year ended december  we recorded total restructuring charges of approximately million under all restructuring initiatives primarily related to facilities charges for the year ended december  we expect total restructuring charges in  under all restructuring initiatives  to be within the range of million to million 
we are still evaluating the need or opportunity for further facilities consolidation associated with the restructuring initiative and the total future restructuring charges for facility consolidation are dependent upon the nature and timing of the final decisions we make 
as we continue to evaluate strategic alternatives  including potential facilities consolidation in connection with our programs  we may incur significant restructuring charges in future periods 
in october  we announced a two year agreement with ortho biotech inc  or obi  to jointly promote velcade in the us in the first quarter of  obi and we began to jointly promote velcade to us based physicians who treat multiple myeloma patients 
on september   schering plough ltd 
and schering corporation  together referred to as sgp  obtained the exclusive us development and commercialization rights for integrilin from us 
our restructured relationship with sgp has been  and we expect it to continue to be  at least financially equivalent to the former co promotion arrangement that we had with sgp prior to september   taking into account the expected future revenues and anticipated costs savings 
strategically  our goal in restructuring the relationship was to increase the near term certainty of revenues from integrilin through the guaranteed minimum royalties for and  while eliminating the need to further invest our resources into integrilin sales and marketing and development activities 
in addition  the restructured relationship allows us to focus on our key growth assets  including velcade  our product candidate pipeline and our oncology focused discovery organization 
our business strategy is to build a portfolio of new medicines based on our understanding of genomics and particular molecular pathways that affect the establishment and progression of specific diseases 
these molecular pathways include the related effects of proteins on cellular performance  reproduction and death 
we plan to develop and commercialize many of our products on our own  but expect to seek development and commercial collaborators on favorable terms or when we otherwise believe that doing so would be advantageous to us 
in the near term  we expect to focus our commercial activities in cancer where we plan to build on our commercial and regulatory experience with velcade 
we also are working to obtain approval to market velcade in the united states and  through ortho biotech products  lp  or obl  elsewhere for the treatment of multiple myeloma in newly diagnosed  or front line patients  and for the treatment of additional cancer types 
we believe  if approved  these additional uses of velcade would lead to a significant expansion of our cancer business 
in inflammatory disease  we are advancing novel product candidates in clinical development as potential treatments for serious and widely prevalent conditions 
in the long term  we expect to bring new products to market on a regular basis from our pipeline of discovery and development stage programs 
we also expect to continue to evaluate opportunities to in license and acquire molecules from other companies in order to supplement our pipeline 
if we are successful  we will use the revenues from this expanding portfolio of marketed products to broaden the scope of our operations 
velcade velcade  the first of a new class of medicines called proteasome inhibitors  was the first treatment in more than a decade to be approved in the united states for patients with multiple myeloma 
we received accelerated approval based on phase ii data from the fda on may  to market velcade for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have received at least two prior therapies and have demonstrated disease progression on their most recent therapy  commonly referred to as third line and beyond 
in december  the fda granted full approval of velcade for the treatment of patients with mcl who have received at least one prior therapy  commonly referred to as relapsed  or second line mcl 
this approval followed the fda s decision in november to grant velcade fast track designation for mcl due to the high unmet medical need of mcl patients and the strength of clinical trial data for velcade in the treatment of mcl 
in april  we initiated a phase iii trial of velcade in combination with rituximab in the relapsed follicular and marginal zone non hodgkin s lymphoma setting 
in march  we received full approval from the fda of our supplemental new drug application  or snda  for velcade for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy  commonly referred to as second line or relapsed multiple myeloma 
this regulatory decision increases the approved market potential of the drug and also marked the completion of the confirmatory studies required by the fda after it granted accelerated approval in may velcade is the only single agent therapy that has both demonstrated longer survival in patients with multiple myeloma and the extension of patient survival on its fda approved labeling 
in april  the european commission granted marketing authorization for velcade in europe for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have received at least two prior therapies and have demonstrated disease progression on their most recent therapy 
under this authorization  the european commission granted us a single license for marketing velcade in the member states of the european union  plus norway and iceland 
velcade was also approved for marketing in the ten accession member countries when those countries officially joined the european union on may  regulatory authorities in a number of other countries  including countries within latin america and south east asia and japan have also approved velcade 
the product is now approved in more than countries 
under our agreement with obl  we have transferred the licenses to affiliates of obl 
obl s affiliates now market velcade in these countries 
in april  obl received approval from the european commission for velcade as a monotherapy for multiple myeloma patients who have received at least one prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for bone marrow transplantation 
in october  obl received approval for marketing velcade in japan for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in patients who have received at least one prior therapy 
our alliances velcade ortho biotech collaborations in october  we announced a two year agreement with ortho biotech inc  or obi  to jointly promote velcade in the us in the first quarter of  obi and we began to jointly promote velcade to us based physicians who treat multiple myeloma patients 
we will pay the cost of a portion of the obi sales effort dedicated to velcade and a commission if sales associated with the increased effort exceed specified targets 
both parties are able to terminate the agreement under certain circumstances and subject to termination fees 
we will continue to be responsible for manufacturing and distribution of velcade in the us we believe this collaboration  with the well established obi oncology sales force  will help us to realize the full potential of velcade in the us market 
our current agreement with obl  a member of the johnson family of companies and an affiliate of obi  for the promotion of velcade outside the us remains unchanged 
in june  we entered into an agreement with obl to collaborate on the commercialization of velcade and with johnson johnson pharmaceutical research development  llc  or jjprd  for the continued clinical development of velcade 
obl and its affiliate  janssen cilag  are commercializing velcade outside of the united states  and janssen pharmaceutical kk is responsible for japan 
we receive distribution fees included in royalties from obl and its affiliates from sales of velcade outside of the united states 
we manage the supply chain for velcade at the expense of obl for products sold in the obl territories 
we retain an option to co promote velcade with obl at a future date in specified european countries 
we are engaged with jjprd in an extensive global program for further clinical development of velcade with the purpose of maximizing the commercial potential of velcade 
this program is investigating the potential of velcade to treat multiple forms of solid and hematological tumors  including continued clinical development of velcade for multiple myeloma and non hodgkin s lymphoma  or nhl 
jjprd was responsible for of the joint development costs through and is now responsible for of those costs 
we are eligible to receive payments from jjprd or obl for achieving clinical development milestones  regulatory milestones outside of the united states or agreed upon sales levels of velcade 
integrilin through august   we co promoted integrilin in the united states in collaboration with sgp and shared profits and losses 
as of september   sgp markets integrilin in the united states and specified other areas outside of the european union 
glaxosmithkline plc  or gsk  markets integrilin in the european union under a license from us 
sgp collaboration in april  cor entered into a collaboration agreement with sgp to jointly develop and commercialize integrilin on a worldwide basis 
we acquired cor in february under our original collaboration agreement with sgp  we generally shared any profits or losses from integrilin sales in the united states included in co promotion revenue with sgp and we granted sgp an exclusive license to market integrilin outside the united states and the european union in exchange for royalty obligations 
on september   sgp obtained the exclusive us development and commercialization rights for integrilin products from us and paid us a nonrefundable upfront payment of approximately million 
in addition  we are entitled to receive royalties on net product sales of integrilin in the united states from sgp for so long as sgp is engaged in the commercialization and sale of an integrilin product in the united states  with the potential of receiving royalties beyond the patent expiration date 
minimum royalty payments for are set at approximately million 
there are no guaranteed minimum royalty payments beyond we also receive royalties on net product sales by sgp outside of the united states 
sgp s obligation to pay us royalties in other countries expires on a country by country basis upon the later of fifteen years from the first commercial use of an integrilin product in such country and the expiration of the last to expire patent covering such integrilin product 
we are continuing to manage the supply chain for integrilin at the expense of sgp for products sold in the sgp territories including the us we receive payments as a result of managing the supply chain and record those payments as strategic alliance revenue 
gsk license agreement in june  we reacquired the rights to market integrilin in europe from sgp and concurrently entered into a license agreement granting gsk exclusive marketing rights to integrilin in europe 
in january  the transition of the integrilin marketing authorizations for the european union from sgp to gsk was completed  and gsk began selling integrilin in the countries of the european union 
gsk also markets integrilin in other european countries where it has received approval of the transfer from sgp to gsk of the relevant marketing authorizations 
under the terms of the agreement  we have received license fees and are entitled to future royalties from gsk on integrilin sales in europe subject to the achievement of specified objectives 
we manage the supply chain for integrilin at the expense of gsk for products sold in the gsk territories 
we receive payments as a result of managing the supply chain and record those payments as strategic alliance revenue 
sanofi aventis inflammatory disease collaboration in june  we entered into a broad agreement in the field of inflammatory disease with aventis  now sanofi aventis  which includes joint discovery  development and commercialization of small molecule drugs for the treatment of specified inflammatory diseases 
this agreement covers a substantial portion of our development program in the inflammatory disease area and provides us with potential access to sanofi aventis large promotional infrastructure in connection with the commercialization of jointly developed products 
the discovery phase of this collaboration has concluded 
however  we and sanofi aventis are continuing a limited research program covering two advanced preclinical candidates discovered through the collaboration 
the development and commercialization programs continue under the agreement 
as provided in the original agreement  in north america  we have agreed to share the responsibility for and cost of developing  manufacturing and marketing products arising from the alliance 
outside of north america  sanofi aventis is responsible for and will bear the cost of developing  manufacturing and marketing products arising from the alliance 
sanofi aventis is required to pay us a royalty on product sales outside of north america 
under this agreement  sanofi aventis acquired million shares of our common stock over a two year period through for million 
to date  we and sanofi aventis have identified a significant number of novel drug targets and associated molecules relevant in inflammatory diseases 
during the remaining portion of the development phase of the alliance  we and sanofi aventis have agreed to focus our joint resources on preclinical and clinical development of candidates identified in the collaboration 
as of the end of  the alliance had identified several development candidates  one of which  mln  is now being tested in a phase ii clinical trial and two of which  mln and mln  are now being tested by us in phase i clinical trials 
a fourth candidate  mln  is now in preclinical testing 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory  intangible assets  goodwill  restructuring and stock based compensation expense 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we believe the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue we recognize revenue from the sale of our products  our strategic alliances and royalties and distribution fees based on net sales of licensed products 
we recognized revenue from our co promotion collaboration through august  we divide our revenue arrangements with multiple elements into separate units of accounting if specified criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
we allocate the consideration we receive among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and we apply the applicable revenue recognition criteria to each of the separate units 
we classify advance payments received in excess of amounts earned as deferred revenue until earned 
we recognize revenue from the sale of velcade in the united states when delivery has occurred and title has transferred 
during the fourth quarter of  we began distributing velcade through a sole source open access distribution model in which we sell directly to an independent third party who in turn distributes to the wholesaler base 
in april  our sole source distributor added a second distribution site to its network in order to improve access to the product for physicians in the western united states 
under our agreement with our sole source distributor  inventory levels are contractually limited to no more than three weeks 
velcade product inventory levels held by the sole source distributor and wholesalers may fluctuate from time to time within our desired range of one to two weeks of inventory in the distribution channel 
for example  during the second quarter of  inventory levels rose by less than a week to the higher end of our one to two week desired range 
we record allowances as a reduction to product sales for product returns  chargebacks and discounts at the time of sale 
we estimate velcade product returns based on historical return patterns 
we expect velcade returns to be  and returns have been  generally low because the shelf life for the product is months in the united states  and we expect  and have experienced  that wholesalers will not stock significant inventory due to the relatively high cost of the product 
we consider several factors in our estimation process  including our internal sales forecasts  inventory levels as provided by wholesalers and third party market research data 
as we continually monitor actual product returns and inventory levels in the domestic distribution channel  we have reduced and may  from time to time in the future  reduce our product returns estimate 
doing so results in increased product sales at the time the return estimate is changed 
if circumstances change or conditions become more competitive in the market for therapeutic products that address multiple myeloma  we may take actions to increase our product return estimates 
doing so would result in an incremental reduction of product sales at the time the return estimate is changed 
our accruals for rebates  chargebacks  and other discounts were immaterial at december  through august   we recognized co promotion revenue based on sgp s reported shipments of integrilin to wholesalers 
co promotion revenue included our share of the profits from the sales of integrilin and reimbursements of our manufacturing related costs  development costs and advertising and promotional expenses 
we communicated with sgp to calculate our share of the profits from the sales of integrilin on a monthly basis 
the calculation included estimates of the amount of advertising and promotional expenses and other costs incurred on a monthly basis 
adjustments to our estimates were based upon actual information that we received subsequent to our reporting deadlines 
our estimates were adjusted on a monthly basis and historically the adjustments were not significant due to frequent communication with sgp 
we recognize nonrefundable upfront licensing fees and guaranteed  time based payments that  in either case  require continuing involvement in the form of research and development  manufacturing or other commercialization efforts by us as strategic alliance revenue ratably over the development period if development risk is significant  ratably over the manufacturing period or estimated product useful life if development risk has been substantially eliminated  or based upon the level of research services performed during the period of the research contract 
when the period of deferral cannot be specifically identified from the contract  management estimates the period based upon other critical factors contained within the contract 
we continually review these estimates  which could result in a change in the deferral period and might impact the timing and the amount of revenue recognized 
milestone payments are recognized as strategic alliance revenue when the substantive performance obligations  as defined in the contract  are achieved 
performance obligations typically consist of significant milestones in the development life cycle of the related product candidate  such as initiation of clinical trials  filing for approval with regulatory agencies and approvals by regulatory agencies 
reimbursements of research and development costs are recognized as strategic alliance revenue as the related costs are incurred 
we are entitled to receive royalty payments under license agreements with a number of third parties that sell products based on technology we have developed or to which we have rights 
these license agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on sales of the licensed product and we record royalty revenues based on estimates of sales from interim data provided by licensees 
beginning september   upon closing the amended collaboration agreement with sgp  we began recording royalty revenues as a separate line item in our statement of operations 
for all of our royalty arrangements  we perform an analysis of historical royalties we have been paid  adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are adjusted for in the period which they become known  typically the following quarter 
these adjustments have not been  and we do not expect them to be  significant 
to the extent we do not have sufficient ability to accurately estimate royalty revenue  we record royalties on a cash basis 
inventory inventory consists of currently marketed products 
velcade inventories primarily represent raw materials used in production  work in process and finished goods inventory on hand  valued at cost 
integrilin inventories include raw materials used in production and work in process  valued at cost  to supply gsk and limited amounts of work in process  valued at cost  to supply sgp 
we review inventories periodically for slow moving or obsolete status based on sales activity  both projected and historical 
our current sales projections provide for full utilization of the inventory balance 
if product sales levels differ from projections or a launch of a new product is delayed  inventory may not be fully utilized and could be subject to impairment  at which point we would adjust inventory to its net realizable value 
intangible assets we have acquired significant intangible assets that we value and record 
those assets that do not yet have regulatory approval and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed as acquired in process research and development  and those that are specifically identified and have alternative future uses are capitalized 
we use a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets at acquisition 
the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash inflows and outflows  risk  the cost of capital  and terminal values 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
we engage independent valuation experts who review our critical assumptions for significant acquisitions of intangibles 
we review intangible assets for impairment on a periodic basis using an undiscounted net cash flows approach when impairment indicators arise 
if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset  we would write down the intangible asset to the discounted cash flow value 
where we cannot identify cash flows for an individual asset  our review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable 
goodwill on october   we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and determined that no impairment existed on that date 
however  since the date of acquisition of cor  which generated a significant amount of goodwill  we have experienced a significant decline in market capitalization due to a decline in stock price 
we continually monitor business and market conditions  including the restructured relationship with sgp  to assess whether an impairment indicator exists 
if we were to determine that an impairment indicator exists  we would be required to perform an impairment test  which could result in a material impairment charge to our statement of operations 
restructuring in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  our facilities related expenses and liabilities under all of our restructuring plans included estimates of the remaining rental obligations  net of estimated sublease income  for facilities we no longer occupy 
we validated our estimates and assumptions with independent third parties having relevant expertise in the real estate market 
we review our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis until the outcome is finalized  and make whatever modifications we believe necessary  based on our best judgment  to reflect any changed circumstances 
it is possible that such estimates could change in the future resulting in additional adjustments  and the effect of any such adjustments could be material 
stock based compensation expense we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  effective january  under the modified prospective method 
sfas r requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation expense in our operations  and accordingly the adoption of sfas r fair value method has had and will continue to have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including stock price volatility and expected term of an option 
in determining our volatility  we have considered implied volatilities of currently traded options to provide an estimate of volatility based upon current trading activity in addition to our historical volatility 
after considering other such factors as our stage of development  the length of time we have been public and the impact of having a marketed product  we believe a blended volatility rate based upon the most recent three year and four year periods of historical performance  as well as the implied volatilities of currently traded options  best reflects the expected volatility of our stock going forward 
changes in market price directly affect volatility and could cause stock based compensation expense to vary significantly in future reporting periods 
we use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior  adjusted for known trends  to arrive at the estimated expected life of an option 
we update these assumptions on a quarterly basis to reflect recent historical data 
additionally  we are required to estimate forfeiture rates to approximate the number of shares that will vest in a period to which the fair value is applied 
we will continually monitor employee exercise behavior and may further adjust the estimated term and forfeiture rates in future periods 
increasing the estimated life would result in an increase in the fair value to be recognized over the requisite service period  generally the vesting period 
estimated forfeitures will be adjusted to actual forfeitures upon the vest date of the cancelled options as a cumulative catch up adjustment on a quarterly basis 
doing so could cause future expenses to vary at each reporting period 
in march  we revised our annual merit compensation program to include the availability of both stock options and restricted stock to certain employees 
for the year ended december   we recognized total stock based compensation expense under sfas r of million 
as of december   the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock option awards amounted to approximately million  including estimated forfeitures  which will be amortized over the weighted average remaining requisite service periods of approximately one and one half years 
as of december   the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock awards amounted to approximately million  including estimated forfeitures  which will be amortized over the weighted average remaining requisite service periods of approximately one and three quarter years 
during the second quarter of  we received a telephone inquiry from the securities ad exchange commission  or sec  regarding whether stock options we awarded with a stated grant date of september  were  in fact  granted on that date 
we were one of more than companies discussed in a may third party report concerning the timing of stock option grants from through with respect to us  the report referenced option grants dated september  during the second quarter of  we initiated a review of our september  grants  as well as other historical grants 
we completed this review during the third quarter of and met with the sec to discuss our findings 
we reported to the sec that our review did not uncover any evidence of fraud with respect to the september  options grants or the other historical option grants that we reviewed 
additionally  we reported to the sec our conclusion that any additional compensation expense resulting from the grants we reviewed was immaterial 
the sec staff advised us at our meeting that they would communicate with us after they had evaluated the results of our review and the documentation we provided 
accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas no 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
codifies the definition of fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date  clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not currently believe that adoption will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  although we have not completed our evaluation of the interpretation  we do not currently believe that adoption will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
reclassifications we have reclassified certain prior year amounts within the consolidated statements of cash flows to conform to the current year presentation related to equity adjustments from foreign currency translation 
we have reclassified certain prior year amounts included in accrued expenses of the consolidated balance sheets to accounts payable to conform to the current year presentation related to uninvoiced receipts in the normal course of business 
this reclassification has no impact on previously reported net loss or current liabilities in any period presented

no stock based compensation expense was recognized under sfas r in any prior period 
stock based compensation expense is allocated in the consolidated statements of operations expense lines as follows year ended december  research and development selling  general and administrative revenues total revenues decreased to million in compared to and increased in to million from million in the decrease in was primarily related to lower revenue received from our collaborators  which consists of revenue under strategic alliances  royalties  and in  co promotion revenue 
the decrease in revenue received from our collaborations was primarily the result of the restructured relationship with sgp  including a one time sale of existing integrilin inventory to sgp during the third quarter of additionally  we recognized lower license fees from gsk in this decrease was offset in part by increased distribution fees recognized from obl on sales of velcade outside of the united states 
the increase in was primarily due to the net effect of the restructured sgp collaboration relationship and increased net product sales of velcade 
net product sales of velcade increased to million in and to million in from million in the increase in was primarily due to price increases of the product and our ability to maintain the product s market leadership in the relapsed multiple myeloma treatment setting despite new competition in the increase in was primarily due to growth in the second line treatment setting as a result of the march fda market approval of our snda filing 
reserves for product returns  chargebacks and discounts represented approximately to of gross product sales in and net product sales from velcade represented approximately of our total revenues  of our total revenues and of our total revenues 
total revenues related to velcade  including net product sales of the product by us in the us and revenues from obl included in strategic alliance revenue and royalties more fully described below  were approximately million in  million in and million in as of september   we are no longer reporting co promotion revenue due to our restructured relationship with sgp 
co promotion revenue from integrilin represented approximately of our total revenues and of our total revenues 
in  the first full year of our modified relationship with sgp  total revenues related to integrilin were approximately million  including million in royalties we received from sgp for sales of integrilin in the united states 
in and  total revenues related to integrilin  including co promotion revenue and revenues from sgp and gsk included in strategic alliance revenues and royalties more fully described below  were approximately million and million  respectively 
revenue under strategic alliances decreased to million in and increased to million in from million in the decrease in was primarily due to the one time sale of existing integrilin inventory to sgp in  as well as lower license fees recognized from gsk 
the increase in was primarily due to the reimbursement of manufacturing related expenses  including the september  one time sale of the existing raw materials and finished goods integrilin inventory to sgp of approximately million 
we expect revenue under strategic alliances to fluctuate in future periods depending on the level of revenues earned for ongoing development efforts  the timing of milestones achieved and the number of alliances we may enter into in the future with major biopharmaceutical companies 
beginning september   in connection with the closing of our transaction with sgp  we now record royalty revenue 
royalty revenue may include royalties earned upon sales of integrilin in the united states and other territories around the world as provided by sgp  royalties earned upon sales of integrilin in europe as provided by gsk  distribution fees earned upon sales outside of the united states of velcade as provided by obl and any royalties earned under certain of our early discovery alliances 
we recorded million and million of royalty revenue in and  primarily consisting of royalties from sgp and obl 
we recognize revenues from activities outside of the us  including royalties  distribution fees  milestones from obl  sgp and gsk for sales of velcade and integrilin and for cost reimbursement of product sold to these parties 
without taking into account revenues we receive for development costs or milestones  our revenues for these activities outside of the us were million in  million in and million in cost of sales cost of sales decreased to million in and increased to million in from million in cost of sales includes manufacturing related expenses associated with the sale of velcade  as well as costs associated with managing the integrilin supply chain on behalf of sgp 
the decrease in and the increase was primarily due to the one time sale of existing integrilin inventory to sgp in on september  research and development research and development expenses decreased to million in and to million in from million in the decreases in both and were primarily a result of cost reductions associated with our strategy refinement and restructuring efforts combined with the decreased spending in our discovery organization 
research and development expenses in include stock based compensation expense of approximately million related to the adoption of sfas r on january  in addition to our ongoing clinical trials of velcade  we have a number of drug candidates in clinical and late preclinical development 
in january  as part of our portfolio review process  based on the evaluation of recent clinical data in the context of additional opportunities in the pipeline  we decided to discontinue development of mln as well as mln in rheumatoid arthritis

completion of clinical trials may take several years or more and the length of time can vary substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
the types of costs incurred during a clinical trial vary depending upon the type of product candidate and the nature of the study 
we estimate that clinical trials in our areas of focus are typically completed over the following timelines clinical phase objective estimated completion period phase i establish safety in humans  study how the drug works  metabolizes and interacts with other drugs years phase ii evaluate efficacy  optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety years phase iii confirm efficacy and safety of the product years upon successful completion of phase iii clinical trials of a product candidate  we intend to submit the results to the fda to support regulatory approval 
however  we cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will prove to be safe or effective  will receive regulatory approvals  or will be successfully commercialized 
our clinical trials might prove that our product candidates may not be effective in treating the disease or have undesirable or unintended side effects  toxicities or other characteristics that require us to cease further development of the product candidate 
the cost to take a product candidate through clinical trials is dependent upon  among other things  the disease indications  the timing  the size and dosing schedule of each clinical trial  the number of patients enrolled in each trial and the speed at which patients are enrolled and treated 
we could incur increased product development costs if we experience delays in clinical trial enrollment  delays in the evaluation of clinical trial results or delays in regulatory approvals 
some products that are likely to result from our research and development projects are based on new technologies and new therapeutic approaches that have not been extensively tested in humans 
the regulatory requirements governing these types of products may be more rigorous than for conventional products 
as a result  it is difficult to estimate the nature and length of the efforts to complete such products as we may experience a longer regulatory process in connection with any products that we develop based upon these new technologies or therapeutic approaches 
in addition  ultimate approval for commercial manufacturing and marketing of our products is dependent on the fda or applicable approval body in the country for which approval is being sought  adding further uncertainty to estimated costs and completion dates 
significant delays could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates 
due to the variability in the length of time necessary to develop a product  the uncertainties related to the estimated cost of the projects and ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available 
we budget and monitor our research and development costs by type or category  rather than by project on a comprehensive or fully allocated basis 
significant categories of costs include personnel  clinical  third party research and development services and laboratory supplies 
in addition  a significant portion of our research and development expenses is not tracked by project as it benefits multiple projects or our technology platform 
consequently  fully loaded research and development cost summaries by project are not available 
given the uncertainties related to development  we are currently unable to reliably estimate when  if ever  our product candidates will generate revenue and cash flows 
we do not expect to receive net cash inflows from any of our major research and development projects until a product candidate becomes a profitable commercial product 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in compared to and decreased eight percent to million in from million in the decrease in both and was primarily the result of reduced sales and marketing expenses associated with the transfer of the us commercialization rights for integrilin to sgp as of september  selling  general and administrative expenses in include stock based compensation expense of approximately million related to the adoption of sfas r on january  restructuring in october  we announced a program to further align resources with our current corporate priorities of advancing velcade and accelerating the clinical pipeline by lowering investment in discovery and supporting areas 
as part of our program  we are reducing in house research and development technologies and headcount in areas where the work can now be outsourced effectively  and we also scaled back infrastructure supporting these activities 
during the fourth quarter of  we announced a strategy refinement focused on advancing key growth assets  including velcade  our clinical and preclinical pipeline of oncology and inflammation molecules and our oncology focused discovery organization 
as part of our refined strategy  we took a series of steps  building on our restructured relationship with sgp  which together reduced research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses in we reduced the size of our company from approximately  employees at the end of to approximately  at the end of  by managing attrition  eliminating integrilin sales and marketing positions  and reducing the number of positions in our inflammation discovery and business support groups 
in december and june  we took steps as part of our restructuring plan to focus our resources on drug development and commercialization 
our restructuring plan included consolidation of research and development facilities  overall headcount reduction and streamlining of discovery and development projects 
during  we recorded a total of million of restructuring charges under all of our restructuring initiatives 
we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million under the restructuring program primarily related to employee termination benefits 
costs of termination benefits relate to severance packages  outplacement services and career counseling for employees affected by restructuring 
we also recorded restructuring charges in of approximately million under the restructuring plan  primarily related to the impairment charges for leasehold improvements that were abandoned at facilities  offset by a credit resulting from the earlier than anticipated sublease of one of the vacated buildings at a higher rate per square foot than we had originally estimated 
we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million in under the restructuring plan  primarily related to the lease termination payment for our vacated facility in cambridge  england 
during  we recorded a total of million of restructuring charges for our and restructuring plans 
we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million under the restructuring plan  primarily related to the remaining rental obligation  net of sublease income  of vacated facilities  the impairment charges for leasehold improvements that were abandoned at such facilities and employee termination benefits for the employees affected by the transfer of the us commercialization rights to integrilin to sgp  as well as the headcount reductions within inflammation discovery and business support groups 
we recorded approximately million of restructuring charges in under our restructuring plan 
this charge included million of additional facilities expense reflecting changes in our estimates of the length of time it would take to sublease certain vacated properties based upon our continuing review of current real estate market conditions 
we estimate that of the remaining restructuring liabilities under all restructuring initiatives at december   we will pay approximately million in and million thereafter through we expect to record additional restructuring charges in of between million to million 
these charges relate to certain facilities that we decided to abandon in november  but will not be vacated until  as well as net present value adjustments on facilities charged to restructuring in prior years 
in connection with the decision to abandon the facilities in  we revised the useful lives of the leasehold improvements at these facilities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we recorded additional amortization expense of approximately million in research and development expense related to our decision 
we are still evaluating the need or opportunity for further facilities consolidation associated with the restructuring initiative and the total future restructuring charges for facility consolidation are dependent upon the nature and timing of the final decisions we make 
as we continue to evaluate strategic alternatives  including potential facilities consolidation in connection with our programs  significant restructuring charges could occur in future periods 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangible assets of million in was relatively unchanged from of million and increased one percent from to amortization in  and primarily related to specifically identified intangible assets from the cor acquisition 
we will continue to amortize the specifically identified intangible assets from our cor acquisition through we expect to incur amortization expense of approximately million for each of the next five years 
investment income investment income increased to million in compared to and increased to million in from million in the increase in was primarily attributable to a higher average balance of invested funds combined with a million gain recognized in december upon the settlement of the class action lawsuit of worldcom  inc and an additional realized gain of approximately million in october upon the final settlement and receipt of the escrowed portion of the transform pharmaceuticals  inc  or transform  sales proceeds 
the increase in was primarily attributable to the realized gain of approximately million recognized upon the sale of our cost method investment in transform combined with the lower realized losses recognized in as compared to interest expense interest expense increased to million in from the expense of million and decreased in from the expense of million 
the increase in is primarily due to increased interest expense under our notes combined with the amortization of deferred financing costs incurred in connection with the sale of our notes 
other income we recorded other income of approximately million in upon the receipt of million in connection with the termination of the support agreement that we entered into in connection with a proposed acquisition of anormed  inc in october and the recognition of a deferred gain of million in july from the sale of assets to genelogic  inc in gain on sale of equity interest in joint venture through our acquisition of leukosite  we became a party to a joint venture partnership  millennium and ilex partners  lp  or m i  for development of campath alemtuzumab humanized monoclonal antibody 
we sold our equity interest in m i and in consideration for the sale  during the first quarter of  we recorded the final million gain related to our sale of this equity interest based upon the achievement of predetermined sales targets of campath 
we will be entitled to additional payments from ilex s successor  genzyme corporation  if sales of campath in the united states exceed specified annual thresholds 
however  we currently do not expect that these thresholds will be achieved and  therefore  we are unlikely to receive future additional payments related to campath 
liquidity and capital resources we require cash to fund our operating expenses  to make capital expenditures  acquisitions and investments and to pay debt service  including principal and interest and capital lease payments 
we have and may in the future lose money in these investments and our ability to liquidate these investments is in some cases very limited 
we may also owe our partners milestone payments and royalties 
we also have committed to fund development costs incurred by some of our collaborators 
we have funded our cash requirements primarily through the following product sales of velcade  payments from our strategic collaborators  including equity investments  license fees  milestone payments and research funding  our co promotion relationship with sgp for the sale of integrilin through august   royalty payments related to the sales of our products  and equity and debt financings in the public markets 
in the future  we expect to continue to fund our cash requirements from some or all of these sources as well as from sales of other products  subject to receiving regulatory approval 
we are entitled to additional committed research and development funding under some of our strategic alliances 
we believe the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash are revenues from sales of velcade  integrilin and other products and services for which we may obtain marketing approval in the future or which are sold by companies that may owe us royalty  milestone  distribution or other payments on account of such products  the success of our clinical and preclinical development programs  our ability to enter into additional strategic collaborations and to maintain existing collaborations as well as the success of such collaborations  and the receptivity of the capital markets to financings by biopharmaceutical companies generally and to financings by our company specifically 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
this excludes million of interest bearing marketable securities classified as restricted cash on our balance sheet as of december   which primarily serve as collateral for letters of credit securing leased facilities 
our significant capital resources and sources and uses of cash are as follows december  in thousands cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities working capital year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above cash flows the principal use of cash in operating activities in both and was to fund our net loss 
in december  we achieved a million milestone related to sales of velcade outside of the united states  which we collected in january in september  we received approximately million from sgp  consisting of the upfront license fee associated with the us commercialization rights for integrilin  as well as payment for the one time sale of existing integrilin raw materials and finished goods inventory 
in january  we paid sgp approximately million for advances sgp had made to cor for inventory purchases in prior years 
cash flows from operations can vary significantly due to various factors including changes in accounts receivable  as well as changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the average collection period of our accounts receivable can vary and is dependent on various factors  including the type of revenue and the payment terms related to those revenues 
the principal use of cash in investing activities in was to invest in marketable securities  partially offset by the receipt of approximately million in october upon the final settlement of the escrowed portion of the sale proceeds from transform 
investing activities provided cash of million in  primarily from the sales and maturities of marketable securities 
in april  we received proceeds of approximately million upon the sale of our cost method investment in transform 
financing activities provided cash of million in  primarily from the sale of our notes in november  and million in  primarily from the purchases of common stock by our employees 
we used cash of approximately million in to pay off our convertible senior notes in accordance with the payment terms 
we also used cash in financing activities to make principal payments on our capital leases in all periods presented 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and the anticipated cash payments from our product sales  current strategic alliances and royalties will be sufficient to support our expected operations  fund our debt service and capital lease obligations and fund our capital commitments for at least the next several years 
contractual obligations our major outstanding contractual obligations relate to our facilities leases  convertible notes  and capital lease financings 
as of december   our convertible notes aggregated to million in principal amount outstanding  of which million is classified as short term and mature in january and march all three issues of notes require semi annual interest payments through maturity 
all required interest payments have been made to date 
as of december   these notes consisted of million of the notes due november   million of principal of convertible subordinated notes which were due and paid on january  these notes were convertible into millennium common stock at any time prior to maturity at a price equal to per share  or the notes  and million of principal of convertible subordinated notes due march   that are convertible into millennium common stock at any time prior to maturity at a price equal to per share  or the notes 
in november  we completed a sale of the notes  which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million 
the notes bear interest at the rate of per year on the principal amount accruing from november  and payable semiannually in arrears in cash on may and november of each year  beginning may  the notes are convertible into our common stock based upon a conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of the notes  which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment 
the notes are convertible only in the following circumstances if the closing price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price within a specified period  if specified distributions to holders of our common stock are made or specified corporate transactions occur  if the average trading price per  principal amount of the notes is less than of the average conversion value of the notes within a specified period  which we refer to as the parity trigger  or during the last three months prior to maturity of the notes 
upon conversion  we have the right to deliver shares of our common stock  cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock to satisfy our conversion obligation 
the parity trigger represents an embedded derivative that requires bifurcation and separate accounting under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
at issuance and as of december   we estimated that the value of the parity trigger was not material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in january  we repaid our notes in full for approximately million in accordance with the payment terms 
below is a table which presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period in thousands total less than one year years years years and beyond long term debt obligations  including interest payments capital lease obligations  including rental and interest payments operating lease obligations long term supply contracts external collaborations total in addition to the amounts reflected in the table above  in the future we may owe royalties and other contingent payments to our collaborators  licensors and other parties based on the achievement of product sales and specified other objectives and milestones 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately billion to offset future federal taxable income  expiring in through  and billion to offset future state taxable income expiring in through we also have federal and net state tax credits of approximately million to offset federal and state income taxes  both of which expire beginning in due to the degree of uncertainty related to the ultimate use of the operating loss carryforwards and tax credits  we have fully reserved these tax benefits 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we manage our fixed income investment portfolio in accordance with our policy for securities investments  or investment policy  that has been approved by our board of directors 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs  and obtain competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
investments are made primarily in investment grade corporate bonds with effective maturities of three years or less  asset backed debt securities and us government agency debt securities 
these investments are subject to risk of default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments also are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december  however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short effective maturities of debt instruments  interest rate risk is mitigated 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio as of december  as of december   the fair value of our notes  notes and notes approximates their carrying value 
the interest rates on our convertible notes and capital lease obligations are fixed and therefore not subject to interest rate risk 
we receive distribution fees from obl based on worldwide sales of velcade outside of the us as a result  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily euro 
movement in foreign currency exchange rates could cause royalty revenue to vary significantly in future periods 
as of december   we did not have any financing arrangements that were not reflected in our balance sheet
