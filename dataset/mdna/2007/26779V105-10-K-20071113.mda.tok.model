item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our management s discussion and analysis includes forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from the statements we make in this section due to a number of factors that are discussed in item a risk factors 
during  we classified as discontinued operations our baton rouge and west houston facilities 
our operating results for all periods presented reflect these operations as discontinued 
executive summary spinoff on august   dynacq s board of directors determined that it would be in the best interests of the shareholders to separate the domestic operations of the company from its investment in the dean joint venture to design  construct  own and operate the china project 
management believes the separation of those operations into two distinct public companies will enhance the ability of the company to obtain financing for the china project  while allowing the domestic operations to continue without the financial commitments to and significant risks associated with the construction and operation of a new hospital in a foreign country 
all the assets of the company except for its investment in the china project will be transferred into a newly formed  wholly owned subsidiary corporation  ssha  and all the shares of ssha will be distributed to the current shareholders of dynacq as a dividend in the spinoff 
dynacq will continue to own the interest in the china project  will receive million from ssha over a five year term to fund its operations  and will seek additional financing to fulfill its obligations under the dean joint venture agreement and to complete the construction and operation of the china project 
the company will obtain the consent to the spinoff from the holder of a majority of its outstanding shares and intends to mail an information statement to its shareholders in november explaining the spinoff in more detail 
the spinoff and the results thereof are not discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company is not obligated to consummate the spinoff and may determine not to do so if in the judgment of management the spinoff would not be advisable and in the best interests of the company and its shareholders 
update on assets held for sale in  the company made the decision to sell the assets related to its baton rouge and west houston facilities and its land in the woodlands  texas 
during the fiscal year ended august   the company sold its west houston facility 
in may  the company signed an earnest money contract for sale of the land in the woodlands  texas  and the sale was subsequently completed in september the net proceeds and gain on sale of land in the woodlands  texas were million and  respectively 
the company entered into the sale agreement for the sale of assets related to its baton rouge facility on november   and the sale is expected to be completed in the second quarter of fiscal year  subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions 
the expected sales proceeds and gain on sale of the assets related to the baton rouge facility are million and million  respectively 
see business industry background baton rouge facility for a description of the terms of the sale agreement 
the assets related to these facilities have been classified as assets held for sale 
none of these assets is encumbered by secured lien or debt  so all proceeds from the sale of any of those assets  net of selling expenses  would be available to the company to pursue its business plans 
update on accounts receivable related to medical dispute resolutions the company  in conjunction with most of the texas hospital medical providers  continues its efforts to resolve the pending claims regarding payment for the treatment of injured workers under the texas workers compensation laws 
the company exhausts all of its available avenues in collecting its accounts receivable particularly in the workers compensation arena 
this includes the appeal to soah or the district court for workers compensation cases where the insurance carrier failed to reimburse the company in accordance with the rules of reimbursement mandated by texas state law 

table of contents the company has recently been successful in its pursuit of collections regarding the stop loss cases pending before soah  receiving positive rulings in over of its claims presented for administrative determination 
further  in a declaratory judgment action before the rd state judicial district court of travis county  texas  the interpretation of the statute as applied to the stop loss claims of the company by soah was upheld 
it is expected that the ruling of the trial court will be appealed to the state of texas third court of appeals by the insurance carriers 
claims regarding payment for hospital outpatient services remain pending at the tdwc 
it is expected that these claims will be adjudicated at soah and ultimately in the texas district and appellate courts 
bariatric program for pasadena  garland and baton rouge facilities new bariatric or weight control programs were implemented at the pasadena and baton rouge facilities in the first quarter of fiscal and at the garland facility in the second quarter of fiscal  to replace the former bariatric programs at those facilities and to reduce costs associated with outside vendor programs 
our programs provide or contract for marketing  pre authorization and follow up support services to prospective bariatric patients in areas serviced by the pasadena  garland or baton rouge facilities 
the new bariatric programs have resulted in an increase in bariatric cases at all our facilities 
each of our baton rouge and pasadena facilities was designated as a bariatric center of excellence by the american society for bariatric surgery asbs in august and june  respectively 
the asbs center of excellence designation recognizes surgical programs and surgeons who have demonstrated a track record of favorable short and long term outcomes in bariatric surgery and have the resources to perform safe bariatric surgeries 
net patient service revenues net patient service revenues increased by million  or  compared to the prior year period  to million  as net patient service revenue from our garland facility increased by million  or  partially offsetting a decline of million in net patient service revenue at the pasadena facility 
approximately  and of the company s net patient service revenue for fiscal years  and  respectively  were generated at the company s pasadena facility 
the garland facility contributed  and in net patient service revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
during fiscal years  and  approximately  and of the company s gross revenues came from surgeries covered by workers compensation  and approximately  and came from services covered by commercial and other insurance payers  respectively 
the increase in net patient service revenues is due to several reasons discussed below increase in bariatric and orthopedic cases at garland facility increase in gross patient service revenues generated by commercial and other insurance payers increase in average net patient service revenue per case increase in bariatric and orthopedic cases at garland facility the garland facility had an increase in both bariatric and orthopedic cases due to recruitment of additional physicians 
the increase in net patient service revenue is primarily due to an increase in overall number of cases and also due to a increase in number of inpatient cases at our garland facility  which typically have a higher average reimbursement per case 
this increase has been partially offset by continued decreases in bariatric and orthopedic cases at our pasadena facility of and  respectively 
in fiscal year  we added a net of physicians to the staff at the garland facility and had a net decrease of two physicians at the pasadena facility 
of the net physicians added  specialize in orthopedics and pain management  in neurological surgery and in bariatric surgery 
the other additions are hospital based physicians who do not generally make referrals to our hospitals or directly generate patient revenues 

table of contents the utilization rate of our hospitals varies widely among physicians on our medical staffs and among specializations  so an increase in the number of physicians on our medical staffs does not  in itself  result in an increase in patient referrals or revenues 
while we attempt to continue to attract and retain additional physicians  the potential loss of physicians who provide significant net patient revenues for the company may adversely affect our results of operations 
increase in gross patient service revenue generated by commercial and other insurance payers we have increased our gross patient service revenues from services covered by commercial and other insurance payers from in to in  primarily due to maturing of our bariatric program at our garland facility 
this increase is attributable to an increase in our historical cash collection rate  which in turn increased our net patient service revenues 
increase in average net patient service revenue per case even though the number of cases increased only overall in compared to  the net patient service revenue increased by 
this is primarily due to an increase in the number of inpatient cases at our garland facility and a higher cash collection percentage of of gross billed charges in compared to in marketing our marketing efforts are directed primarily at physicians and other healthcare professionals who are principally responsible for referring patients to our facilities 
we market our facilities to physicians by emphasizing the high level of patient satisfaction with our hospitals  the quality and responsiveness of our services and the practice efficiencies provided by our facilities 
we believe that providing quality facilities creates a positive environment for patients and physicians 
the company  through its subsidiaries  also has agreements with outside organizations that offer marketing  pre authorization and follow up support services to prospective orthopedic and or bariatric patients in areas serviced by the pasadena and or garland facilities 
these facilities receive orthopedic and bariatric referrals from other sources  and such organizations also refer clients to other area hospitals 
in addition to our arrangements with outside organizations regarding marketing  we implemented new bariatric or weight control programs at the pasadena facility in the first quarter  and at the garland facility in the second quarter  of fiscal  to replace the former bariatric programs at those facilities and to reduce costs associated with outside vendor programs 
our new programs provide or contract for marketing  pre authorization and follow up support services to prospective bariatric patients in areas serviced by the pasadena or garland facilities 
internal controls our outside auditors have advised that there were no identified material weaknesses in our internal controls at august  see item a 
controls and procedures 
revenue recognition through the fiscal year ended august   the company did not participate in managed care contracts 
in the quarter ended november   the company began such participation and currently participates in a small number of managed care contracts 
we recognize revenue based upon our estimate of the amount of cash which we will collect for the services delivered 
we estimate that we will collect the same percentage of our gross invoices for each facility on a case by case basis in each period as we have actually collected during the trailing months 
what we term contractual allowance is the amount which must be subtracted from gross billed charges to arrive at the net patient service revenue 
for the years ended august   and  our aggregate contractual allowance  as a percentage of gross billed revenues  was  and  respectively 

table of contents accounts receivable the focus of our business is relatively complex cases with corresponding large facility reimbursements 
our gross patient service revenue was generated from service to injured texas workers worker s compensation and from out of network commercial insurance 
the principal cases involved were orthopedic spine surgeries and bariatric surgeries for the morbidly obese  respectively 
our accounts receivable are larger and older than those of typical healthcare companies because of our pursuit of additional reimbursements through the mdr process 
historically the company has not participated in managed care contracts and has not received a substantial amount of reimbursement from medicare or medicaid 
however  during the first quarter of fiscal  the company began participation in certain managed care contracts and anticipates entering into additional contracts in the future 
so far these contracts have not resulted in any meaningful patient revenues 
following our approach to revenue recognition  we initially subtract the contractual allowance from the gross receivables 
the great bulk of our receivables are due from insurance carriers 
there has been a significant development in the mdr appellate process  as enforced under the workers compensation act  which is described in detail below 
on december   in an action before the st judicial district court of travis county  texas  section k of the texas labor code  as amended and made effective on september   was declared unconstitutional for failing to afford the parties to a medical dispute  brought pursuant to labor code section and pending before the tdwc  an opportunity for hearing 
the labor code statute was amended in  and the provisions affording the parties a hearing at soah were reinstated 
in spite of this recent development  the mdr division of the tdwc has not issued any findings and decisions in the company s pending fee disputes 
because of this extended uncertainty in the mdr process  we do not arbitrarily write off mdr receivables 
we evaluate mdr receivables to estimate the amount that should be collected 
if that estimate is less than the gross receivables net of contractual allowance and allowance for uncollectible accounts  we then write it down to the estimated collectible amount 
at each balance sheet date we also separately classify as long term receivables all receivables that we expect to collect more than one year from the balance sheet date 
the mdr system is important to an understanding of our financial statements 
the following information provides a more detailed description of the mdr process  as well as others of our critical accounting policies and estimates 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to the management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities 
management believes these accounting policies involve judgment due to the significant assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset and liability amounts 
management believes it has exercised proper judgment in determining these estimates based on the facts and circumstances available to its management at the time the estimates were made 
the significant accounting policies are described in the company s financial statements see note in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
of these policies  management believes the following ones may involve a comparatively higher degree of judgment and complexity 
we have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition background the company s revenue recognition policy is significant because net patient service revenue is a primary component of its results of operations 
revenue is recognized as services are delivered 
the determination of the amount of revenue to recognize in connection with the company s services is subject to significant judgments and estimates  which are discussed below 

table of contents revenue recognition policy through the fiscal year ended august   the company did not participate in managed care contracts 
in the quarter ended november   the company began such participation and currently participates in a small number of managed care contracts 
the company records revenue pursuant to the following policy 
the company has established billing rates for its medical services which it bills as gross revenue as services are delivered 
gross billed revenues are then reduced by the company s estimate of the discount contractual allowance to arrive at net patient service revenues 
net patient service revenues are based on historical cash collections as discussed below and may not represent amounts ultimately expected to be collected 
at such time as the company can determine that ultimate collections have exceeded or have been less than the revenue recorded on a group of accounts  additional revenue or reduction in revenue is recorded as a change in estimate during the current period 
the company does adjust current period revenue for actual differences in estimated revenue recorded in prior periods and actual cash collections 
as the company is able to identify specific closed blocks of business  the company compares the actual cash collections on gross billed charges to the estimated collections that were recorded in revenue 
the company records additional revenue or a reduction in revenue in the current period equal to the difference in the estimate recorded and the actual cash collected 
in the last three fiscal years  the company has recorded additional revenue on two specific blocks of business during the fiscal year ended august  as follows the company collected  on a block of business generated at our garland facility which was acquired in august between september and december gross billings on this block of receivables were  the contractual allowance booked on this block of receivables was  or approximately  generating net revenue of  since the company actually collected  on this block of receivables  additional revenue in the amount of  was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year the company collected  on a block of business generated at our garland facility between january and february gross billings on this block of receivables were  the contractual allowance booked on this block of receivables was  or approximately  generating net revenue of  since the company actually collected  on this block of receivables  additional revenues in the amounts of  and  were recorded in the first and second quarters of fiscal year  respectively 
the table below sets forth the percentage of our gross patient service revenue by financial class for the fiscal years  and workers compensation commercial medicare medicaid self pay other contractual allowance the company computes its contractual allowance based on the ratio of the company s historical cash collections during the trailing twelve months to gross billed revenue on a case by case basis by operating facility 
this ratio of cash collections to billed services is then applied to the gross billed services by operating facility 
the following table shows gross revenues and contractual allowances for fiscal years  and year ended august  gross billed charges contractual allowance net revenue contractual allowance percentage 
table of contents accounts receivable accounts receivable represent net receivables for services provided by the company 
the estimated accounts receivable not expected to be collected within twelve months of the balance sheet date have been shown as long term receivables and represent receivables in the medical dispute resolution mdr process and legal third party financial class ltp 
the contractual allowance is provided as revenue is recognized 
at each balance sheet date management reviews the accounts receivable for collectibility 
for each operating facility  the historical cash collection percentage based on cash collections for the last twelve months of each financial class  except mdr and ltp  is calculated by each aging bucket 
these aging bucket specific percentages are then applied to the accounts receivable at each balance sheet date for each aging bucket and financial class to estimate the amount of accounts receivable management expects to collect 
all accounts receivable over five months from date of service  except for mdr and ltp  are valued at zero in this balance sheet analysis 
accounts receivable related to mdr and ltp are estimated at collectibility in our balance sheet analysis irrespective of the age of the accounts receivable 
the company initially receives an average to of gross billed charges either upon filing the insurance claim  or after filing a request for reconsideration to the insurance company 
the company applies these payments received to the gross accounts receivable  but does not adjust the balance on the account 
the company expects to collect on an average an additional of the remaining mdr balance 
the mdr accounts receivable are written off only after all collection efforts have failed  including the appeals process of mdr which may take several years 
if after the review management believes certain receivables are uncollectible  the receivables are written down to the estimated collectible amount 
however  if the estimated amount to be collected is greater than the net accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date  no adjustment is made to accounts receivable ie no additional revenue is booked  due to the length of time it takes to ultimately settle the mdr accounts receivable and the current uncertainty associated with such settlements 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company wrote down its accounts receivable at the west houston facility by  based on the balance sheet approach 
the following table shows accounts receivable  the contractual allowance  net receivables and the contractual allowance as a percent of gross receivables at august  and current portion of gross receivables current portion of contractual allowance net current portion of accounts receivable contractual allowance as a percentage of current gross receivables long term portion of gross receivables long term portion of contractual allowance net long term portion of accounts receivable contractual allowance as a percentage of long term gross receivables the contractual allowance stated as a percentage of gross receivables at the balance sheet dates is larger than the contractual allowance percentage used to reduce gross billed charges due to the application of partial cash collections to the outstanding gross receivable balances  without any adjustment being made to the contractual allowance 
the contractual allowance amounts netted against gross receivables are not adjusted until such time as the final collections on an individual receivable are recognized 
collections for services provided are generally settled or written off as uncollectible against the contractual allowance within six months of the date of service except for services provided to injured workers in texas 
because the company has in recent years focused on providing services to injured workers in texas  accounts receivable in the workers compensation mdr process have increased 

table of contents the mdr process is an established reimbursement resolution process available to providers of healthcare services under the regulations guiding reimbursement for services provided to injured workers in the state of texas 
accounts generally do not become subject to the mdr process prior to being outstanding for at least days subsequent to patient discharge 
for medical services provided to injured workers in the state of texas  the mdr process is specifically based upon the administrative and statutory regulations promulgated by the texas labor code  the texas administrative code and the texas insurance code 
the company  in conjunction with most of the texas hospital medical providers  continues its efforts to resolve the pending claims regarding payment for the treatment of injured workers under the texas workers compensation laws 
if any reimbursement provided by a workers compensation carrier is improper pursuant to the statutory or regulatory guidelines administered by the tdwc  our facilities request and pursue additional reimbursement 
following is a brief discussion on the time line of a typical workers compensation claim bills are submitted to a carrier within days of date of service 
a carrier has days to respond to provider with payment or an explanation of benefits eob indicating the rationale of denial or defense to payment 
the company forwards a request for reconsideration rfr to a carrier after the th day of the carrier s receipt of the bill or after receipt of the eob 
the carrier has days to respond to the rfr 
should the carrier fail to respond or provide the reimbursement requested  the company files a request with the mdr division of the tdwc 
this usually occurs at or about six to eight months after the date of service due to administrative requirements before filing the initial request to tdwc 
usually to days after filing the initial request with the mdr division  tdwc will review the mdr request and determine if additional information is needed 
tdwc then will forward an mr form requesting any additional documentation and rationale for additional reimbursement 
the company has days after the date of receipt of the mr to provide additional documentation and a position statement that outlines the rationale for the request for additional reimbursement 
tdwc is not required by the texas labor code or the texas administrative code to provide a finding and decision within a specific timeframe 
based upon the historical actions of the tdwc  a finding and decision is usually received within to months after the supplemental documentation was forwarded to tdwc 
however  a final timetable remains unknown in spite of the travis county district court s determination of the unconstitutionality of the mdr appellate process as enforced by the workers compensation act 
after receipt of the tdwc finding and decision  the non prevailing party has the option of appealing the decision with the soah within days of receiving the finding and decision from tdwc 
a hearing date with soah is assigned generally within days  however  this time period is usually extended to months depending on discovery requests 
soah will issue a decision to days after the contested case hearing or after final closing briefs have been filed 
the soah decision may be appealed to the district court within days of soah s issuance of its decision and order 
the company has a significant number of reimbursement disputes in which the mdr decision was unsatisfactory to either the insurance carrier or us  and these decisions have subsequently been appealed to soah or 
table of contents the district court 
many of these cases involve the stop loss rule governing reimbursement to providers 
the company has recently been successful in its pursuit of collections regarding the stop loss cases pending before soah receiving positive rulings in over of its claims presented for administrative determination 
further  in a declaratory judgment action before the rd state judicial district court of travis county  texas  the interpretation of the statute as applied to the stop loss claims of the company by soah was upheld 
it is expected that the ruling of the trial court will be appealed to the state of texas third court of appeals by the insurance carriers 
claims regarding payment for hospital outpatient services remain pending at the tdwc 
it is expected that these claims will be adjudicated at soah and ultimately in the texas district and appellate courts 
the delays caused by the unexpected and extended abatements of the soah proceedings for both the inpatient and outpatient cases have added significantly to the age of our accounts receivable for these types of services 
if these disputes are ultimately resolved against the company s positions  it may have a material adverse effect on the financial statements 
due to a number of factors outside the company s control  including changes in the company s reimbursement collection experience associated with potential changes in the reimbursement environment in which the company operates  it is possible that management s estimates of patient service revenues could change  which could have a material impact on the company s revenue and profitability in the future 
sources of revenue and reimbursement the focal point of our business is providing patient care services  including complex orthopedic and bariatric procedures 
the company pursues optimal reimbursement from third party payers for these services 
we do not normally participate in managed care or other contractual reimbursement agreements  principally because they limit reimbursement for the medical services provided 
this business model often results in increased amounts of reimbursement for the same or similar procedure  as compared to other healthcare providers 
however  there are no contractual or administrative requirements for prompt payment of claims by third party payers within a specified time frame 
as a result  the company has tended to receive higher amounts of per procedure reimbursement than that which may be received by other healthcare providers performing similar services 
conversely  despite the increased reimbursement  we may take additional time to collect the expected reimbursement from third party payers 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company began participation in certain managed care contracts and anticipates entering into additional contracts in the future 
so far these contracts have not resulted in any meaningful patient revenues 
increased participation in managed care contracts and programs may decrease the per procedure reimbursement that the company collects in the future for similar services 
in addition to the fact that our collection process may be longer than other healthcare providers because of our focus on workers compensation and other commercial payers  the collection process can be extended due to our efforts to obtain all optimal reimbursement available to the company 
specifically  for medical services provided to injured workers  the company may initially receive reimbursement that may not be within the fee guidelines or regulatory guidelines mandating reimbursement 
for such cases in which third party payers did not provide appropriate reimbursement pursuant to these guidelines  the company pursues further reimbursement 
the company reviews and pursues those particular claims that are determined to warrant additional reimbursement pursuant to the fee or regulatory guidelines 
the company s pursuit of additional reimbursement amounts that it believes are due under fee or regulatory guidelines may be accomplished through established dispute resolution procedures with applicable regulatory authorities 
surgeries are typically not scheduled unless they are pre authorized by the insurance carrier for medical necessity  with the exception of medicare  medicaid and self pay surgeries 
after the surgery  the company s automated computer system generates a statement of billed charges to the third party payer 
at that time  the company also requests payment from patients for any remaining amounts that are the responsibility of the patient 
in cases where a commercial insurance payers pre approval is not approved subsequently  those accounts receivable may be classified to self pay 
historically  such classifications have not been significant 

table of contents allowance for uncollectible accounts the company evaluates bad debt expenses periodically and  if needed  sets up an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
theoretically the only bad debts the company could have are emergency room treatments which are not ultimately paid 
these bad debt expenses are written off against the contractual allowance in order to streamline and standardize the charge off procedure 
as a result of its analysis of bad debt expense  management determined that it no longer needed a separate provision for bad debts and terminated that separate provision effective march  through the end of the quarter ended february   the company had estimated uncollectible accounts expense of of gross outpatient revenue 
these bad debt expenses provision for uncollectible accounts through february  have been combined with other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations  and the allowance for uncollectible accounts as of february  has been combined with the contractual allowance on the consolidated balance sheet 
income taxes sfas  accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income 
valuation allowances are established for the deferred tax assets that we believe do not meet the more likely than not criteria established by sfas no 
judgments regarding future taxable income may be revised due to changes in market conditions  tax laws  or other factors 
if our assumptions and estimates change in the future  then the valuation allowances established may be increased  resulting in increased income tax expense 
conversely  if we are ultimately able to use all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established  then the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense 
income tax expense is the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
stock based compensation effective at the beginning of our fiscal year  we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
share based payment sfas no 
r to account for stock based compensation 
under sfas no 
r  we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value for awards that are expected to vest is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the option vesting term 
the amount of expense attributed is based on an estimated forfeiture rate  which is updated as appropriate 
this option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected volatility of our common stock  pre vesting forfeiture rate and an option s expected life 
the financial statements include amounts that are based on our best estimates and judgments
