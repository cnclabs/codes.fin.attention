item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of monarch 
the discussion and analysis does not include any comments relating to monarch community bancorp since monarch community bancorp has no significant operations 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 
monarch s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on loans  investments  and overnight deposits  and interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowings 
monarch s results of operations also are significantly affected by the level of its gains from sales of mortgage loans 
critical accounting policies as described under regulation and supervision  the financial services industry is highly regulated 
other than described below  management does not believe the use of estimates and management judgment is likely to present a material risk to the financial statements 
in cases where estimates or management judgment are required  internal controls and processes are established to provide assurance that such estimates and management judgments are materially correct to the best of management s knowledge 
allowance for loan losses 
accounting for loan classifications  accrual status  and determination of the allowance for loan losses is based on generally accepted accounting principles and regulatory guidance 
this guidance includes  but is not limited to  generally accepted accounting principles  the uniform retail credit classification and account management policy issued by the federal financial institutions examination council  the joint policy statement on the allowance for loan losses methodologies issued by the federal financial institutions examination council and guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission 
accordingly  the allowance for loan losses includes a reserve calculation based on an evaluation of loans determined to be impaired  risk ratings  historical losses  loans past due  collateral values and cost of disposal and other subjective factors 
goodwill 
the original value of goodwill was determined by allocating the purchase price to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
periodically  goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
this test involves calculating the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
thus  the carrying value of goodwill is subject to a high degree of estimation and management judgment 
management strategy our strategy is to operate as an independent retail oriented financial institution dedicated to serving the needs of customers in our market area 
we are committed to providing a broad range of products and services to meet the needs of our consumer and small business customers 
as part of this commitment  we expect to continue our origination of higher credit quality residential and commercial real estate loans to borrowers in our market area and commercial real estate loans to borrowers outside our current market area 
our focus in will be growth in commercial lending and non interest income  maintaining a high level of customer service  growth of core deposits  continued improvement of credit quality  and continued development of our sales culture 
we are dedicating resources to these initiatives that management believes will lead to a higher level of profitability  shareholder value and overall success 
management believes focusing on these areas in will serve the company well into the future 
we intend to continue to capitalize on the acquisition of msb financial  inc with further expansion of our lending activities in calhoun county 
changes in financial condition from december  to december  general 
monarch s total assets increased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  increases in loans in were offset by decreases in cash  investments  foreclosed assets  premises and equipment and other assets 
loans 
monarch s net loan portfolio increased million  or  from million at december  to million at december  gross loans increased million  or  from million at december  to million at december  the increases in loan balances were due to new loan production exceeding repayments and payoffs on existing loans 
total loan originations decreased from million in to million in one to four family originations have declined as new loan production has declined along with the mortgage market 
commercial real estate  multi family  home equity  and construction land development loans increased in as lenders had more time to focus on new loan origination as a result of the success they had in improving overall bank credit quality 
management expects future growth in the loan portfolio to come from increased originations of commercial real estate and business loans as well as expanded geographic outreach facilitated by the acquisition 
securities 
the bank s security portfolio decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  securities were of total assets at december  as compared to at december  during  securities were purchased primarily to replace investments with relatively low yields when compared to the current market 
management purchases securities to maintain sufficient liquidity and to provide yield to offset declines in the loan portfolio when they occur 
liabilities 
monarch s deposits increased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  this increase was primarily in certificates of deposit cds as the bank increased its reliance on brokered cds to maintain sufficient liquidity and to fund repayment of borrowings 
brokered cds increased from million at december  to million at december  the bank did experience a million increase in non interest bearing deposit accounts and a million increase in money market accounts 
most of the increase in money market accounts came from our investors money market account which offers a high interest rate compared to our competition 
the bank did not experience deposit increases in other areas and continues to compete for core deposits 
federal home loan bank advances decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was primarily due to repayment of outstanding advances and the replacement of these advances with brokered deposits 
in an effort to manage our interest rate risk  monarch is decreasing its dependency on federal home loan bank advances and intends to replace these funds with core deposits  brokered deposits  and in some cases if necessary  lower yielding advances in an environment where it appears that interest rates are expected to fall 
the interest rates paid on advances is high relative to current market rates  and reducing our dependency on them should help improve net interest margin as long as interest rates continue to fall 
equity 
total equity amounted to million at december  and million at december   or and  respectively  of total assets at both dates 
the decrease in equity over the period was due primarily to net income of million offset by the repurchase of million in common stock and the payment of  in dividends

monarch reported net income of million for the year ended december  compared to net income of million for the year ended december  and a net loss of million in the increase in earnings in was primarily due to a million decrease in total non interest expense offset by a million decrease in non interest income and zero loss provision in whereas a million recovery of loan loss provision was recorded in net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan losses increased to million for compared to million in total interest income increased million primarily from a million increase in interest income on loans and a million increase in total interest income on federal funds sold  overnight deposits and investment securities 
the increase in interest expense is summarized in the interest expense paragraph below 
net interest income  continued our net interest margin decreased from in to in due to yields on interest bearing liabilities increasing more rapidly in to in than yields on interest earning assets in to in 
our net interest margin increased from in to in because yields on interest earning assets increased in to in and yields on interest bearing liabilities in to in slightly decreased 
interest income 
interest income increased million during the year ended december  the key factors contributing to this growth were a million increase in loans secured by real estate  a million increase in home equity loans and lines of credit  and a rising interest rate environment that did not level off until the third quarter of the average yield on earning assets increased as a result of these factors as well as much higher yields on fed funds  overnight deposits and investment securities 
please also note that the bank had an adjustment correcting the calculation of net deferred fees which increased interest income in the fourth quarter of by approximately  most of which corrected net deferred fees on certain loans originated in the last five years 
interest income increased million in primarily as a result of a million increase in home equity loans and lines of credit  a million increase in investment securities  and a rising interest rate environment that lasted throughout the average yield on earning assets increased as a result of these factors as well as much higher yields on fed funds  overnight deposits and investment securities 
interest expense 
total interest expense increased million in this was primarily due to a million increase in our cost of funds for deposits where brokered deposits increased million in which was partially offset by a  decrease in our cost of funds resulting from net repayments of federal home loan bank advances totaling million 
the overall yield on advances increased from in to in but is expected to decline in subsequent years as these advances are projected to be replaced should they be needed with deposits and or advances having a lower cost 
total interest expense increased  in this was primarily due to a  increase in our cost of funds for deposits which was partially offset by a  decrease in our cost of funds resulting from net repayments of federal home loan bank advances totaling million 
provision for loan losses 
the bank recorded no provision for loan losses for the year ended december  compared to a recovery of provisions totaling  for the year ended december  this was because of improved asset quality  a lower level of non performing assets  and a lower level of charge offs compared to previous years 
the bank will consider provisions in future periods if there are changes in asset quality or other trends noted above 
the recovery of provisions in was possible due to the bank receiving payoffs on two loan relationships totaling million for which the bank had previously provided loan loss allowances of the bank s net charge offs were million in compared to million for the decreased charge offs in are primarily the result of aggressive collection efforts since  improved credit quality of our loan portfolio that led to a lower level non performing assets  and a lower level of delinquencies 
maintaining asset quality remains a priority of management 
see loans discussion above 
the bank s net charge offs were million in compared to million for the increased charge offs in provided for in are primarily the result of losses incurred on the sale of problem loans completed during the second quarter of as well as the bank continuing to aggressively deal with problem loans 
during the past several years we have continued to be aggressive in foreclosing on delinquent one to four family loans in an attempt to improve the credit quality of our loan portfolio and the result has been higher than historical charge offs  as well as decreased delinquencies on this type of loans 
non interest income 
non interest income was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively a decrease of 
fees and service charges on deposit accounts increased  as the bank increased its level of bounce protection on customer direct deposit accounts effective may  and its non sufficient funds fee from to per transaction effective september  both of which led to an increase of  in nsf fees 
other factors contributing to the increase in fees and service charges were a  increase in loan related fees as the bank developed new mortgage banking relationships with four brokerage companies in june which led to  in new fee income as well as a  increase in fees for certificates of deposit early withdrawal penalties and a  increase in atm debit card income 
gain on sale of loans decreased  to  from  a year ago as mortgage banking activities continue to decline due to lower than expected volume of originations for compared to for partly resulting from interest rates that were higher than they were last year 
other income decreased  from  in to  in primarily due to a  decrease in rental income from  in to  in  a  increase in net losses on the sale of real estate owned from a  net gain in compared to a  net loss in  a  decrease in investment services income from  in to  in  and a  decrease to in in net gains on sales of fixed assets including the jonesville branch in 
in  the bank was receiving rental income related to a foreclosed property that was subsequently sold 
the bank also had a  loss on the sale of securities as management replaced two agency securities and one municipal security with tax free municipal securities earning higher interest rates in anticipation of what management expects to be falling interest rates in non interest income was million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
fees and service charges on deposit accounts increased  due to higher fee levels from our overdraft protection program 
loan servicing fees increased  as a result of a larger loan servicing portfolio 
other remaining non interest income increased  due to larger net gains on the sale of foreclosed properties  in compared to  in  higher rental income  in compared to  in  and no gains or losses on investment securities for compared to  in losses on the sale of investments in the increased fees helped offset a decrease in gains from sale of loans which decreased to  compared to  for the year ended december  as mortgage banking activities continued to decline 
non interest expense 
non interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of 
salaries and employee benefits decreased  primarily due to a  decrease in total employee salaries and wages including payroll taxes  and a  decrease in health insurance expense resulting primarily from revision to the bank s medical coverage plans for calendar year offset by  in stock option expenses as the bank implemented sfas no 
r in  a  increase in pension fund expense  and a  increase in restricted stock expense 
occupancy and equipment expense decreased  primarily due to lower depreciation expense 
professional services expense decreased  due to a  reduction in legal expense  a  reduction in audit and accounting expense  and a  reduction in regulatory examination costs 
other decreases in professional fees were not individually significant 
expense control and revenue enhancement continue to be challenges for management as efforts continue on improving efficiency 
in september  management with approval from the board of directors decided to downsize certain departments in order to position the company for improved financial results 
this resulted in a reduction of full time equivalent employees ftes in the fourth quarter of management also decided to reduce employee benefits in october that include reducing the employer match in the company s k plan by an estimated  annual savings and extending the time the company allocates esop shares to employees from years to years estimated to be a  annual savings for 
as strategic planning for continues  ways to enhance revenue and improve expense control continued to be pursued 
management is confident that the actions taken to control expenses will not affect the company s ability to fulfill its obligations to its customers and shareholders 
repossessed property expenses decreased  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in management recorded  in write downs of foreclosed properties for compared to  in the bank also had a  increase in foreclosed property operating expenses for the same period 
amortization of core deposit intangible decreased  and amortization of mortgage servicing rights mortgage banking expense decreased  consistent with the decline in refinancing for the year ended december  other general and administrative expenses decreased  for year ended december  as compared to the same period for primarily due to a  decrease in office supplies and printing expenses  a  decrease in expenses related to indirect lending as the bank exited this type of lending  a  decrease in telephone expense  and a  decrease in employee education and business travel expense offset by a  increase in advertising and promotion expense used for professional services for an extensive marketing campaign 
all other increases in non interest expense were not significant 
non interest expense increased  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  repossessed property expense increased to  in from  in as a result of the bank taking  in write downs based on recent assessments of the appraised value of repossessions 
data processing expense increased to  in from  in as we continue to stay current with advancing technology which involved a  increase in service bureau expense  a  increase in licenses and software expense data processing expense and a  increase in other related expense most of which were data processing maintenance expenses 
amortization of core deposit intangible amounted to  for compared to  in we expect the expense to be approximately  in and will carefully monitor whether additional amortization is needed 
amortization of mortgage servicing rights amounted to  for compared to  in we expect the expense for to be higher than in as our portfolio continues to grow 
all other increases in non interest expense were not significant 
federal income taxes 
monarch recorded an income tax expense for the year ended december  of  on income before tax of million which represented an effective tax rate of of income before tax 
in  we recorded an income tax expense of  which also represented an effective tax rate of of income before tax 
the difference between the effective tax rates and the federal corporate income tax rate of is attributable to the low income housing credits available to the bank from the investment in the limited partnership as well as fluctuation of permanent book and tax differences such as non taxable income and non deductible expenses 
liquidity and commitments we are required to maintain appropriate levels of liquid assets under fdic regulations 
liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon the availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans 
historically  we have maintained liquid assets at levels above those believed to be adequate to meet the requirements of normal operations  including potential deposit outflows 
at december   our liquidity ratio  which is our liquid assets as a percentage of net withdrawable savings deposits with a maturity of one year or less and current borrowings  was 
this level of liquidity is lower than that maintained last year but management is confident they will be able to effectively address the bank s liquidity needs while facilitating increased profitability 
monarch s liquidity  represented by cash and cash equivalents  is a product of our operating  investing and financing activities 
monarch s primary sources of funds are deposits  amortization  prepayments and maturities of outstanding loans  overnight deposits and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and overnight deposits are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
monarch also generates cash through borrowings 
monarch utilizes federal home loan bank advances to leverage its capital base and provide funds for its lending and investment activities  and to enhance its interest rate risk management 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
excess liquidity is generally invested in overnight deposits and short term treasury and governmental agency securities 
on a longer term basis  monarch maintains a strategy of investing in various investments and lending products 
monarch uses its sources of funds primarily to meet its ongoing commitments  to pay maturing certificates of deposit and savings withdrawals and to fund loan commitments 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at december   totaled million 
based on historical experience  management believes that a significant portion of these certificates of deposit can be retained by continuing to pay competitive interest rates 
if necessary  additional funding sources include additional deposits including core deposits  brokered deposits  and federal home loan bank advances 
management is committed to increasing our core deposit balances and is willing to offer interest rates higher than those of the competition 
based on current collateral levels  at december   monarch could borrow an additional million from the federal home loan bank at prevailing interest rates 
this borrowing capacity can be increased in the future if monarch pledges additional collateral  such as securities  to the federal home loan bank 
monarch anticipates that it will continue to have sufficient funds  through deposits and borrowings  to meet its current commitments 
for the year ended december   monarch had a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of  as compared to a net increase of  million for the year ended december  the bank s primary sources of funds during were net income of million  a net increase in deposits totaling million  proceeds from federal home loan bank advances totaling million  proceeds from the sale of foreclosed assets totaling million and proceeds from the sales and maturities of securities totaling million 
the primary uses of funds in were for purchases of investments totaling million  repayments of federal home loan bank advances totaling million  and net loan originations and principal collections totaling million 
the bank s primary sources of funds during were net income of million  a net increase in deposits totaling million  proceeds from federal home loan bank advances totaling million  proceeds from the sale of foreclosed assets totaling million and proceeds from the maturities of securities totaling million 
the primary uses of funds in were for purchases of investments of million and repayments of federal home loan bank advances totaling million 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   the total unused commercial and consumer lines of credit were million 
as of december   there were outstanding commitments under letters of credit of  at december   the total unused commercial and consumer lines of credit were million 
as of december  there were outstanding commitments under letters of credit of  the company has no arrangements with any other entities that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
contractual obligations the company has certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts 
at december   the aggregate contractual obligations and commitments are payments due by period total less than year years years after years dollars in thousands certificates of deposit fhlb advances total amount of commitment expiration per period total less than year years years after years dollars in thousands commitments to grant loans unfunded commitments under helocs unfunded commitments under commercial locs letters of credit total long term obligations also include the liability under the company s director deferred compensation plans 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the plans 
capital consistent with its goals to operate a sound and profitable financial organization  monarch actively seeks to maintain a well capitalized institution in accordance with regulatory standards 
as of december   monarch exceeded all capital requirements of the fdic 
monarch s regulatory capital ratios at that date were as follows tier leverage capital  tier risk based capital  and total risk based capital  
the regulatory capital requirements to be considered well capitalized are  and  respectively 
in  management does not anticipate seeking additional capital 
on january   management issued a press release announcing an intention to repurchase  of its outstanding shares in the open market in block trades or privately negotiated transactions 
the repurchase program was effective january  and  shares were repurchased 
on february   the board of directors voted unanimously to approve a reverse merger transaction which would reduce the number of total shareholders below the merger is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of subject to regulatory  sec and shareholder approval 
as a result  if the reverse merger is completed  the company intends to terminate the registration of its stock with the sec and cause the stock to cease to be traded on the nasdaq capital market 
additional information regarding the reverse merger is summarized in note subsequent event in the audited consolidated financial report for impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
impact of inflation  continued our primary assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates  however  do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the price of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation 
in a period of rapidly rising interest rates  the liquidity and maturity structures of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels 
the principal effect of inflation  as distinct from levels of interest rates  on earnings is in the area of non interest expense 
such expense items as employee compensation  employee benefits and occupancy and equipment costs may be subject to increases as a result of inflation 
an additional effect of inflation is the possible increase in the dollar value of the collateral securing loans that we have made 
we are unable to determine the extent  if any  to which properties securing our loans have appreciated in dollar value due to inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management and market risk our risk when interest rates change 
the rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
market interest rates change over time 
accordingly  our results of operations  like those of other financial institutions  are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk 
how we measure our risk of interest rate changes 
as part of our attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations  we monitor our interest rate risk 
in monitoring interest rate risk  we continually analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates  the timing of their maturities  and their sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates 
the board of directors sets and recommends the asset and liability policies of the bank which are implemented by the asset and liability management committee 
the asset and liability management committee is comprised of members of our senior management 
the purpose of the asset and liability management committee is to communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management consistent with our business plan and board approved policies 
the asset and liability management committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs 
the objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the asset and liability management committee generally meets on a monthly basis to review  among other things  economic conditions and interest rate outlook  current and projected liquidity needs and capital position  anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and interest rate risk exposure limits versus current projections 
the chief financial officer is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the effects of the policy implementation and strategies to the board of directors  at least quarterly 
in order to manage our assets and liabilities and achieve the desired liquidity  credit quality  interest rate risk  profitability and capital targets  we have focused our strategies on originating shorter term consumer loans  commercial construction and commercial permanent real estate loans for retention in our portfolio  selling a significant portion of the long term  fixed rate residential mortgage loans we make  managing our deposits to establish stable deposit relationships with an emphasis on core  non certificate deposits  supplementing these with brokered deposits  as appropriate  and maintaining longer term borrowings at fixed interest rates to offset the negative impact of longer term fixed rate loans in our loan portfolio 
future borrowings are expected to be short term to reduce the average maturity of our borrowings 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  the asset and liability management committee may determine to increase monarch s interest rate risk position somewhat in order to maintain the net interest margin 
in addition  in an effort to manage our interest rate risk and liquidity  in and we sold million and million  respectively  of fixed rate  one to four family mortgage loans in the secondary market 
we expect to continue to sell a significant portion of our originated long term  fixed rate  one to four family loans but may retain some portion of our year and shorter  fixed rate loans 
monarch uses an internally generated model that uses scenario analysis to evaluate the irr exposure of the bank by estimating the sensitivity of the bank s portfolios of assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts to changes in market interest rates 
the information presented in the following table presents the expected change in monarch s net portfolio value at december  that would occur upon an immediate change in interest rates 
change in interest rates basis points bp rate shock in rates net portfolio value net portfolio value as of present value of assets amount change change npv ratio change bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
data from the model indicates that the bank s irr level remains minimal 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  if interest rates change  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
the bank  like other financial institutions  is affected by changes in market interest rates 
our net interest margin can change  either positively or negatively  as the result of increases or decreases in market interest rates 
some factors affecting net interest margin are outside of our control  market interest rates are but one factor affecting the bank s net interest margin 
however  management has the ability  through its asset liability management and pricing policies to affect the bank s net interest margin notwithstanding the level of market interest rates 
the preceding table indicates the bank s net portfolio value will decrease in an increasing interest rate scenario and increase in a decreasing interest rate scenario 
management believes that its net interest margin will behave similarly 
if rising interest rates stifle loan demand or create additional competitive pressures in attracting and retaining deposits  the bank s desire for growth in total assets may cause management to alter its strategy that could negatively impact the net interest margin 
the timing and magnitude of interest rate changes  as well as the sector affected short term vs 
long term will have an impact on the bank s net interest margin 
the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes to interest rates as of december  the company had no derivative instruments  or trading portfolio as of that date 
the expected maturity date values for loans receivable  mortgage backed securities and investment securities were calculated without adjusting the contractual maturity dates for expectations of repayments 
expected maturity date values for non maturity  interest bearing deposits were based on the opportunity for repricing 
principal amount maturing in and beyond total fair value rate sensitive assets fed funds and overnight deposits average interest rate securities average interest rate gross loans average interest rate rate sensitive liabilities savings interest bearing demand deposits average interest rate certificates of deposit average interest rate fhlb advances average interest rate
