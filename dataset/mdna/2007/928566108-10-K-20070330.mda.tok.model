business overview we are a leading provider of medical devices for the minimally invasive treatment of venous reflux disease  a progressive condition caused by incompetent vein valves in the legs 
we also provide devices for use in the minimally invasive treatment of other peripheral vascular diseases  including devices for use in peripheral arterial bypass and arteriovenous graft procedures 
venous reflux disease results in symptoms such as leg pain  swelling  fatigue  skin ulcers and painful varicose veins 
our primary product line  the closure system  consists of a proprietary rf generator and proprietary disposable endovenous catheters and devices to close diseased veins through the application of temperature controlled rf energy 
we estimate that in excess of  patients have been treated using our closure system since in the first quarter of  we fully launched our closurerfs family of products  which can be used for perforator vein ablation 
in february  we began the market introduction our new closurefast catheter 
we believe that this is a significant advancement of the closure procedure and in the field of minimally invasive treatment of venous reflux 
since our inception in january  we have focused on the development of minimally invasive treatments for venous reflux disease 
until  our operations consisted primarily of start up activities  including the development of our closure system  recruiting personnel and raising capital 
we launched commercial sales of our closure system in europe in late and in the united states in late 
table of contents for the year ended december   we generated net revenues of million and net loss of million 
as of december   we have incurred cumulative losses of approximately million 
from inception to september  we were not profitable 
we were profitable beginning in the last quarter of through we made significant investments in our operations during and plan to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing operations through we incurred a net loss for and project the same for we market our closure system through a direct sales organization in the united states and france and subsidiaries in germany and the united kingdom 
we also market and sell our products through distributors throughout the world 
most of our us customers are reimbursed by governmental and third party payors  and that reimbursement is subject to periodic review and adjustment 
currently  our closure procedure is covered by the policies of approximately health insurers  representing over million covered lives in the united states 
our net revenues are derived from the sale of disposable endovenous catheters and devices  rf generators and accessory products  which comprised  and of our net revenues  respectively  in we began promoting the features and benefits of our new closurefast catheter during the third quarter of however  a software upgrade  which has not yet been released  is required for the vnus rf generator to function with all vnus disposable catheters and devices for the treatment of venous reflux  including the new closurefast catheter  which resulted in sales of these rf generators being deferred 
presently  the software upgrade is an undelivered element and has no established fair value  requiring the deferral of revenue from the entire sale until the software upgrade is delivered to the customer 
as of march   we have commenced delivery of the software upgrade and the deferred revenue from these sales is expected to be recognized as the software upgrade is installed 
the total amount of revenue deferred in related to the software upgrade is million 
we expect that the percentage of net revenues derived from the sales of disposable catheters and rf generators to shift during due to the recognition of deferred sales of rf generators from the second half of we manufacture  package and label our disposable endovenous catheters and devices and outsource the manufacture of our rf generators and accessory packs 
we have a diverse customer base of hospitals  physicians and physician groups  with no customer accounting for or more of our net revenues or accounts receivable in the years ended december   and financial operations overview net revenues 
our net revenues are derived primarily from the sale of disposable endovenous catheters and rf generators 
our installed base of rf generators facilitates a recurring revenue stream from the sale of disposable catheters 
in addition  we derive a small portion of our revenues from the sale of accessory products 
cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues represents the cost of materials  overhead  direct labor and delivery charges associated with the manufacture of disposable catheters  the purchase and delivery of rf generators  the purchase and delivery of accessory products  depreciation and amortization of stock based compensation 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of marketing personnel compensation  sales force incentive compensation  travel  promotional materials  advertising  patient education materials  other expenses incurred to provide reimbursement services and clinical training and amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses  supplies  materials and expenses associated with product development  expenses associated with preclinical and clinical studies and amortization of related deferred stock based compensation 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses for accounting  human resources  information technology and corporate administration  legal fees  accounting fees  facilities expenses and amortization of related deferred stock based compensation 

table of contents internal control matters we concluded in item a of this form k that our disclosure controls and procedures  and internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of december   the end of our fiscal year covered by this annual report 
item a provides a summary of the material weakness as of that date that we identified in management s assessment of internal control and other related information 
see also in item a risk factors if we continue to fail to achieve and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on a consolidated basis  our ability to provide accurate financial reports could be impaired and our stock price and investor confidence in our company could be materially and adversely affected 
change to previously reported results on february   we issued a press release reporting our unaudited results for the three and twelve months ended december   a copy of which was furnished with a report on form k on february  the material weakness referenced above resulted in an adjustment to our unaudited fiscal annual consolidated financial statements of approximately  the effect of this adjustment on the unaudited consolidated statement of operations increased expenses and net loss by approximately  or per share and per share  from per share to per share and per share to per share  for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate our judgments and estimates  including those related to doubtful accounts  income taxes and loss contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our belief of what could occur in the future considering available information  including assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition 
we sell our disposable catheters and radio frequency  or rf  generators  to end users in the united states and in international markets 
catheters and rf generators are also sold through distributors in international markets 
we also sell rf generators to third party leasing companies in the united states 
these third party leasing companies provide long term lease financing to end users 
we do not provide such long term lease financing to end users 
we recognize revenues from the sale of our products in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title has transferred  our price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for an arrangement with multiple deliverables  we recognize product sales in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables with revenues allocated among the different elements  and in accordance with eitf no 
 applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software 
where software is more than incidental to the product or the arrangement  the company recognizes revenues for those products in accordance with sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 software revenue recognition with respect to certain agreements 
we recognize revenues when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred  collection of the related receivable is probable 
where software is incidental to the product or arrangement  we recognize revenues from the sale of those products in accordance with sab no 

table of contents revenues earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements are allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value vsoe  which is based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
in instances when evidence of vsoe of all undelivered elements exists  but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  revenues are recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
in instances when evidence of vsoe of all undelivered elements does not exist  revenues are deferred on the entire arrangement until all of the undelivered elements have been delivered  or evidence of vsoe of the undelivered element exists 
we generally use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
we use shipping documents and third party proof of delivery to verify delivery 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the terms of the agreement associated with the transaction 
in order to determine whether collection is reasonably assured  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer the recognition of revenue until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
our domestic and international return policy allows customers to return unused products for a period of and days  respectively  subject to restocking fees 
we make provisions for estimated returns and allowances based on historical levels 
to date  returns and allowances have been insignificant 
if actual returns and allowances were to deviate significantly from our estimates  our revenues could be adversely affected 
valuation of inventory 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we calculate an inventory reserve for estimated obsolescence or excess inventory based upon historical demand and assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
the allowance is measured as the difference between the current cost of the inventory and estimated market value and is charged to the provision for inventory obsolescence  which is a component of our cost of revenues 
at the point of recognition of the loss  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology  we could be required to increase our inventory allowance and our gross profit could be adversely affected 
historically  we have not had a significant incidence of inventory obsolescence 
warranty costs 
at the time we recognize revenues  we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expense associated with revenues  recorded as a component of cost of revenues 
we offer a one year limited warranty on our rf generator which is included in the sales price of the generator 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based upon the number of units sold  historical and anticipated cost per claim and rates of warranty claims 
we primarily estimate material costs based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment 
our service agreement with our rf generator manufacturer provides us with a warranty on the generators for the shorter of months from the date of shipment to us or months from the date of first use 
as such  our warranty expense is only required to cover those expenses not covered by our service agreement 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty accruals are made for specific technical problems 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience  or if costs of servicing warranty claims are greater than the expectations on which the accrual has been based  our gross profit could be adversely affected 
historically  our warranty claims have been immaterial 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate the allowance based on the aging of account balances  collection history  credit quality of the customer and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
we maintain a diverse customer base that mitigates the risk of concentration with one customer 
however  if the overall condition of the healthcare industry were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of our customers ability to make payments  significant additional allowances could be required 
additionally  if a major customer s creditworthiness deteriorates  or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  and additional allowances could be required  which could have an adverse impact on our financial results 

table of contents income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the liability method 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the tax consequences of most events recognized in the current year s financial statements are included in determining income taxes currently payable 
however  because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenues  expenses and gains and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in our financial statements 
because it is assumed that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount on the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of the assets are recovered 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and unless we believe that recovery is more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes 
this process involves estimating our current tax liability  together with assessing temporary differences that may result in deferred tax assets 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rates due to the impact of net operating loss carryforwards  research and experimentation tax credits  state taxes and the tax impact of non us operations 
because we have had a history of net losses from inception through the year ended december  and for the year ended december  and because we are projecting a net loss in  recovery of our deferred tax assets is in doubt and we have established a valuation allowance against the entire balance of our deferred tax assets 
if we are able to demonstrate consistent profitability in the future  and we are able to establish that recovery is more likely than not  we would reduce our valuation allowance at a future date 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
in addition  we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities  however  we are not currently under audit by any taxing jurisdiction 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
share based compensation expense 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r under provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
sab using the modified prospective approach and therefore  have not restated results for prior periods 
under this approach  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
r  we recorded stock based compensation as a charge to earnings  net of the estimated impact of forfeited awards 
as such  we recognize stock based compensation cost only for those awards that are estimated to ultimately vest over their requisite service period  based on the vesting provisions of the individual grants 
we have no awards with market conditions 
we recognize stock based compensation cost on awards with performance conditions as they vest  if we believe that the performance conditions will be met 
on november   the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb staff position no 
fas no 
r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards 
we have elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in this fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects of share based compensation pursuant to sfas no 
r 
the alternative transition method includes a simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool related to the tax effects of employee share based compensation  which is available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
there was no tax benefit realized upon exercise of stock options during the twelve months ended december  prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we accounted for stock based awards under the intrinsic method of accounting principles board opinion no

table of contents compensation expense had been recognized in the statements of operations because the exercise price of the stock option granted equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant  other than compensation expense calculated under the minimum value method provisions of sfas no 
for certain options granted prior to our initial public offering in october pro forma net income loss and pro forma net income loss per share disclosed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements were estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
in accordance with sfas no 
r and sab  we used the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of our stock base awards 
the determination of fair value for stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model requires management to make certain assumptions regarding i the expected volatility in the market price of our common stock over the expected term of the awards  ii dividend yield  iii risk free interest rates  and iv actual and projected employee exercise behaviors referred to as the expected term 
the expected volatility is based on the combination of historical volatility from our common stock and certain industry peers for the expected term in effect on the date of grant 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us zero coupon treasury yield for the expected term in effect on the date of grant 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding 
we award a limited number of stock options and restricted stock units rsus to non employees 
in  we started to grant stock based awards with performance conditions 
in anticipation of the adoption of sfas r  we started to award restricted stock units in lieu of certain incentive stock option awards in we account for non cash stock based expense from options and rsus issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r and emerging issues task force pronouncement no 
 accounting for equity investments that are issued to non employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
for these options and rsus  we recognize the non cash stock based expense over the service period of the underlying awards  based on an estimate of their fair value on the vesting dates using the black scholes option pricing model 
all unvested options issued to non employees are marked to market until such options vest 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf 
eitf provides that the presentation of taxes assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer on either a gross basis included in revenues and costs or on a net basis excluded from revenues is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed 
eitf is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we plan to adopt eitf in the first quarter of the adoption of eitf is not anticipated to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute  as well as criteria for subsequently recognizing  derecognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions for financial statement purposes 
fin also requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income tax assets and liabilities 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and is required to be recognized as a change in accounting principle through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption 
we plan to adopt fin in the first quarter of and are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on september   the securities and exchange commission the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no

 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
this statement is required to be adopted by vnus in the first quarter of our fiscal year we are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of sfas no

results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as percentages of revenues  for the years ended december   and years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income and other  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net loss income the following table sets forth the percentage of net revenues derived from the sale of disposable endovenous catheters and devices  rf generators and accessories for the years ended december   and years ended december  catheters and devices rf generators accessories 
table of contents the following table sets forth the percentage of net revenues from domestic and international sales for the years ended december    and years ended december  united states europe other international net revenues 
net revenues increased  or million  to million in from million in net revenues increased  or million in from million in the increase in was primarily due to increased sales of the closureplus tm catheter  the closurerfs tm family of devices  the u clip tm device and accessory products in the us to existing customers and to customers added during the year  partially offset by lower rf generator revenues due to fewer sales in over combined with the deferral of million revenue on sales of all new rf generators in the second half of due to a software upgrade 
as of march   we have commenced delivery of a software upgrade and the deferred revenue from these sales is expected to be recognized as the software upgrade is installed 
the increased revenues in were also partially offset by a decline in the average us selling price of disposable catheters 
the increase in over was primarily due to an increase in the number of disposable catheters and rf generators sold as a result of our increased direct selling and marketing efforts in the united states  as well as the limited launch of the closurerfs tm family of products and additional single use accessories 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in the average us selling price of disposable catheters and an decline in the average selling price of us rf generators 
we expect net revenues to increase in with the introduction of our new closurefast catheter at the end of the first quarter 
we also expect price discounting to continue due to competitive pressures 
our product sales mix shifted in due to lower rf generator sales and the deferral of rf generator sales in the second half of the year 
international sales accounted for of net revenues in  the same as in and we expect that the percent of net revenues from international sales will increase to approximately of net revenues in with the opening of our direct sales office in the united kingdom in january gross profit 
cost of revenues increased  or million  to million in  from million in cost of revenues increased  or million in  from million in the increases in and were primarily due to the increased number of disposable catheters sold  partially offset by lower sales of rf generators in and lower direct material and labor costs per unit in the production of disposable catheters 
the impact on gross margin from the deferred rf generators revenue was million in gross profit in was million  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues in and million  or of net revenues in the decrease in gross profit margin percentage in was primarily due to lower sales of higher margin rf generators 
in addition  manufacturing overhead increased in due to costs of our new facility of  and increased compensation cost of  due to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
the gross profit margin percentage in was unchanged from  primarily due to the allocation of manufacturing overhead over a greater number of units produced  as well as reduced direct costs of production per unit of our disposable catheters  partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of our disposable catheters 
we expect prices of our disposable catheters to continue to decline in increased catheter production volume is expected to absorb some portion of increased overhead expense 
as a result  we expect that our gross margin percentage in will be comparable to our gross margin percentage in sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased  or million  to million in  from million in sales and marketing expenses increased  or million in  from million in the increase in was primarily the result of a million increase in payroll and related expenses including a increase in headcount and a  increase in stock based compensation from the adoption of sfas no 
r 
in addition  facility costs for our new corporate headquarters allocated to sales and marketing increased  trade show expenses increased  and travel expenses increased  these increases were partially offset by decreased training and literature costs of  the increase in was primarily the result of increased payroll and related expenses of million incurred related 
table of contents to a increase in sales and marketing personnel as well as a  increase in product promotion and advertising expenses 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in as we market our new closurefast catheter through a direct to consumer advertising campaign and increase sales and marketing activity related to new products 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased  or million to million in from million in research and development expenses decreased  or  in from million in the increase in was primarily due to a tripling of project related expenses by million for consulting  materials and clinical trial costs related to new products  including our new closurefast catheter 
further  payroll and related expenses increased in by million primarily due to a increase in headcount to support product development efforts combined with a  increase in stock based compensation expense from the implementation of sfas no 
r 
in addition  facility costs for our new corporate headquarters allocated to research and development increased  which was partially offset by a  decrease in research and development expenses that were charged to product cost to support improvements in the manufacturability of existing products 
the decrease in was primarily due to a decrease in project related expenses of  as well as  in research and development expenses that were charged to product cost to support improvements in the manufacturability of existing products 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in as we continue to invest in the development of new products and the need to conduct new clinical studies 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million in  from million in general and administrative expenses increased  or million in from million in the increase in included a million increase in legal fees related to our patent litigation 
payroll and related expenses increased by million due in part to a increase in headcount in combination with an  increase in stock based compensation from the implementation of sfas no 
r 
further  included  of restructuring charges from the relocation of our corporate headquarters and a  increase in facility costs for our new corporate headquarters allocated to general and administrative  which were offset by a decrease in consulting and professional services fees of million due in part to bringing support staff for section of the sarbanes oxley act of in house 
the increase in was primarily due to consulting and accounting fees related to compliance with regulations applicable to public companies  including section of the sarbanes oxley act of  in the amount of million  increased personnel expenses of million  increased insurance expenses of  as well as  in bank fees and  in bad debt expense 
also   was incurred in legal fees to pursue patent infringement litigation 
we expect general and administrative expenses to remain relatively flat in compared with interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net  increased  or million  to million in  from million in interest income and other  net  increased  or million in from  in the increase in was primarily due to higher interest rates earned on our interest bearing accounts 
the increase in was primarily due to increased average cash and short term investment balances in and to a lesser extent  higher interest rates earned on our interest bearing accounts 
we expect interest income and other to decrease slightly in primarily due to utilization of cash and short term investments to support operations 
provision for income taxes 
we have significant net operating loss nol and tax credit carryforwards 
the  and  provisions for income taxes in and  respectively  primarily represent the estimated federal and state income taxes payable  reduced for the use of nol and tax credit carryforwards 
we expect to use nol and other tax carryforward amounts to the extent taxable income is earned in and beyond 
at december   we had federal nol carryforwards of approximately million and state nol carryforwards of approximately million 
the federal nol carryforwards expire in various periods from through and the state nol carry forwards expire in various periods from through we have federal and state research tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal research credits expire in various periods through and the state research credits can be carried forward indefinitely 
we also have federal and state amt credit carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively 
the amt credits carry forward indefinitely 
the amounts of and the benefits from nol and credit 
table of contents carryforwards may be impaired in some circumstances 
events that may cause such limitations include  but are not limited to  sale of equity securities and other changes in ownership 
we have historically experienced significant operating losses and operate in an industry subject to rapid technological changes 
additionally  we are projecting a net loss in therefore  we believe there is sufficient uncertainty regarding our ability to generate future taxable income and use these nol and tax credit carryforwards such that a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was required at december  we will retain a full valuation allowance until such time that we determine it is more likely than not that we will recognize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
prior to the release of the valuation allowance  to the extent that we are profitable  our effective tax rate should continue to be substantially less than the applicable statutory rates 
following the release of our valuation allowance  our effective tax rate will approximate the applicable statutory rates 
liquidity and capital resources december  cash and cash equivalents short term investments working capital net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities we incurred net losses from inception through december  of million 
we are projecting a net loss in we currently invest our cash and cash equivalents in several large money market funds consisting of debt instruments of the us government  its agencies and high quality corporate issuers with original maturities of less than three months 
investments designated as short term consist of cash invested in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year 
since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of convertible preferred stock and common stock  and cash generated from operations 
in addition  we raised approximately million  net of issuance costs  from our initial public offering of common stock in october net cash used in operating activities was  in cash used in operating activities in was attributable primarily to net loss after adjustments for non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  and free rent provisions of our new corporate headquarters lease combined with reduced working capital due to increased deferred revenue partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in deferred revenue was driven by the deferral of rf generators in the second half of combined with a increase in revenue 
the increase in accounts receivable was driven by increased revenue combined with slower billings and collections due to staff turnover 
we added additional staff to credit and collections in january and expect collections to improve in under the terms of our new lease  the landlord provided an allowance for the planning and construction of tenant improvements in the amount of approximately million 
the leasehold improvements made with the allowance have been recorded as deferred rent  which has been reflected as cash provided by operating activities due to an increase in other liabilities in an offsetting amount has been recorded as leasehold improvements 
net cash provided from operating activities was million in cash provided from operating activities in was attributable primarily to net income after adjustments for non cash depreciation and amortization charges  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses  accounts payable and other long term assets 
the increases in accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable were driven by a increase in revenue  to million in from million in the increase in prepaid and other expenses in primarily reflects an increase in interest receivable on short term investments 
we did not have any short term investments in the increase in other long term assets in reflects the deposit made on our new facility 
net cash provided from operating activities was million in cash provided from operating activities in was attributable primarily to net income after adjustments for non cash depreciation and amortization charges  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid

for  cash used in investing activities primarily reflects purchases of property and equipment primarily for research and development  information technology  manufacturing operations and facility improvements 
under the terms of our new lease  the landlord provided an allowance for the planning and construction of tenant improvements in the amount of approximately million 
the leasehold improvements made with the allowance were recorded as leasehold improvements upon being placed into service  which has been reflected as a use of cash in investing activities in an offsetting amount was recorded as deferred rent 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in  million in  and million in the and amounts reflect proceeds received upon the exercise of stock options 
the amount primarily reflects proceeds received upon our initial public offering in october and the exercise of stock options 
we expect that marketing and research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in connection with the growth of our business 
we expect to fund these increased costs and expenditures from our cash flows from operations and our existing cash balance 
however  our future capital requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following the revenues generated by sales of our products  the costs associated with expanding our manufacturing  marketing  sales and distribution efforts  the rate of progress and cost of our research and development activities  patent litigation  the costs of obtaining and maintaining food and drug administration and other regulatory clearances of our products and products in development  the effects of competing technological and market developments  the costs associated with being a public company and the number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  and cash we expect to generate from operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may require additional funds in order to further develop the marketplace  complete clinical studies and deliver new products to our customers 
we may seek financing of future cash needs through the sale of equity securities and debt 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  such financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our business operations or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if additional funds are obtained by issuing equity or debt securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  
table of contents contractual obligations and capital expenditure requirements the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations and less than more than capital expenditure requirements total year years years years in thousands operating lease obligations inventory purchase commitments other purchase commitments total on march   we entered into a lease termination agreement termination agreement  effective as of march  with the landlord of our former office space at zanker road in san jose  california the lease 
the lease was scheduled to expire on june  we will pay approximately  in march  but will not be required to pay any further rent and other charges owed under the lease after the effective date of the termination agreement 
the table above includes  in operating lease obligations as of december  due in less than one year related to the lease 
we will also receive  the full amount of our security deposit previously paid under the lease plus interest  less amounts due for march rent through the termination date and any other amounts to which landlord is entitled to apply the security deposit pursuant to the terms of the lease in march see note subsequent event 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk to date  substantially all of our sales have been denominated in us dollars 
approximately of total sales have been denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
accordingly  we believe that there is currently no material exposure to risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to interest rate risk at december  is related to our investment of our excess cash and cash equivalents in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers via several large money market funds 
the funds maintain an average investment maturity of days or less 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that there is currently no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments
