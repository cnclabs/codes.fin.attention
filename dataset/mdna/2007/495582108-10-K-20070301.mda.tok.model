overview our business we are a vertically integrated pharmaceutical company that develops  manufactures  markets and sells branded prescription pharmaceutical products 
to capitalize on opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry  we seek to develop  in license  acquire or obtain commercialization rights to novel branded prescription pharmaceutical products in attractive markets 
our corporate strategy is focused on three key therapeutic areas cardiovascular metabolic  neuroscience  and hospital acute care products 
we believe each of our key therapeutic areas has significant market potential and our organization is aligned accordingly 
we work to achieve organic growth by maximizing the potential of our currently marketed products through sales and marketing and product life cycle management 
we also work to achieve organic growth through the successful development of new branded pharmaceutical products 
additionally  we seek to achieve growth through the acquisition or in licensing of novel branded pharmaceutical products in various stages of development and technologies that have significant market potential that complement our three key therapeutic areas 
we may also seek company acquisitions which add products or products in development  technologies or sales and marketing capabilities to our key therapeutic areas or that otherwise complement our operations 

table of contents utilizing our internal resources and a disciplined business development process  we strive to be a leader and partner of choice in bringing innovative  clinically differentiated therapies and technologies to market in our key therapeutic areas 
our business consists of five segments which include branded pharmaceuticals  meridian medical technologies  royalties  contract manufacturing  and other 
in accordance with our strategy  our branded pharmaceutical products can be divided into the following therapeutic areas cardiovascular metabolics including altace and levoxyl  neuroscience including skelaxin  avinza and sonata  hospital acute care including thrombin jmi  and other 
our meridian medical technologies segment consists of our auto injector business  which includes epipen and nerve gas antidotes which we provide to the us military 
our royalties segment relates to revenues we derive from successfully developed products that we have licensed to third parties 
our contract manufacturing segment manufactures pharmaceutical products for third parties under contracts with a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
highlights introduction during  we achieved many important accomplishments that we believe better position us for long term growth 
among our many accomplishments  we expanded our portfolio of products  took steps to create opportunities to extend the life cycle of our altace franchise  and advanced projects in our research and development pipeline 
we believe these accomplishments better position us to continue executing our strategy for long term growth in expanded product portfolio on january   we obtained an exclusive license to the hemostatic products designed for use outside catheterization and electrophysiology laboratories by vascular solutions  inc vascular solutions  which include products which we expect to market as thrombi pad tm and thrombi gel hemostats 
the license also includes a product we expect to market as thrombi paste tm  which is currently in development 
each of these products includes thrombin jmi as a component 
vascular solutions will manufacture and supply these products for us 
on september   we entered into an agreement to acquire all the rights to avinza in the united states  its territories and canada from ligand pharmaceuticals incorporated ligand 
avinza is an extended release formulation of morphine and is indicated as a once daily treatment for moderate to severe pain in patients who require continuous opioid therapy for an extended period of time 
we completed our acquisition of avinza on february  under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  we paid ligand million and  in addition  paid certain liabilities  including a product related liability totaling million 
as part of the transaction  we agreed to pay ligand an ongoing royalty on net sales of avinza and to assume payment of ligand s avinza royalty obligations to third parties 
on june   we entered into a co exclusive agreement with depomed  inc depomed to commercialize depomed s glumetza tm product 
glumetza tm is a once daily  extended release formulation of metformin for the treatment of patients with type ii diabetes that depomed developed utilizing its proprietary acuform tm drug delivery technology 
under the terms of the agreement  we assumed responsibility for 
table of contents promoting glumetza tm in the united states and puerto rico  while depomed has the right to co promote the product using its own sales force at some point in the future 
depomed will pay us a fee from gross profit  as defined in the agreement  generally net sales less cost of goods sold less a royalty depomed must pay a third party 
depomed is responsible for the manufacture and distribution of glumetza tm  while we bear all costs related to the use of our sales force for the product 
we launched the promotion of glumetza tm in the third quarter of altace franchise on june   we entered into a co promotion agreement with wyeth to promote altace in the united states and puerto rico through october   with possible extensions as outlined in the co promotion agreement 
under the agreement  wyeth paid an upfront fee to us of million 
in connection with the co promotion agreement  we agreed to pay wyeth a promotional fee based on annual net sales of altace 
on july   we entered into an amended and restated co promotion agreement amended co promotion agreement with wyeth regarding altace 
effective january   we assumed full responsibility for selling and marketing altace 
during  the wyeth sales force continued to co promote the product with us and continued to share marketing expenses 
we paid or will pay wyeth a reduced annual fee as follows for  of altace net sales up to million  of altace net sales in excess of million and less than or equal to million  and of altace net sales that are in excess of million and less than or equal to million  with the fee not to exceed million 
for  of altace net sales  with the fee not to exceed million 
for  of altace net sales  with the fee not to exceed million 
for  of altace net sales  with the fee not to exceed million 
for  of altace net sales  with the fee not to exceed million 
wyeth will pay us a million milestone fee if a specified altace net sales threshold is achieved in in february  we entered into a collaboration with arrow international limited and certain of its affiliates  excluding cobalt pharmaceuticals  inc collectively  arrow  to commercialize one or more novel formulations of ramipril  the active ingredient in our altace product 
under a series of agreements  arrow has granted us rights to certain current and future new drug applications ndas regarding novel formulations of ramipril and intellectual property  including patent rights and technology licenses relating to these novel formulations 
on february   the fda approved an nda arising from this collaboration for an altace tablet formulation 
under certain conditions  arrow will be responsible for the manufacture and supply of new formulations of ramipril for us 
additionally  we have granted cobalt pharmaceuticals  inc a non exclusive right to enter into the us ramipril market with a generic form of the currently marketed altace product  which would be supplied by us 
cobalt is an affiliate of arrow  but is not a party to the collaboration 
pursuant to the agreements  we made an upfront payment to arrow of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we made an additional payment of million to arrow 
arrow will also receive payments from us of million during we classified these payments as in process research and development expense in additionally  arrow will earn fees for the manufacture and supply of new formulations of ramipril 
in addition  we have in development an altace diuretic combination product which is currently in phase iii clinical trials 

table of contents research and development pipeline our current research and development pipeline includes four products in phase iii clinical trials and two products in late phase ii clinical trials 
our phase iii products are led by remoxy tm  an abuse deterrent formulation of long acting oxycodone for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain 
in february  remoxy tm successfully completed a special protocol assessment with the fda 
as a result  we  along with pain therapeutics  commenced a pivotal phase iii clinical trial with remoxy tm in patients with severe chronic pain 
the remoxy tm formulation consists of a sticky  high viscosity mass that is not prone to injection or inhalation 
it is intended to meet the needs of physicians who appropriately prescribe opioid painkillers and who seek to minimize risks of drug diversion  abuse or accidental patient misuse 
published data show that freezing  crushing  or submerging remoxy tm in high proof alcohol for hours at a time releases just a fraction of oxycodone compared to currently available formulations of oxycodone at time points when abusers presumably expect to be able to abuse its active ingredient 
our phase iii products also include binodenoson  a pharmacologic cardiac stress imaging agent intended to provide a reduced side effects profile compared to the currently approved product adenoscan  vanquix tm  our diazepam filled auto injector that is currently under development as the only therapy of its kind for the treatment of acute  repetitive epileptic seizures  and an altace diuretic combination product for the treatment of hypertension 
we expect to file an nda with the fda for our altace diuretic combination product in the second half of our phase ii compounds are led by bremelanotide  under our collaborative agreement with palatin technologies 
bremelanotide is the first compound in a new drug class called melanocortin receptor agonists under development to treat sexual dysfunction in both men and women 
in november  we announced results from phase ii clinical trials evaluating bremelanotide in men experiencing erectile dysfunction ed 
we are continuing to evaluate data from these completed phase ii trials in men experiencing ed as we prepare for an end of phase ii meeting with the fda in also in  we announced results from a phase iia clinical trial and initiated a phase iib clinical trial evaluating the effects of bremelanotide in women experiencing female sexual dysfunction fsd 
in january  we initiated the phase ii clinical program for mre  an adenosine aa receptor agonist for the topical treatment of chronic  neuropathic  diabetic foot ulcers 
during we also completed the phase i clinical program for t  an adenosine a allosteric enhancer that we are developing for the treatment of neuropathic pain 
we expect to begin the phase ii clinical program for t in the first half of

these increases in gross sales were partially offset by a decline in prescriptions of certain of our branded pharmaceutical products during gross sales were higher in compared to primarily due to the effect of higher unit sales as a result of the effect of a higher level of wholesale inventory reductions of some of our branded pharmaceutical products during  and price increases  particularly with respect to thrombin jmi 
in april we entered into inventory management agreements imas with each of our three key wholesale customers covering all of our branded products for the purpose of obtaining data regarding and 
table of contents reducing the level of wholesale inventories of our products 
as we anticipated  entering into the imas adversely affected net sales of some of our branded pharmaceutical products  particularly during  as wholesale inventory levels of these products were aggressively reduced 
during the fourth quarter of  we amended our imas with our key wholesale customers with the objective of further reducing their inventories of our products 
as a result  the average wholesale inventory level of our key products was further reduced during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of based on inventory data provided by our key customers under the imas  we believe that wholesale inventory levels of our key products  altace  skelaxin  thrombin jmi  sonata and levoxyl  as of december   are at or below normalized levels 
we estimate that the wholesale and retail inventories of our products as of december  represent gross sales of approximately million to million 
the following tables provide the activity and ending balances for our significant gross to net categories accrual for rebates  including administrative fees in thousands balance at january  net of prepaid amounts current provision related to sales made in current period current provision related to sales made in prior periods rebates paid balance at december  net of prepaid amounts rebates include commercial rebates and medicaid and medicare rebates 
medicaid rebate expense was lower in than in primarily due to the federal government shifting persons who were covered by the medicaid program to the medicare part d program 
during january  the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act became effective 
this law provides outpatient prescription drug coverage to senior citizens and certain disabled citizens in the united states 
we have contracts with organizations that administer the medicare part d program  which require us to pay rebates based on contractual pricing and actual utilization under the plans 
during the third quarter of  we began reporting to the centers for medicare and medicaid services using a refined calculation to compute our average manufacturer s price amp and best price 
in addition  during the third quarter of  we recalculated rebates due with respect to prior quarters utilizing the refined amp and best price calculations 
as a result of this updated information  during the third quarter of  we decreased our reserve for estimated medicaid and other government pricing program obligations and increased net sales from branded pharmaceutical products by approximately million  approximately million of which related to years prior to this does not include the adjustment to sales classified as discontinued operations 
as a result of the increase in net sales  the co promotion expense related to net sales of altace increased by approximately million  approximately million of which related to years prior to the effect of this change in estimate on operating income was  therefore  approximately million  approximately million of which related to years prior to during the third quarter of  we reduced our medicaid rebate expense and increased net sales from branded pharmaceutical products by approximately million due to the determination that a liability established in for a government pricing program for military dependents and retirees was no longer probable 
during the first quarter of  we paid approximately million related to i the settlement agreements with the office of inspector general of the united states department of health and human services hhs oig and the department of veterans affairs  to resolve the governmental investigations related to our underpayment of rebates owed to medicaid and other governmental pricing programs during the period from to and ii similar state settlement agreements

table of contents settlement  please see settlement of governmental pricing investigation included in note  commitments and contingencies  in part iv item a  exhibits and financial statement schedules 
of the million paid in the first quarter of  approximately million reduced the rebate accrual and is reflected in rebates paid in the table above 
in addition  during the first quarter of  we reduced our regular periodic medicaid rebate payments as a result of prior overpayments 
during the second quarter of  we began reducing our payments for medicaid rebates to utilize overpayments made to the government related to medicaid during the government pricing investigation in  and during the period of the investigation  we made actual medicaid payments in excess of estimated expense to avoid any underpayments to the government 
as a result of refining the amp and best price calculations in the third quarter of  we discontinued the practice of making payments in excess of the amounts expensed 
we expect to recover the remaining overpayments to the government and will continue to reduce cash payments in the future until this overpayment is fully recovered 
for a discussion regarding this investigation  please see note  commitments and contingencies  in part iv  item a  exhibits and financial statement schedules 
in  the utilization of overpayments reduced our rebate payments by approximately million and has therefore reduced rebates paid in the table above 
accrual for returns in thousands balance at january current provision actual returns ending balance at december our calculation for returns reserves is based on historical sales and return rates over the period during which customers have a right of return 
we also consider current wholesale and retail inventory levels of our products 
based on data received from our inventory management agreements with our three key wholesale customers  there was a significant reduction of wholesale inventory levels of our products during the first quarter of this reduction resulted in a change in estimate during the first quarter of that decreased the reserve for returns by approximately million and increased net sales from branded pharmaceuticals  excluding the adjustment to sales classified as discontinued operations  by the same amount 
during the second quarter of  we decreased our reserve for returns by approximately million and increased our net sales from branded pharmaceuticals  excluding the adjustment for sales classified as discontinued operations  by the same amount as a result of an additional reduction in wholesale inventory levels of our branded products 
these adjustments are reflected in the table above as a reduction in the current provision 
during the third quarter of  our actual returns of branded pharmaceutical products continued to decrease significantly compared to actual returns during the quarterly periods in and the first quarter of additionally  based on data received pursuant to our inventory management agreements with key wholesale customers  we continued to experience normalized wholesale inventory levels of our branded pharmaceutical products during the third quarter of accordingly  we believed that the rate of returns experienced during the second and third quarters of was more indicative of what we expected in future quarters and adjusted our returns reserve accordingly 
this change in estimate resulted in a decrease of approximately million in the returns reserve in the third quarter of and a corresponding increase in net sales from branded pharmaceutical products 
as a result of this increase in net sales  the co promotion expense related to net sales of altace increased by approximately million 
the effect of the change in estimate on operating income was  therefore  approximately million 
as a result of the actual returns during the first quarter of  the estimated rate of returns used in the calculation of our returns reserve for some of our products continued to decrease 
during the first quarter of 
table of contents  we decreased our reserve for returns by approximately million and increased our net sales from branded pharmaceuticals  excluding the adjustment to sales classified as discontinued operations  by the same amount 
the accrual for returns table above reflects this adjustment as a reduction in the current provision 
as a result of this increase in net sales  the co promotion expense related to net sales of altace in the first quarter of increased by approximately million and royalty expense related to net sales of skelaxin increased by approximately million 
the effect of the change in estimate on first quarter operating income was  therefore  approximately million

these two items were partially offset by the cost of revenues associated with higher unit sales of branded prescription products in special items are those particular material income or expense items that our management believes are not related to our ongoing  underlying business  are not recurring  or are not generally predictable 
these items include  but are not limited to  merger and restructuring expenses  non capitalized expenses associated with acquisitions  such as in process research and development charges and one time inventory valuation adjustment charges  charges resulting from the early extinguishments of debt  asset impairment charges  expenses of drug recalls  and gains and losses resulting from the divestiture of assets 
we believe the identification of special items enhances an analysis of our ongoing  underlying business and an analysis of our financial results when comparing those results to that of a previous or subsequent like period 
however  it should be noted that the determination of whether to classify an item as a special item involves judgments by us 
special items affecting cost of revenues from branded pharmaceuticals during  and included the following we recorded a charge in in the amount of million for our purchase commitments for some of our smaller products for which commitments exceeded expected demand 
with the termination of some of these purchase commitment contracts in  we had a benefit of approximately million which reduced our cost of revenues from branded pharmaceutical product 
we incurred a charge of million in primarily related to the voluntary recall of certain lots of levoxyl

table of contents research and development expense for the years ended change december  in thousands research and development research and development in process upon acquisition total research and development research and development represents expenses associated with the ongoing development of investigational drugs and product life cycle management projects in our research and development pipeline 
these expenses have continued to increase over time as our development programs have progressed to later stages of clinical development  which later stages are much more expensive than earlier stages  and as we have continued to add late stage products in development to our portfolio 
our business model continues to focus on adding to our research and development pipeline through the acquisition of novel branded pharmaceutical products and technologies in later stages of development 
accordingly  we anticipate this category of expense to increase in but not at the rate experienced in research and development in process upon acquisition represents the actual cost of acquiring rights to novel branded pharmaceutical projects in development from third parties  which costs we expense at the time of acquisition 
we classify these costs as special items and in   and included the following a charge equaling million during for our acquisition of in process research and development associated with our collaboration with arrow to commercialize one or more novel formulations of ramipril  the active ingredient in our altace product 
under a series of agreements  arrow has granted us rights to certain current and future ndas regarding novel formulations of ramipril and intellectual property  including patent rights and technology licenses relating to these novel formulations 
arrow will have responsibility for the manufacture and supply of new formulations of ramipril for us 
however  under certain conditions  we may manufacture and supply the formulations of ramipril instead of arrow 
arrow will earn fees for the manufacture and supply of the new formulations of ramipril 
arrow filed an nda for a novel formulation of ramipril in january at the time of our acquisition of this project  its success was dependent on additional development activities and fda approval 
the estimated cost to complete the project at the execution of these agreements was approximately million 
the fda approved the nda on february  we expect to be in a position to launch the new formulation during the fourth quarter of or the first quarter of a charge equaling million during for our acquisition of in process research and development associated with our strategic alliance with pain therapeutics to develop and commercialize remoxy tm and other abuse deterrent opiod painkillers 
remoxy tm is an investigational drug in late stage clinical development by pain therapeutics for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain 
we are responsible for all research and development expenses related to this alliance  which could total million 
the value of the in process research and development project was expensed on the date of acquisition as it had not received regulatory approval and had no alternative future use 
remoxy tm is in phase iii of clinical development 
if phase iii clinical development is successful  we currently anticipate obtaining fda approval in we believe there is a reasonable probability of completing the project successfully

overall production volume at this facility declined in recent years 
we are currently transferring to this facility the manufacture of certain products that are currently manufactured by us at other facilities or for us by third parties 
these transfers should increase production and cash flow at the rochester facility 
we currently believe that the long term assets associated with the rochester facility are not impaired based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
however  if production volumes decline further or if we are not successful in transferring additional production to the rochester facility  we may have to write off a portion of the property  plant  equipment associated with this facility

management currently believes that the long term assets associated with these facilities are not impaired based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows

critical accounting policies and estimates we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position  and apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates for which it is reasonably possible that a material change in estimate could occur in the near term include forecasted future cash flows used in testing for impairments of intangible and tangible assets and loss accruals for excess inventory and fixed purchase commitments under our supply contracts 
forecasted future cash flows in particular require considerable judgment and are subject to inherent imprecision 
in the case of impairment testing  changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a material impairment charge and  whether they result in an immediate impairment charge  could result prospectively in a 
table of contents reduction in the estimated remaining useful life of tangible or intangible assets  which could be material to the financial statements 
other significant estimates include accruals for medicaid and other rebates  returns and chargebacks  allowances for doubtful accounts and estimates used in applying the revenue recognition policy and accounting for the amended and restated co promotion agreement with wyeth 
we are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from the related estimates  and our estimates may change from time to time in response to actual developments and new information 
the significant accounting estimates that we believe are important to aid in fully understanding our reported financial results include the following intangible assets  goodwill  and other long lived assets 
when we acquire product rights in conjunction with either business or asset acquisitions  we allocate an appropriate portion of the purchase price to intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets 
the purchase price is allocated to product rights and trademarks  patents  acquired research and development  if any  and other intangibles using the assistance of valuation consultants 
we estimate the useful lives of the assets by factoring in the characteristics of the products such as patent protection  competition by products prescribed for similar indications  estimated future introductions of competing products  and other issues 
the factors that drive the estimate of the life of the asset are inherently uncertain 
however  patents have specific legal lives over which they are amortized 
conversely  trademarks and product rights have no specific legal lives 
trademarks and product rights will continue to be an asset to us after the expiration of the patent  as their economic value is not tied exclusively to the patent 
we believe that by establishing separate lives for the patent versus the trademark and product rights  we are in essence using an accelerated method of amortization for the product as a whole 
this results in greater amortization in earlier years when the product is under patent protection  as we are amortizing both the patent and the trademark and product rights  and less amortization when the product faces potential generic competition  as the amortization on the patent is eliminated 
because we have no discernible evidence to show a decline in cash flows for trademarks and product rights  or for patents  we use the straight line method of amortization for both intangibles 
we review our property  plant and equipment and intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we review our goodwill for possible impairment annually  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in any event  we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
this evaluation is performed through our quarterly evaluation of intangibles for impairment 
further  on an annual basis  we review the life of each intangible asset and make adjustments as deemed appropriate 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  we estimate the fair value of our individual business reporting units on a discounted cash flow basis 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
such assumptions include projections of future cash flows and  in some cases  the current fair value of the asset 
in addition  our depreciation and amortization policies reflect judgments on the estimated useful lives of assets 
we may incur impairment charges in the future if prescriptions for  or sales of  our products are less than current expectations and result in a reduction of our estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
this may be caused by many factors  including competition from generic substitutes  significant delays in the manufacture or supply of materials  the publication of negative results of studies or clinical trials  new legislation or regulatory proposals

our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
we evaluate our entire inventory for short dated or slow moving product and inventory commitments under supply agreements based on projections of future demand and market conditions 
for those units in inventory that are so identified  we estimate their market value or net sales value based on current realization trends 
if the projected net realizable value is less than cost  on a product basis  we make a provision to reflect the lower value of that inventory 
this methodology recognizes projected inventory losses at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold 
we maintain supply agreements with some of our vendors which contain minimum purchase requirements 
we estimate future inventory requirements based on current facts and trends 
should our minimum purchase requirements under supply agreements or if our estimated future inventory requirements exceed actual inventory quantities that we will be able to sell to our customers  we record a charge in costs of revenues 
accruals for rebates  returns  and chargebacks 
we establish accruals for returns  chargebacks  medicaid  medicare  and commercial rebates in the same period we recognize the related sales 
the accruals reduce revenues and are included in accrued expenses 
at the time a rebate or chargeback payment is made or a product return is received  which occurs with a delay after the related sale  we record a reduction to accrued expenses and  at the end of each quarter  adjust accrued expenses for differences between estimated and actual payments 
due to estimates and assumptions inherent in determining the amount of returns  chargebacks and rebates  the actual amount of product returns and claims for chargebacks and rebates may be different from our estimates 
our product returns accrual is primarily based on estimates of future product returns over the period during which customers have a right of return which is in turn based in part on estimates of the remaining shelf life of our products when sold to customers 
future product returns are estimated primarily on historical sales and return rates 
we also consider the level of inventory of our products in the distribution channel 
we base our estimate of our medicaid rebate  medicare rebate and commercial rebate accruals on estimates of usage by rebate eligible customers  estimates of the level of inventory of our products in the distribution channel that remain potentially subject to those rebates  and the terms of our commercial and regulatory rebate obligations 
we base our estimate of our chargeback accrual on our estimates of the level of inventory of our products in the distribution channel that remain subject to chargebacks  and specific contractual and historical chargeback rates 
the estimate of the level of our products in the distribution channel is based on data provided by our three key wholesalers under inventory management agreements 
our accruals for returns  chargebacks and rebates are adjusted as appropriate for specific known developments that may result in a change in our product returns or our rebate and chargeback obligations 
in the case of product returns  we monitor demand levels for our products and the effects of the introduction of competing products and other factors on this demand 
when we identify decreases in demand for products or experience higher than historical rates of returns caused by unexpected discrete events  we further analyze these products for potential additional supplemental reserves 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss are transferred to customers  collection of sales is reasonably assured  and we have no further performance obligations 
this is generally at the time products are received by the customer 
accruals for estimated returns  rebates and 
table of contents chargebacks  determined based on historical experience  reduce revenues at the time of sale and are included in accrued expenses 
medicaid and certain other governmental pricing programs involve particularly difficult interpretations of relevant statutes and regulatory guidance  which are complex and  in certain respects  ambiguous 
moreover  prevailing interpretations of these statutes and guidance can change over time 
royalty revenue is recognized based on a percentage of sales namely  contractually agreed upon royalty rates reported by third parties

recently issued accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are in the process of evaluating the effect of sfas no 
on our financial statements and are planning to adopt this standard in the first quarter of in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions by prescribing a recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the effect of fin on our financial statements and currently plan to adopt this interpretation in the first quarter of we believe the adoption of fin will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
sfas no 
requires certain production overhead costs to be allocated to inventory based upon the normal capacity of the manufacturing facility 
when our manufacturing facilities are operating below their normal capacity  unfavorable variances cannot be allocated to inventory and must be expensed in the period in which they are incurred 
normal capacity is not defined as full capacity by sfas no 
sfas no 
instead provides that normal capacity refers to a range of production levels expected to be achieved over a number of periods or seasons under normal circumstances 
as of december   we estimate capacity utilization was approximately at the rochester  michigan facility  approximately at the bristol  tennessee facility  approximately at the st 
petersburg  florida facility  approximately at the st 
louis  missouri facility and approximately at the middleton  wisconsin facility 
we believe all of our operating facilities  except for the rochester  michigan facility  are currently operating at levels considered to be normal capacity as defined by sfas no 
as these plants have operated at their current levels for a number of periods and are expected to continue to operate within a range of this normal capacity in the foreseeable future 
the margins provided by branded pharmaceutical products are such that they allow manufacturers to operate facilities at lower volumes  or at volumes below theoretical capacity 
additionally  lower capacity levels at certain facilities are  at times  due to the complexity and high regulatory standards associated with the pharmaceutical manufacturing process 
with respect to our bristol  tennessee facility  we anticipate no abnormally higher or lower production levels in the current year and  therefore  have concluded that the projected level of production is within a range of normal capacity and the margins on the branded pharmaceutical products produced at this facility will result in an adequate return on our investment 
consequently  we believe that it is appropriate to use the expected production level to allocate fixed production overhead 
the rochester facility is currently operating at a level below normal capacity primarily due to a decline in contract manufacturing in recent years 
the company owned products manufactured at this facility are not among our higher margin products 
in  we began expensing  and continue to expense  a portion of the fixed overhead costs of this facility as period costs in accordance with accounting research bulletin no 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
 as of january   did not have an incremental effect on our financial statements

generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
in addition  the fair value of our convertible debentures is affected by our stock price 
the estimated fair value of our total long term debt at december  was million 
fair values were determined from available market prices  using current interest rates and terms to maturity 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease  the fair value of our long term debt would increase or decrease by approximately million
