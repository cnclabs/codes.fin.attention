item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
historical results and percentage relationships among accounts are not necessarily an indication of trends in operating results for any future period 
in these discussions  most percentages and dollar amounts have been rounded to aid presentation 
as a result  all such figures are approximations 
executive overview our performance continues to steadily improve as a result of our decisions to focus on the construction markets of nevada  southern utah and arizona which have historically been more profitable for us  be selective in the projects we choose to bid  provide incentives and reward outstanding project management  concentrate our efforts to prevail in our past construction claims and eliminate distractions from lingering claims as well as to avoid future claims  gradually increase our bonding capacity in order to bid on larger single projects and increase our contract backlog to levels that provide more sustainable momentum  and implement expansion plans for our materials segment and focus marketing efforts on non residential market sector 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated for the years ended december  dollars in thousands revenue construction services construction materials construction materials testing total revenue gross profit general and administrative expenses income from operations interest income interest expense other income income tax expense minority interest in consolidated subsidiary net income depreciation and amortization year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue and backlog 
consolidated revenue improved to million for the year ended december   as further referred to as  from million for the year ended december   as further referred to as the improved revenue resulted from a million increase  net of inter company sales  from the cms  offset by a decrease in revenue from the css of million 
the cms increase in revenue resulted from a increase in the average unit sales price in from  complemented by an increase in sales of cubic yards of concrete which we refer to as units 
backlog in the css increased to million compared to million a year ago 
the beginning backlog in the css contributed to the decreased revenue in  based on the progress schedules and nature of the contracts contained in the backlog at the beginning of because so much of our business stems from competitively bid public works  backlog will fluctuate depending upon the amount and type of contracts that we bid on and win 
bid bonds provided by our surety company are required on most of the contracts that we bid  therefore  any restrictions or limitations in the extension of surety credit can impact the amount and type of contracts available to be bid by our css 
surety credit limits and conditions may improve as our financial performance improves  but there can be no assurance that surety credit will be increased 
gross profit 
consolidated gross profit increased to million for from million for and consolidated gross margin  as a percent of revenue  increased to in from in gross profit from css increased to million in from million in and the gross profit margin increased to from in the respective periods

gross profit from the cms increased to million in from million in and the gross profit margin increased to from in the respective periods 
the increases in gross profit and gross profit margin during resulted primarily from the expansion of the cms operation and utilizing new equipment placed in service 
during we anticipate under utilizing new equipment recently placed in service  but long term margins will benefit from our expansion efforts 
the cms fixed costs will increase in 
table of contents as a result of our expansion efforts and could impact the cms gross profit margins in the interim as we bring this equipment up to full utilization

in  no additional loss was required to be recognized on the gooseberry project 
the total anticipated loss on the project is approximately million 
in august  we received a notice of substantial completion from the owner on the gooseberry project 
we have submitted to the owner the necessary 
table of contents documentation to support our claims of changed conditions  associated delays and renegotiable unit prices due to quantity changes and interference 
gross profit margins are affected by a variety of factors including  the quality and accuracy of the initial estimate  construction delays and difficulties due to weather or other conditions  availability of materials  the timing of work performed by other subcontractors and the physical and geological condition of the construction site

net income 
net income was million for as compared to net income of million for the increase in net income was the result of the improved gross profit  as discussed above  compared to where significant losses on the gooseberry project were recognized 
liquidity and capital resources our primary need for capital will be to maximize our working capital to continually improve our bonding limits see bonding and insurance in item  herein 
rmi no longer guarantees any meadow valley debt  however  rmi has indemnified meadow valley payment and performance bonds that were pre existing prior to september and the initial public offering of rmi 
as of december   meadow valley had approximately million of payment and performance bonds indemnified by rmi 
certain guarantees also remain where meadow valley corporation continues to maintain for the benefit of rmi 
we expect  but cannot assure  that eventually there will be no guarantees between the two related companies 
as we expand our businesses we will continue to utilize the availability of capital offered by financial institutions  in turn increasing our total debt and debt service obligations 
historically  our primary source of cash has been from operations and financial institutions 
we believe our historical sources of capital will be satisfactory to meet our needs for the coming year 
during december  we entered into new credit facilities with cit construction  which provides mvci a million revolving credit facility and a million capital expenditure commitment  and rmi a million 
table of contents revolving credit facility as well as a million capital expenditure commitment 
the new cit credit facilities are collateralized by each of our subsidiary s assets as well as our guarantee 
under the terms of the agreements  meadow valley is required to maintain a certain level of tangible net worth as well as maintain a ratio of total debt to tangible net worth  and earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
meadow valley  mvci and rmi are also required to maintain a ratio of cash flow to current portion of long term debt 
as of december   we were compliant with the covenants 
the following table sets forth  for the periods presented  certain items from our statements of cash flows 
for the years ended december  cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities cash provided by operating activities during of million represents a million increase from the amount provided by operating activities during the change was primarily due to an increase in the collection of million of claims receivable collected in  a net increase in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings and a net reduction of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts of million and the year to year change in minority interest in consolidated subsidiary  share based compensation expense and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
cash used in investing activities during of million represents a million increase from the amount used in investing activities during the change was primarily due to a million increase in the purchase of property and equipment  offset by an increase in proceeds received from payments on note receivable  proceeds received from the sale of property and equipment and a decrease in restricted cash 
cash provided by financing activities during of million represents a million decrease from the amount provided by financing activities during the change was primarily due to the net proceeds received from the initial public offering of rmi of million  offset by the increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock in cash provided by operating activities during of million represents a million decrease from the amount provided by operating activities during the change was primarily due to a decrease in the collection of million of claims receivable collected in and an increase in disbursements in of million in accounts payable when compared to cash used in investing activities during of million represents a million increase from the amount used in investing activities during the change was primarily due to a million increase in the purchase of property and equipment  a million decrease in proceeds received from the sale of property and equipment and a million decrease in restricted cash 
cash provided by financing activities during of million represents a million increase from the amount used in financing activities during the change was primarily due to a million increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock  a million increase in proceeds from minority interest in consolidated subsidiary net of offering costs  a million decrease in repayment of capital lease obligations  a million decrease in proceeds received from notes payable and a million increase in repayment of notes payable 
impact of inflation there have been increases in the cost of our raw materials and the transport of those materials  however  we have been able to effectively pass these additional costs on to our customers 
therefore  we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our operations 
however  additional substantial increases in labor costs  worker compensation rates and employee benefits  equipment costs  material or subcontractor costs could adversely affect our operations in future periods 
furthermore  increased interest rates typically track rising inflation 
to the extent 
table of contents that rising interest rates equate to higher home mortgage rates  which have an impact on construction activity  a material rise in the inflation rate could cause a decline in residential or commercial construction and a negative impact on our business 
summary of contractual obligations and commercial commitments contractual obligations at december   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods  are summarized as follows payments due by period less than after dollars in thousands total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt interest payments on long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations interest payments are based on the individual interest rates of each obligation  which range from to per annum 
we do not assume an increase in the variable interest rate 
see note notes payable and note lines of credit in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item other long term liabilities include employment contracts with officers and key employees that call for annual salaries ranging from  to  through october  and are to be reviewed annually by our compensation committee 
known and anticipated future trends and contingencies our cms has shown steady growth since its inception and we plan to continue to exploit opportunities within that segment of our business 
the initial public offering completed in for a portion of rmi was to raise capital for such purposes 
the key dynamics of employment and population growth within our geographic markets appear to present the cms with continued growth opportunities 
it appears that demand for construction materials will remain steady and that the supply of raw materials will remain relatively limited  thereby likely maintaining stable prices  or  if costs rise  a possibility of further price increases 
we have exited the construction services market in new mexico and utah  however  we may occasionally perform work in southern utah that we believe can be effectively managed from our full time office in las vegas and we still maintain a small sand and gravel operation in nephi  utah 
in spite of having physically exited these markets  we continue to expend resources dealing with two new mexico projects with unresolved claims and we have finalized a claim that we submitted to the federal highway administration on the gooseberry project that was completed in we believe we have conservatively booked claim revenue on the new mexico projects and the gooseberry project 
therefore  in the future  we believe we may be able to recover at least what we have booked to date  if not more 
if the css can continue to demonstrate operating improvements  then as profitability  working capital and liquidity increase  our surety credit will likely increase  thereby allowing us to bid on and perform more and larger projects 
bidding opportunities within our focused market areas of nevada and arizona are ample for the size of our current surety program and we believe  given historical bidding success  that the backlog may increase during 
table of contents as public works constitute the majority of our css volume  and governmental entities are the primary source of funding for infrastructure work  it is  therefore  important that public funding be maintained 
the national transportation legislation  safetea lu  was signed by president bush on august  and should provide relatively stable funding for transportation infrastructure at least until its expiration in the fall of the competitive bidding process will continue to be the dominant method for determining contract awards 
however  other innovative bidding methods will be tried and may gain favor  namely a plus b contracts  where the bidders proposals are selected on both price and scheduling criteria 
design build projects and construction manager at risk projects are becoming more common and are likely to increase in frequency 
we recently won our first design build project 
the contract is valued at approximately 
million  but we believe it represents a low risk opportunity to enter this venue of work 
in light of the rising need for infrastructure work throughout the nation and the tendency of the current need to out pace the supply of funds  it is anticipated that alternative funding sources will continue to be sought 
funding for infrastructure development in the united states is coming from a growing variety of innovative sources 
an increase of funding measures is being undertaken by various levels of government to help solve traffic congestion and related air quality problems 
sales taxes  fuel taxes  user fees in a variety of forms  vehicle license taxes  private toll roads and quasi public toll roads are examples of how transportation funding is evolving 
transportation norms are being challenged by federally mandated air quality standards 
improving traffic movement  eliminating congestion  increasing public transit  adding or designating high occupancy vehicle hov lanes to encourage car pooling and other solutions are being considered in order to help meet epa imposed air quality standards 
there is also a trend toward local and state legislation regulating growth and urban sprawl 
the passage of such legislation and the degree of growth limits imposed by it could dramatically affect the nature of our markets 
in november  voters in maricopa county phoenix  arizona metropolitan area passed a measure to extend  for twenty years  a half cent sales tax dedicated to the construction and maintenance of transportation facilities  including freeways  streets and mass transit 
it is expected that this measure will generate approximately billion of funding over a twenty year span 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described below and in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies are the revenue recognition and cost estimation on certain contracts for which we use a percentage of completion accounting method  our allowance for doubtful accounts and the allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory 
the revenue recognition and cost estimation accounting method is applied by the css to heavy construction projects executed under multi year contracts with various customers 
approximately  and of total net revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting during  and  respectively 
revenue and cost recognition revenues and costs from fixed price and modified fixed price construction contracts are recognized for each contract on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to the estimated total of direct costs 
direct costs include  among other things  direct labor  field labor  equipment rent  subcontracting  direct materials  and direct overhead 
general and administrative expenses are accounted for as period costs and are  therefore  not included in the calculation of the estimates to complete construction contracts in progress 
project losses are provided for in their entirety in the period in which such losses are determined  without reference to the percentage of completion 
as contracts can extend over one or more accounting periods  revisions 
table of contents in costs and earnings estimated during the course of the work are reflected during the accounting period in which the facts that required such revisions become known 
the asset costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represents revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed 
the liability billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of revenue recognized 
the complexity of the estimation process and all issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affects the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors affect our percentage of completion estimates  including labor rate and efficiency variances  estimated future material prices and customer specification changes 
if our business conditions were different  or if we used different assumptions in the application of this accounting policy  it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported in our consolidated financial statements 
collectibility of accounts receivable we are also required to estimate the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer and the related aging of the past due balances 
our provision for bad debts as of december  and amounted to  and  respectively 
we determine our reserve by using percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories and percentages of certain types of revenue generated  as well as a review of the individual accounts outstanding and our collection history 
inventory  net we are required to state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to the future demand requirements and compare these with the current inventory levels 
our reserve requirements generally increase as our projected demand requirements decrease due to market conditions and longer than expected usage periods 
at december  and  inventories of  and  respectively  are net of reserves of  and  respectively 
it is possible that significant changes in required inventory reserves may continue to occur in the future if there is a further decline in market conditions or market activity 
valuation of property and equipment we are required to provide property and equipment net of depreciation and amortization expense 
we expense depreciation and amortization utilizing the straight line method  over what we believe to be the estimated useful lives 
leasehold improvements are amortized over their estimated useful lives or the lease term  whichever is shorter 
the estimated useful lives of property and equipment are plants years computer equipment years equipment years leasehold improvements years office furniture and equipment years vehicles years office building years the life on any piece of equipment can vary  even within the same category of equipment  due to the quality of the maintenance  care provided by the operator and the general environmental conditions  such as temperature  rain and the terrain conditions to reach the job site where the material is delivered 
we maintain  service and repair approximately of our equipment through the use of our mechanics 
if we inaccurately estimate the life of any given piece of equipment or category of equipment we may be overstating or understating earnings in any given period 
we also review our property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is 
table of contents measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the impairments are recognized in the period during which they are identified 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we must calculate the blended tax rate  combining all applicable tax jurisdictions  which can vary over time as a result of the allocation of taxable income between the tax jurisdictions and the changes in tax rates 
we must also assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets  if any  will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent recovery is not likely  must establish a valuation allowance 
this assessment is complicated by the fact that we are required to consolidate our subsidiaries for financial reporting purposes  while being separately reported for tax purposes 
furthermore  we are subject to periodic review by domestic tax authorities for audit of our income tax returns 
these audits generally include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the amount and timing of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  including federal and state taxes  we believe we have complied with the rules of the service codes and therefore have not recorded reserves for any possible exposure 
typically the taxing authorities can audit the previous three years of tax returns and in certain situations audit additional years  therefore a significant amount of time may pass before an audit is conducted and fully resolved 
although no audits are currently being conducted  if a taxing authority would require us to amend a prior year s tax return we would record the increase or decrease in our tax obligation in the year in which it is more likely than not to be realized 
classification of leases we follow the standards established by statements of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases  which we will refer to as fas one factor when determining if a lease is an operating lease or a capital lease is the intention from the inception of the lease regarding the final ownership  or transfer of title  of the asset to be leased 
we are currently leasing ready mix trucks under operating lease agreements  since at the inception of those leases we had not intended to take title to those vehicles at the conclusion of the leases 
therefore  we did not request transfer of ownership provisions at the conclusion of the leases such as bargain purchase options or direct transfers of ownership 
since we do not intend to take ownership at the conclusion of the leases and we do not meet the remaining criteria of fas for capitalization  the leases are classified as operating leases 
if we would have desired at the inception of the leases to have the ownership transfer at the conclusion of the leases  we would have classified those leases as capital leases and would have recorded the ready mix trucks as assets on our balance sheet as well as recording the liability as capital lease obligations 
we believe that the lease expense under the operating lease classification approximates the depreciation expense which would have been incurred if the leases would have been classified as capital leases 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the sec issued sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  to address diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements 
sab no 
requires that we quantify misstatements based on their impact on each of our financial statements and related disclosures 
sab no 
is effective as of the end of the fiscal year  allowing a one time transitional cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of january  for errors that were not previously deemed material  but are material under the guidance in sab no 
the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit and retiree medical plans as an asset or liability in the company s year end balance sheet  with changes in the funded status recognized 
table of contents through comprehensive income in the year in which they occur 
sfas no 
also requires us to measure the funded status of defined benefit and retiree medical plans as of our year end balance sheet date no later than we do not expect sfas no 
will have a material effect on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect sfas no 
will have a material effect on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin no 
reflects the benefit recognition approach  where a tax benefit is recognized when it is more likely than not to be sustained based on the technical merits of the position 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect fin no 
will have a material effect on our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fin no 
r  determining the variability to be considered in applying fasb interpretation no 
r  that became effective beginning the third quarter of fsp fin no 
r clarifies that the variability to be considered in applying fasb interpretation r shall be based on an analysis of the design of the variable interest entity 
the adoption of this fsp did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets  which provides an approach to simplify efforts to obtain hedge like offset accounting 
this new statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective for all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year that begins after september   with earlier adoption permitted in certain circumstances 
we do not expect sfas no 
will have a material effect on our financial statements 
the fasb has revised its guidance on sfas no 
implementation issues as of march several implementation issues were revised to reflect the issuance of sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  in february sfas no 
allows any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities to be carried at fair value in its entirety  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that beneficial interests in securitized financial assets be analyzed to determine whether they are freestanding derivatives or contain an embedded derivative 
sfas no 
also eliminates a prior restriction on the types of passive derivatives that a qualifying special purpose entity is permitted to hold 
sfas no 
is applicable to new or modified financial instruments in fiscal years beginning after september   though the provisions related to fair value accounting for hybrid financial instruments can also be applied to existing instruments 
we do not expect sfas no 
will have a material effect on our financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we do not have foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price market risk 
interest rate risk from time to time we temporarily invest our excess cash and restricted cash in interest bearing securities issued by high quality issuers 
we monitor risk exposure to monies invested in securities in our financial institutions 
due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity  these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets and do not represent a material interest rate risk 
our primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to our long term debt obligations 
we manage our exposure to changing interest rates principally through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
we evaluated the potential effect that near term changes in interest rates would have had on the fair value of our interest rate risk sensitive financial instruments at december  assuming a basis point increase in the prime interest rate at december  the potential increase in our debt obligations would have been approximately million at december  see note notes payable and note lines of credit in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item
