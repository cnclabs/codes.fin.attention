item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
title operations products and services title insurance title insurance policies are insured statements of the condition of title to real property 
these policies indemnify the insured from losses resulting from certain outstanding liens  encumbrances and other defects in title to real property that appear as matters of public record  and from certain other matters not of public record 
title insurance is generally accepted as the most efficient means of determining title to  and priority of interests in  real estate in nearly all parts of the united states 
many of the principal customers of title insurance companies buy insurance for the accuracy and reliability of the title search as well as for the indemnity features of the policy 
the beneficiaries of title insurance policies are generally owners or buyers of real property or parties who make loans using real property as security 
an owner s policy protects the named insured against title defects  liens  and encumbrances existing as of the date of the policy and not specifically excluded or excepted from its provisions  while a lender s policy also insures the validity and priority of the lien of the insured mortgage as stated in the title policy 
while most other forms of insurance provide for the assumption of risk of loss arising out of unforeseen future events  title insurance serves to protect the policyholder from the risk of loss from events that predate the issuance of the policy 
this distinction underlies the low claims loss experience of title insurers as compared to other insurance underwriters 
losses generally result either from judgment errors or mistakes made in the title search and examination process or the escrow process or from hidden defects such as fraud  forgery  incapacity  or missing heirs 
title insurers incur considerable operating costs related to the personnel required to process forms  search titles  collect information on specific properties  and prepare title insurance commitments and policies 
we issue title insurance policies primarily through three principal title underwriting subsidiaries commonwealth land title insurance company commonwealth  lawyers title insurance corporation lawyers title  and transnation title insurance company transnation 
during  we acquired an insurance underwriter  united capital title insurance company  which is a subsidiary of capital title 
we also own three other title insurance underwriters commonwealth land title insurance company of new jersey  land title insurance company  and title insurance company of america 
effective december   we merged one of our title insurance underwriters  transnation title insurance company of new york  into commonwealth 
the collective operations of these subsidiaries cover the entire united states with the exception of iowa  which does not recognize title insurance  and certain territories of the united states and canada 
in addition  we offer customers international title policy services in mexico  the caribbean  latin america  europe  and asia 
escrow and closing services in addition to the issuance of title insurance policies  we provide escrow and closing services to a broad based customer group that includes lenders  developers  real estate agents  attorneys  and property buyers and sellers 
in california and a number of other western states  it is a general practice  incidental to the issuance of title insurance policies  to hold funds and documents in escrow for delivery in real estate transactions upon fulfillment of the conditions to such delivery 
in the mid western states  florida and some eastern cities  it is customary for the title company to close the transaction and disburse the sale or loan proceeds 
fees for escrow and closing services are generally separate and distinct from premiums paid for title insurance policies and other real estate related services 
commercial services our commercial services business assists customers in handling the more complex nature of commercial transactions and facilitates the coordination and delivery of products and services 
in addition to title insurance  escrow  and closing services  we provide a range of specialized services that include zoning certification  construction disbursement  coordination of national multi state transactions  tax deferred real property exchanges pursuant to section of the internal revenue code  and uniform commercial code products insuring personal property 
the combined capital position of our three principal title underwriting subsidiaries enables us to underwrite large commercial policies and to participate in multi state transactions 

table of contents operations we issue title insurance policies through branch offices of our title insurance underwriters  wholly owned or partially owned but consolidated subsidiary agencies  or through partially owned or independent title insurance agents 
where the policy is issued through a branch or wholly owned subsidiary agency operation  the search is performed by us or at our direction  and the premiums collected are retained by us 
where the policy is issued through a title insurance agent  whether or not partially owned by us  the agent generally performs the search in some areas searches are performed by attorneys and in some instances agents purchase components of the search from third party companies  examines the title  collects the premium  and retains a majority of the premium 
the agent remits to us the remainder of the premium as compensation  part of which is for bearing the risk of loss in the event a claim is made under the policy 
the percentage of the premium retained by an agent varies from region to region and is sometimes regulated by the states 
we are obligated to pay title claims in accordance with the terms of our policies  regardless of whether we issue policies through direct operations or agents 
we maintain a quality assurance program for our independent agents 
see insured risk on policies in force 
the premium for title insurance is due in full when the real estate transaction is closed 
we recognize title insurance premium revenue from direct operations upon the closing of the transaction  whereas we recognize premium revenue from agency operations upon the reporting of such premiums by the agent 
premiums from agents are typically remitted to us after the closing of the real estate transaction  with the average time between closing and reporting being approximately days for underwriting we issue title insurance policies on the basis of a title report  prepared pursuant to our prescribed underwriting guidelines  generally after a search of the public records  maps and documents to ascertain the existence of easements  restrictions  rights of way  conditions  encumbrances  liens  or other matters affecting the title to  or use of  real property 
in certain instances  a visual inspection of the property is also made 
title examinations may be made by branch employees  agency personnel  or approved attorneys  whose reports are utilized by or rendered to a branch or agent and are the basis for the issuance of policies 
in the case of difficult or unusual legal or underwriting issues involving potential title risks  the branch office or agent is instructed to consult with  and obtain prior approval of  a designated supervising office 
our contracts with independent agents require that the agent seek our prior approval before we assume a risk over a stated dollar limit 
we own a number of title plants and in some areas lease or participate with other title insurance companies or agents in the cooperative operation of such plants 
title plants are compilations of copies of public records  maps  and documents that are indexed to specific properties in an area  and they serve to facilitate the preparation of title reports 
to maintain the value of the title plants  we continually update our records by regularly adding current information from the public records and other sources 
in this way  we maintain the ability to produce quickly  and at a reduced expense  a statement of the instruments that constitute the chain of title to a particular property 
in many of the larger markets  the title plant and search procedures have been automated 
we anticipate that the use of electronic media at courthouses and state and local governments will continue to grow over the next several years which may reduce the value of our title plants in the future 
insured risk on policies in force the amount of the insured risk or face amount of insurance under a title insurance policy is generally equal to either the purchase price of the property or the amount of the loan secured by the property 
the insurer is also responsible for the cost of defending the insured title against covered claims 
the insurer s actual exposure at any time is significantly less than the total face amount of policies in force because the risk on an owner s policy is often reduced over time as a result of subsequent transfers of the property and the reissuance of title insurance by other title insurance underwriters  and the coverage of a lender s policy is reduced and eventually terminated as a result of payment of the mortgage loan 
because of these factors  the total liability of a title underwriter on outstanding policies cannot be precisely ascertained 

table of contents in the ordinary course of business  our underwriting subsidiaries represent and defend the interests of their insureds  and our consolidated financial statements provide for estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses arising from claims 
title insurers are sometimes subject to unusual claims such as claims of indian tribes to land formerly inhabited by them  claims resulting from fraud and defalcation  claims from large classes of claimants  and other claims arising outside the insurance contract  including but not limited to  alleged negligence in search  examination or closing  alleged improper claims handling  alleged bad faith  alleged collection of excess premiums from certain consumers alleged to be entitled to a re issue rate  and alleged improper charges for recording and other fees 
the damages alleged in such claims arising outside the insurance contract may exceed the stated liability limits of the policies involved 
standard poor s s p  a division of the mcgraw hill companies  inc  has assigned a financial strength rating of a to our title insurance operations 
according to s p  an insurer rated a has strong financial security characteristics  but is somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than are insurers with higher ratings  and the minus rating indicates relative standing within the a category 
s p assigns a ratings outlook along with its letter ratings to indicate its expectations of trends that relate to the financial strength rating for the rated company 
the ratings outlook assigned by s p may be either positive  stable  or negative 
according to s p  our ratings outlook is stable 
fitch  inc fitch has assigned an a rating to our financial strength 
according to fitch  an a rating is assigned to those companies that possess strong capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations  where risk factors are moderate and the impact of any adverse business and economic factors is expected to be small 
fitch also assigns a ratings outlook along with its letter ratings to indicate its expectations of trends that relate to the financial strength rating for the rated company 
the ratings outlook assigned by fitch may be either positive  stable  or negative 
according to fitch  our ratings outlook is stable 
the s p and fitch ratings are not designed for the protection of investors and do not constitute recommendations to buy  sell or hold any security 
additionally  both fitch and s p have assigned senior debt ratings to our convertible debentures due in and our convertible debentures have been assigned ratings of bbb 
we believe that we are strongly capitalized with an aggregate statutory equity of million as of december  we place a high priority on maintaining effective quality assurance and claims administration programs 
our quality assurance program focuses on quality control  claims prevention and product risk assessment for our independent agencies 
the claims administration program focuses on improving liability analysis  prompt  fair and effective handling of claims  early evaluation of settlement or litigation with first and third party claimants and appropriate use of adr alternative dispute resolution in claims processing 
in addition  to reduce the incidence of agency defalcations  we established due diligence requirements in connection with the appointment of new agents  procedures for renewing existing agents  and an agency audit program 
we continue to refine our systems for maintaining effective quality assurance and claims administration programs 
facultative reinsurance and coinsurance our title insurance subsidiaries distribute large title insurance risks by entering into facultative reinsurance agreements with other insurance companies the reinsurer 
in facultative reinsurance agreements  the reinsurer assumes a portion of the risk that the primary insurance company the ceding company or ceder decides not to retain in consideration of a premium 
the ceder  however  remains liable to the insured under the policy for the total risk  whether or not the reinsurer meets its obligation 
reinsurance agreements may be entered into with related insurance companies and or with unaffiliated insurance companies 
when facultative reinsurance agreements are entered into  a primary risk generally in the amount of percent of the total risk with a million minimum and a million maximum is retained by the ceder 
we enter into reinsurance arrangements both as the reinsurer and the ceder 
we generally purchase facultative reinsurance from unaffiliated reinsurers based upon our review of the underwriting risks  the retention laws of the state where the property is located and the state where the ceding company is domiciled  and the retention limitations imposed by the customer 
we occasionally utilize coinsurance to enable us to provide coverage in amounts greater than we would be willing or able to undertake individually 
in coinsurance transactions  generally  each individual underwriting company issues a separate policy and assumes a portion of the overall total risk from the first dollar 
each coinsurer is liable only for the particular portion of the risk it assumes 

table of contents our title insurance subsidiaries enter into facultative reinsurance and coinsurance arrangements with most of the larger participants in the title insurance market  and such arrangements are not concentrated with any single title insurance company 
revenue and claims from facultative reinsurance are not material to our business as a whole 
the exposure on assumed reinsurance risks is reduced due to the ceding company s retention of a significant primary risk 
in addition  the exposure under these agreements generally ceases upon a transfer of the property and  with respect to insured loans  is decreased by reductions in mortgage loan balances 
for these reasons  the actual exposure is much less than the total reinsurance our title insurance subsidiaries have assumed 
loss reserves on assumed reinsurance business are maintained on a basis consistent with reserves for direct business 
we maintain excess of loss catastrophic insurance through lloyd s of london totaling million 
the lloyd s of london policy provides fidelity and title loss coverage up to million with a million deductible for title losses and a lesser deductible for other losses 
we have not paid as reinsurer or recovered as ceder any material reinsured losses under a facultative reinsurance agreement during the three year period ended december  title operations revenue the table below sets forth  for the years ended december   and  the approximate title operating revenue and percentages of our total title revenue for the five states representing the largest percentages of such revenue and for all other states and countries combined revenue by state dollars in millions california texas florida new york arizona other total title revenue title operating revenues represented percent  percent and percent of our total consolidated operating revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales and marketing for sales and marketing purposes  we have organized our business into four customer groups residential services  commercial services  lender services  and agency services 
in each of these groups  we continue our transition from title insurance product delivery to being a single source provider of the multiple products and services involved in real estate transactions 
residential services residential transaction services business results from the construction  sale  resale  and refinancing of residential properties 
most of our residential business comes from local attorneys  real estate brokers and developers  financial institutions  mortgage brokers  and independent escrow agents 
therefore  our marketing strategy for the residential business focuses on maintenance and expansion of these local business sources 
in  we continued to focus on customer service  including supporting our superior service guarantee that provides for the refund of the escrow or closing fee when a residential customer is not satisfied with our service 
in  we introduced landamclosing 
com  a web based site for opening and closing orders and the management of 
table of contents documents by our residential customers 
we also developed a new website  knowyourclosing 
com  a consumer education resource that gives consumers answers to commonly asked questions regarding their closings and tells them where to turn for reliable information 
although we serve the residential market through two major distribution channels direct company owned offices and title insurance agents  we only include our owned offices in the residential services group 
commercial services commercial real estate business results from the construction  sale  resale and refinancing of properties with a business or commercial use 
our commercial services group specializes in coordinating  underwriting and closing complex commercial and multi property transactions 
our financial strength is an important factor in marketing our commercial title business capabilities because it enables us to write larger title policies and retain higher levels of risk without purchasing reinsurance from a third party 
we have aligned our local commercial offices with our national commercial offices as part of the implementation of our customer focused strategy initiated in each office provides transaction and support services to national and local commercial accounts 
the transaction and support services benefit both our owned offices as well as independent agents who handle substantial commercial transactions  although we consider business from such independent agents to be part of the agency services business 
commercial services business supports landamerica commercial connection  a web based site for opening and closing orders  and the management of documents by our commercial customers 
as of december   we have personnel providing commercial transaction expertise in offices in geographic markets including four offices outside of the united states located in canada  mexico  germany  and switzerland 
agency services we consider our network of approximately  agents  whom we refer to as our agent partners to be one of our four main customer groups 
we offer a suite of services called agentxtra to provide our agent partners with solutions for their businesses  to improve their relationships with their customers  and to grow their businesses 
lender services while many of our residential services and commercial services offices provide service to local mortgage lenders  we also provide a variety of centralized  nationally coordinated services to lenders and mortgage servicers 
in  we continued to support lenderxtra sm  a flexible approach to product bundling that allows national lenders to create customized service packages that include lenderxtraorder  our online platform that allows real time  instant price quotes and order conversion for bundled lender services 
customers as of december   no single agent was responsible for more than percent of our title insurance revenue 
in addition  our title insurance business is not dependent upon any single customer 
the loss of any independent agent or customer would not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
competition the business of providing real estate transaction services is very competitive 
we compete for residential title insurance business primarily on the quality of service in those states that regulate rates that we can charge for our services  and on price and service in other states that do not regulate rates 
quality of service is based upon a number of factors  including the ability to respond quickly and accurately to customers  and technological capabilities resulting in the delivery of a readily accessible  efficient  and reliable product 
competition for commercial title business is based primarily on service  expertise in complex transactions  the size and financial strength of the insurer  and price  to the extent permitted by rate regulations 
title insurance underwriters also compete for agents on the basis of service and commission levels 
for each of our customer groups  we have increased our emphasis on service levels and the variety of services and products we provide 
our principal competitors are other major title insurance underwriters and their agency networks 
during  our principal competitors were fidelity national financial  inc formerly fidelity national title group  inc  the first american corporation  stewart information services  inc  and old republic international corporation 
while there are approximately title insurance underwriting companies licensed in the united states that generate percent of the industry s underwriting market  the top five companies consisting of us and our four principal competitors and their consolidated subsidiaries accounted for approximately percent of the title insurance underwriting market in  the latest date for which information is available  based on public filings made by those companies 

table of contents our title insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance authorities and enforcement of laws by other governmental authorities of the states in which they do business 
our title insurance subsidiaries are subject to compliance with the real estate settlement procedures act respa on one to four family residential transactions which is primarily enforced by the us department of housing and urban development 
see regulation 
within this regulatory framework  we compete with respect to premium rates  coverage  risk evaluation  service  and business development 
state regulatory authorities impose underwriting limits on title insurers based primarily on levels of available capital and surplus 
we have underwriting limits that are comparable to our four principal competitors 
while such limits may theoretically hinder our title insurance subsidiaries assumption of a particularly large underwriting liability  in practice we have generally established our own internal risk limits at levels substantially lower than those allowed by state law 
in addition  we may spread the risk of a large underwriting liability over our three principal title underwriting subsidiaries 
therefore  we do not consider statutory capital based risk limits to be a significant factor in the amount of underwriting we may undertake 
business strategy our long term objective is to improve our position as a premier provider and manager of integrated real estate transaction services while maximizing our profitability throughout the real estate market cycle 
focusing on the customer we employ a customer focused strategy to strengthen our relationships with our customers 
in conjunction with this strategy  we have leadership positions and teams to support our primary customer groups agency services  lender services  residential services and commercial services 
with the objective of fostering customer loyalty  these leaders and teams are responsible for consistent service quality and operational excellence by providing common support platforms and structures for the various markets in which we operate 
our shared support resources are organized to provide direct support to our customer focused operations 
production and process improvement is a shared resource providing title production services to our teams that support our primary customer groups 
technology resources focuses on providing superior customer service and increasing our operational efficiency through electronic business solutions and technology support 
our other shared resources  such as human resources and legal  provide direct support to our internal customers through dedicated business partners 
expanding title insurance distribution capabilities and broadening real estate transaction services offerings we seek to increase our share of the title insurance market by expanding and enhancing our distribution channels through the hiring and retention of experienced industry professionals with strong local relationships  the opening of new offices in markets with the potential for significant transaction volume  acquisitions of title insurance agencies or underwriters  and selectively engaging in title insurance agency joint ventures in order to strengthen our presence in particularly attractive markets 
in the case of the acquisition of agencies or small to medium size underwriters  we review the agency s or underwriter s profitability  location  growth potential in its existing market  claims experience and  in the case of an underwriter  the adequacy of its reserves 
in  we merged with capital title  a publicly held title insurance company and acquired napa land title  a california underwritten title company 
other acquisitions included a title insurance agency  five home inspection companies  a settlement services company  a flood certification services company  and a home warranty business 
throughout our title customer base  there is demand for providers of multiple  diverse real estate transaction services 
our strategy is to continue to expand our array of real estate transaction products and services available to title customers as well as our distribution channels 
maintaining commercial real estate market strength participation in the commercial real estate market partially offsets some of the cyclicality of the residential real estate market  where transaction volumes are more susceptible to changes in interest rates 
we maintain our presence in the commercial real estate market primarily due to the high quality service that we provide and our expertise in handling complex transactions  the financial strength ratings of our underwriting subsidiaries  and our strong capital position 
in particular  the combined capital position of our three principal underwriting subsidiaries enables us to underwrite large commercial policies while purchasing less facultative reinsurance  thus increasing profitability 

table of contents reducing costs and expenses losses resulting from claims under title insurance policies represent a relatively small part of our overall costs 
operating costs constitute the largest portion of expenses relating to providing title insurance and are relatively high compared to other types of insurers 
we utilize a production unit model in which our three principal title operating subsidiaries share a single back office processing center in a geographic region while continuing to market from separate storefronts under different operating names 
in  we introduced our project fusion initiative to reduce over technology applications to or less applications over the next two years 
our production division is responsible for the delivery of title products to our direct company owned offices and title insurance agents 
we provide escrow support from several centralized locations  thereby increasing service levels and improving efficiency 
we have also implemented out sourcing and off shoring initiatives to streamline operations in areas where it has been determined that these initiatives will be cost efficient  improve customer service  and provide value to our shareholders 
enhancing cost control flexibility we manage our personnel and other operational expenses to reflect changes in the level of activity in the real estate market 
as a result  our employee base expands and contracts over time in response to changes in the real estate market and acquisitions we have made 
however  personnel and administrative costs in the title operations segment do not decrease as rapidly as transaction volumes decrease due to our inability to change headcount in direct correlation to volume changes 
in an effort to manage personnel costs more efficiently throughout the real estate cycle  we use temporary or part time employees where appropriate to staff operations so we can respond more rapidly to changes in real estate activity 
regulation the title insurance business is regulated by state regulatory authorities that possess broad powers relating to the granting and revoking of licenses  and the type and amount of investments which our title insurance subsidiaries may make 
these state authorities also regulate insurance rates  forms of policies  claims handling procedures and the form and content of required annual statements  and have the power to audit and examine financial and other records and the market conduct of these companies 
these and other governmental authorities have the power to enforce state and federal laws to which our title insurance subsidiaries are subject  including but not limited to  state anti rebate and anti kickback statutes and respa 
some states require title insurers to own or lease title plants 
a substantial portion of the assets of our title insurer subsidiaries consists of their portfolios of investment securities 
each of these subsidiaries is required by the laws of its state of domicile to maintain assets of a statutorily defined quality and amount 
see investment policies below 
under state laws  certain levels of capital and surplus must be maintained and certain amounts of portfolio securities must be segregated or deposited with appropriate state officials 
various state statutes require title insurers to defer a portion of all premiums in a reserve for the protection of policyholders and to segregate investments in a corresponding amount 
state regulatory policies also require prior notice to regulators in the event of a dividend or a distribution  and restrict the amount of dividends and distributions that title insurance companies may pay to their shareholders without prior regulatory approval 
generally  all of the title insurers that meet certain financial thresholds are required to engage independent auditors to audit their statutory basis financial statements which  along with the auditor s report  must be filed with the state insurance regulators 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic has adopted model legislation that  if enacted by individual states  would regulate title insurers and agents nationally and would change certain statutory reporting requirements 
the model legislation also would require title insurers to audit agents periodically and require licensed agents to maintain professional liability insurance 
a number of states have adopted legislation similar to some of the provisions contained in the naic model legislation 
we cannot predict whether all or any portion of the proposed legislation or any other legislation further regulating title insurers and agents will be adopted in any other states or federally 
also  the naic has adopted an instruction requiring an annual certification of reserve adequacy by a qualified actuary 
each title insurance subsidiary  unless it qualifies for an exemption  must file an actuarial opinion with respect to the adequacy of its reserves in most states in which they operate 
state insurance regulatory laws intended primarily for the protection of policyholders contain provisions that require advance approval by state agencies of any change in control of an insurance company that is domiciled or  in some 
table of contents cases  merely admitted to do business in that state 
under such current laws  any future transaction that would constitute a change in control would generally require approval by the state insurance departments of california  nebraska  new jersey  tennessee and texas 
such a requirement could have the effect of delaying or preventing certain transactions affecting the control or the ownership of our common stock  including transactions that could be advantageous to our shareholders 
cyclicality and seasonality the title insurance business is closely related to the overall level of residential and commercial real estate activity  which is generally affected by the relative strength or weakness of the united states economy 
in addition  title insurance volumes fluctuate based on changes in interest rates 
periods of increasing interest rates usually have an adverse impact on residential real estate activity and therefore decrease our title insurance premiums and fee revenue 
in contrast  periods of declining interest rates usually have a positive impact on residential real estate activity which increase our title insurance premiums and fee revenue 
commercial real estate volumes are less sensitive to changes in interest rates  but fluctuate based on local supply and demand conditions for space 
the title insurance business tends to be seasonal as well as cyclical 
residential buy sell activity is generally slower in the winter  when fewer families buy or sell homes  with increased volumes in the spring and summer 
residential refinancing activity is generally more uniform throughout the seasons  but is subject to interest rate variability 
we typically report our lowest revenue in the first quarter  with revenue increasing into the second quarter and through the third quarter 
the fourth quarter customarily may be as strong as the third quarter  depending on the level of activity of residential refinancing and of commercial real estate transactions 
environmental matters title insurance policies specifically exclude any liability for environmental risks or contamination 
policies issued before  while not specifically addressing environmental risks  are not considered to provide any coverage for such matters  and we have not experienced and do not expect any significant expenses related to environmental claims 
through our subsidiaries  we sometimes act as a temporary title holder to real estate under a nominee holding agreement and sometimes participate in title holding agreements involving tax deferred exchanges 
our customers in such situations generally are financially strong entities from whom we secure indemnification for potential environmental and other claims 
in other situations where we might acquire title to real estate  we will generally require that an appropriate environmental assessment be made to evaluate and avoid any potential liability 
lender services products and services the lender services segment focuses on mortgage lenders as a distinct customer base for certain of our products and services  which include centralized real estate transaction management services  real estate tax processing services  flood zone determinations  consumer mortgage credit reporting  default management services  and mortgage loan subservicing 
management is organized to focus on the three lines of business provided to our national and regional lender customers mortgage origination  loan servicing  and loan subservicing 
our mortgage origination business provides centralized real estate transaction management services  appraisal services  flood zone determinations and consumer mortgage credit reporting services 
real estate transaction management services landamerica onestop offers to the national and regional mortgage lending community a full range of integrated residential real estate services and the ability to manage the delivery of those services through a centralized source

transaction management services include the coordination and delivery of title insurance  mortgage credit reporting  flood zone determinations  property appraisal and valuation  property inspections  closing and escrow services  and real estate tax processing services 

table of contents appraisal and valuation services through our merger with capital title and its appraisal subsidiary  we offer a broad suite of valuation applications  which include automated valuation models  traditional appraisals  broker price opinions  collateral scores and appraisal reviews utilized by participants in the secondary mortgage markets 
prior to the capital title merger  we offered these services through one of our joint ventures 
as a result of the merger  we had the ability to offer appraisal services directly and we sold our interest in the joint venture 
flood zone determinations landamerica flood services and nationwide total flood services  inc provide mortgage lenders with certifications that indicate whether the property securing the loan is located in a special flood hazard area as defined by the us federal emergency management agency fema 
our flood service includes an initial flood zone determination report provided to the lender at the origination of the loan and subsequent notifications provided to the lender during the term of the loan of any changes in a property s flood zone status brought about by changes in flood insurance rate maps issued by fema 
consumer mortgage credit reporting landamerica credit services is a nationwide provider of consumer credit reports and income  employment  and tax return verifications to lenders engaged in mortgage origination 
our technology interfaces with many loan origination systems and directly with fannie mae and freddie mac and permits hours  days a week monitoring and response 
our credit information is obtained using technology linked to the three major credit repositories equifax  experian and trans union 
in addition  through bureau direct  a borrower s erroneous credit information can be updated at each of the three major credit repositories in hours or less  thereby reducing the necessary paperwork and time required by the borrower and the lender seeking to close a consumer s lending transaction 
although there are numerous suppliers of mortgage origination services to national and regional mortgage lenders  our largest competitors with whom we compete on the business of price and service are first advantage credo  cbc companies  equifax and kroll factual data  inc our loan servicing business provides real estate tax processing services and default management services 
tax services landamerica tax services offers real estate tax processing services to mortgage lenders 
we monitor and report real estate property tax data needed by mortgage lenders on secured properties 
during the lending process  we advise lenders whether any delinquent taxes are associated with the property 
where the lender requires an escrow for the payment of taxes by borrowers during the term of the loan  we determine the timing and amount of the tax payment due on the property and interface with the loan servicing department of the mortgage lender and the various local taxing authorities to facilitate the timely payment of real property taxes 
services performed for mortgage lenders vary significantly 
while some lenders prefer complete outsourcing of all tax service functions  other lenders prefer to perform their own tax services and purchase data from us 
recently  we believe that the trend among large lenders has been to perform certain functions of their own tax processing services  known as insourcing 
we have developed a series of products to provide those lenders with the data and other tools they need to insource their tax service functions 
default management landamerica default services provides comprehensive default management services to lenders and mortgage servicing operations 
these services consist of foreclosure processing  broker price opinions and appraisal coordination  management of properties acquired at foreclosure reo  senior lien monitoring  bankruptcy services and lien processing release 
through a acquisition  we now offer backintheblack  a web based application that focuses on loss mitigation and collections and is implemented with client specific rules to allow client capability to manage the entire default process from beginning to end  from collections to property disposition 
backintheblack transforms default servicing by replacing current home grown  paper based techniques with a unified problem loan underwriting solution 

table of contents although there are numerous suppliers of loan services  our largest competitors with whom we compete on the basis of price and service are the first american corporation and fidelity national financial  inc formerly fidelity national title group  inc 
our subservicing business provides loan subservicing services through our subsidiary  loancare servicing center  inc loancare 
subservicing loancare is an approved servicer for the federal national mortgage association  the federal home loan mortgage corporation  the government national mortgage association  the federal housing administration  the veterans administration  several nationwide financial institutions  and a number of private investors 
our loan subservicing services are offered through interim and private label subservicing programs 
interim subservicing is utilized by lenders selling loans in the secondary market pending the transfer of the loans and the related servicing rights to a permanent purchaser investor 
the private label subservicing program is utilized by lenders wishing to promote the relationship between themselves and their borrowers 
although there are numerous providers of subservicing services  our largest competitors with whom we compete on the basis of price and service are cenlar fsb  gmac mortgage corporation  countrywide home loans  inc and freedom mortgage 
portions of our lender services segment  particularly in our mortgage origination business  have cyclical and seasonal trends similar to our title operations segment 
in contrast  we believe that a higher interest rate environment and weakness in the overall economy may increase the volume of mortgage defaults which increases our default management business 
in addition  in instances where we receive cash in advance for services for real estate tax processing services  the revenue is deferred and amortized ratably over the anticipated life of the loan servicing 
this ratable amortization has the impact of reducing the volatility in revenue related to this segment 
however  loss of a customer may accelerate recognition of revenue in certain periods resulting in one time volatility 
the top five customers in our lender services segment account for approximately percent of operating revenue 
financial services the financial services segment includes orange county bancorp and its wholly owned subsidiary  centennial bank  a california industrial bank we acquired in november centennial 
centennial s primary business is the origination and bulk purchase of commercial real estate loans in the southern california market  and to a lesser degree  in the arizona and nevada markets 
deposits are solicited through the internet for both certificates of deposit and passbook savings accounts 
as an industrial bank  centennial does not accept demand deposits  such as checking accounts  that provide for payment to third parties 
centennial does not offer banking services such as credit cards or automated teller machines 
we utilize centennial to hold a portion of our escrow deposits 
the following is a summary of certain information relating to centennial s deposits  loans and allowances for loan losses for the last five years 
information related to periods prior to the acquisition date has not been included in our financial position and results of operations
