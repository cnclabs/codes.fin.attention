item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview we are a global leader in providing osteo biologic solutions to surgeons and patients for the repair of the musculoskeletal system through the development of innovative therapy driven products that alleviate pain  promote biological healing and restore function 
our goal is to utilize our current technology platform and future technologies  including products under development to create procedure specific solutions for orthopedic  spinal  neurological and oral maxillofacial surgeons to repair and replace bone loss caused by trauma or disease states  augment prosthetic implant procedures  facilitate spine related procedures and replace damaged ligaments and tendons 
we generate the majority of our revenues from fees charged for our allograft bone tissue products  which are distributed to hospitals and surgeons 
our product lines include our proprietary allograft bone tissue grafts  grafton dbm  graftech bio implants and xpanse bone inserts and for the plexur p biocomposite  as well as traditional allograft bone tissue grafts 
when we distribute allograft bone tissue grafts directly to surgeons and hospitals we charge a service fee to the hospital based upon our published end user list price  or in certain instances  based upon a negotiated discount to our end user list price 
we generally charge a contracted service fee for each allograft bone tissue graft provided to stocking distributors 
we also generate revenues by processing donated allograft bone tissue for partner companies or clients  primarily the musculoskeletal transplant foundation mtf  into traditional allograft bone tissue grafts  grafton dbm or private label dbm products  which we return to our partners and clients and they distribute to hospitals and surgeons 
when we process allograft bone tissue for clients or process private label dbm products  we generate revenues by charging our customers a fee for our services 
for the initial processing of the allograft bone tissue  which includes the production of traditional and soft tissue grafts  we generally charge a flat service fee 
when we process grafton dbm or a private label dbm for certain partners or clients  we charge a service fee equal to a specified contractual percentage of the end user price list for each specific product code 
throughout we continued the efforts started in to favorably influence our future gross margins by accelerating the development of new products  increasing our inventory velocity by re aligning our work in process and finished goods tissue inventories  reducing costs  and increasing processing efficiencies by reducing lead times  improving tissue yields and reducing our obsolescence exposure 
we expect to continue these efforts in future periods and anticipate we will realize the benefits of those efforts shortly thereafter 
in  the business returned to profitability and generated a net income of million or 
diluted earnings per share 
we generated positive cash flow in of million  increasing our cash reserves to million as of december  in  we expect to incrementally invest million to enhance our distribution efforts around the world by hiring osteo biologic specialists to augment our existing sales force 
we expect the majority of the osteo biologic specialists will be hired in the first quarter of with a smaller group of specialists hired in the second and possibly third quarter 
we do not expect to realize any significant benefit from these osteo biologic specialists until the second half of we 
table of contents expect to maintain our profitability in at approximately the same levels as  and anticipate increased revenue growth and profitability in as the osteo biologic specialists make an impact on sales  we introduce new products and we continue our productivity improvements 
we also anticipate continuing to improve our cash reserves in as we continue to generate cash flow from operations and monetize our working capital 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates and may adjust them based upon the latest information available 
these estimates generally include those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories including purchase commitments  deferred processing costs including reserves for rework  excess and obsolescence  long lived assets  asset retirement obligations  income taxes  stock based compensation  contingencies and litigation 
we base the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated returns based upon historical experience 
if future returns are less than historical experience  reduction in estimated reserves would increase revenue 
alternatively  should returns exceed historical experience  additional allowances would be required  which would reduce revenue 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
changes in estimates of collection risk related to accounts receivable can result in decreases or increases in current period operating costs 
we write down inventory and deferred processing costs for estimated excess  obsolescence or unmarketable products equal to the lower of cost or market value 
excess and obsolescence could occur from numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the competitive nature of the market  technological change  expiration and changes in surgeon preference 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required  including provisions to reduce inventory and deferred processing costs to net realizable value 
in each period  we also assess our production activity in relationship to historical experience and normal capacity  and evaluate the need to reflect processing costs as either period costs or as a component of deferred processing costs 
in periods where actual processing activities are less than historical experience normal capacity  we charge an appropriate portion of our processing costs directly to cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  we provide reserves  if any  for the difference between our contractual purchase commitments and our projected 
table of contents purchasing patterns based upon maintenance of adequate inventory levels and forecasted revenues 
if actual revenue is less favorable than those forecasted by management  additional reserves may be required  alternatively  if revenue is stronger than forecasted by management  such reserves would be reduced 
we record an asset retirement obligation when an obligation to retire an asset is determined 
the asset retirement obligation is accrued at its estimated fair value with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset  if appropriate 
we determine the amount of the asset retirement obligation based upon a number of assumptions requiring professional judgment and makes adjustments to the asset retirement obligation recorded based on the passage of time  revisions to either the timing  or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows related to the retirement of the asset 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income  in the event that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of a net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we accrue current and future tax liabilities based upon levels of taxable income  tax planning strategies and assessments of the timing of taxability of the tax attributes 
while we have considered current tax laws in establishing tax liabilities  in the event we were to settle such liabilities for less than amounts accrued  we would reduce income tax expense in the period such determination was made 
should we determine it would cost more to settle such liabilities  we would increase income tax expense 
we include in our income tax provision interest and penalties  if any  assessed on us by various taxing authorities 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties and management is unable to predict the outcome of the pending litigation 
when we are reasonably able to determine the probable minimum or ultimate liability  if any  which may result from any of the pending litigation  we will record a provision for our best estimate of such liability  and if appropriate  will record a benefit for the amounts covered by insurance 
if the outcome or resolution of the pending litigation is for amounts greater than accrued  an expense will be recorded in the period the determination is made 
alternatively  should the outcome or resolution be for less than accrued  we would reduce the expense in the period the determination is made 

table of contents results of operations the following table set forth our consolidated results of operations for  and percent change year ended december  vs 
vs 
in thousands revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses operating income loss other income expense income loss before income taxes income tax benefit net income loss earnings loss per share basic diluted net income loss net income for the year ended december  was million or diluted earnings per share and resulted primarily from improved gross margins and reductions in operating expenses as compared to the same respective period in we incurred a net loss in of million or diluted loss per share primarily due to costs incurred to implement our strategic initiatives to re align our work in process and finished goods tissue inventories  which negatively impacted our gross margins  increased operating expenses including charges for the retirement and resignation of three former executive officers  foreign currency translation losses on intercompany debt and an income tax benefit on our operating loss at an effective tax rate substantially lower than the statutory rate 
in  the net loss of million or 
diluted loss per share resulted primarily from the impairment of certain assets related to our former processing environment  a severance charge for the reorganization of our sales and marketing organizations  provisions for the exit from our metal spinal implant product lines and a disproportional effective tax rate 

table of contents revenue for the year ended december   revenues increased to million as compared to revenues of million 
revenues increased principally from increased unit sales volume in our dbm segment and our traditional tissue product lines 
in addition  we recognized revenues from two new products effectively introduced in  the xpanse bone insert and graftcage spacers 
we also recognized revenue declines from the distribution of our graftech bio implants due to competitive pressures from polymer based structural implants and from fees associated with our processing of donors for mtf 
revenues increased in to million as compared to revenues of million 
the increase in revenues resulted principally from increased average unit selling prices related to the distribution of grafton dbm domestically because of an increase in unit sales volume sold directly by our agency sales force and a decline in unit sales volume by our clients  and increased unit volumes in the international distribution of grafton dbm 
effective december   we re aligned our operating segments to be more reflective of our expected future business strategies  technology and product development activities and distribution efforts 
in assessing the re alignment of our operating segments  we considered our current and future business opportunities  current and future products and technologies  the markets in which we sell  and the revenue and cost make ups of our previous business segments 
the development of the new business segments included assessments made by senior management as well as a review process with our board of directors 
in addition to the re alignment of our operating segments  we have created a corporate segment 
the corporate segment includes the costs associated with general and administrative  regulatory and research and development activities 
all segmental information included elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflects the new operating segments 
all prior years information included herein has been re stated in line with the new operating segments 
the following table details the components of our revenues for the years presented percent change year ended december  vs 
vs 
in thousands dbm segment traditional tissue segment spinal allograft segment hybrid synthetic segment client services segment other product lines revenue compared to dbm segment revenues  which consists primarily of domestic and international grafton dbm revenues  revenues from the xpanse bone inserts and revenues from the processing of two private label dbms  increased in as compared to grafton 
table of contents dbm revenues increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in substantially as a result of an increase in world wide unit sales volume  partially offset by a decline in average selling prices  principally in the domestic market due to competitive pressures 
we believe we have taken appropriate measures to manage the price pressures on our grafton dbm unit sales and do not expect pricing pressures to be a significant influence on revenues 
revenues from the shipment of private label dbm tissue forms increased in compared to  primarily due to increased unit volumes based on our partners sales levels to end users 
a portion of the increase in revenues was related to introduction of the xpanse bone insert in late  which contributed million to the revenue growth 
we expect to continue to expand distribution of our xpanse bone inserts in as we continue to gain surgeon acceptance of the product 
revenues from the world wide distribution of traditional allograft bone tissue grafts increased in compared to the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in unit sales volume in all markets in which we distribute 
in  we expect to continue to expand our international traditional tissue business  but expect our domestic traditional tissue revenues to remain relatively flat as we match unit sales demand with allograft bone tissue supply 
our domestic traditional tissue business is primarily driven by cancellous tissue products and allograft sports medicine grafts 
obtaining allograft tissue to support these products is not a primary focus of our domestic tissue supply initiatives 
revenues in the spinal allograft segment are primarily driven by our domestic distribution of graftech bio implants 
our graftech bio implant business has been declining over the last several years due to increased competition and surgeon use of polymer based spinal interbody fusion devices 
we anticipate that our domestic graftech bio implant business will decline slightly in  but we expect to begin offering bio implant solutions to our international distributors and surgeons  although there can be no assurance that our graftech bio implant products will gain acceptance in the international market 
in  revenues in the hybrid synthetic segment represented sales of our graftcage spacers  which were introduced in we do not anticipate revenues from the distribution of graftcage spacers to be a significant contributor to our future revenues streams 
beginning in  revenues from our plexur p biocomposite will be reported in this segment 
the plexur p biocomposite was approved by the fda in january we expect to begin distributing the plexur p biocomposite in march to centers of excellence to obtain human clinical information about the efficacy of the product prior to a world wide launch in the third quarter of service fees generated by the processing of allograft bone tissue for our clients declined in as compared to primarily due to processing fewer donors for mtf 
we anticipated revenues in the client services segment to decline in and as we process fewer donors for mtf 
we expect our contractual agreements with mtf will expire at the end of and  therefore  expect revenues in this segment to be an insignificant portion of our revenue beginning in other revenues  which primarily represent sales of xenograft tissue products processed at our facility in france  were relatively flat in compared to compared to 
table of contents dbm segment revenues increased in as compared to grafton dbm revenues increased in compared to substantially as a result of recognition of higher per unit selling prices from the continued implementation of our domestic strategic initiative to distribute our proprietary products directly to end users  for which we recognize a greater portion of the end user selling price  increased penetration in existing international markets and the continued expansion of our international business 
revenues from the shipment of private label dbm tissue forms declined in  primarily due to a reduction in orders from one of our partners as they adjusted their inventory levels 
revenues in the traditional tissue segment  which are primarily generated from the world wide distribution of traditional tissue  increased in compared to  mainly from increased unit sales volume as we continued to expand our world wide presence in this market 
revenues in the spinal allograft segment are generated from the distribution of graftech bio implants  which declined in compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower demand and increased competition from polymer based spinal implants 
service fees generated by processing allograft bone tissue for clients in the client services segment declined in as compared to  primarily due to processing fewer donors for clients in  partially offset by a increase in the average processing fee per donor in revenues from other product lines in related to the distribution of xenograft tissue grafts in europe and the middle east 
in  revenues from other product lines included revenues from xenograft tissue grafts and revenues from the distribution of metal spinal implants prior to our exit from that product line in june  major customers in and  mtf accounted for million and million  or and  respectively of net revenues 
in  mtf accounted for million  or of net revenues 
in  the american red cross tissue services arc accounted for  or of net revenues 
in january   mtf acquired the assets of the allograft tissue banking operation of arc 
gross margin year ended december  in thousands gross profit gross margin in  gross margin increased over gross margin levels in  primarily due to the improvement in revenues  which resulted in better absorption of fixed costs  and the benefits from our strategic productivity initiatives which reduced costs and lead times  improved tissue utilization and yields  and reduced obsolescence exposures 
we anticipate additional improvement in our gross margin in and have projected a second half gross margin target of between and 
table of contents gross margin declined in as compared to primarily due to the costs associated with implementing our strategic initiative to reduce work in process and finished goods tissue inventories and increase overall tissue inventory velocity  which resulted in our decision in may to reduce unit production levels below unit sales levels for the balance of to allow us to consume existing tissue inventories and directly reduce overall tissue inventory levels 
as a result of this decision  our production activities fell below the range of normal capacity  as defined in sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment to accounting research bulletin no 
 resulting in charges of million 
in addition  we also recognized charges of million related to reserves and write offs for excess  obsolete and expiring tissue inventories  primarily in the graftech bio implant product line  as a result of our standard inventory policies and procedures and to address our tissue inventory strategic initiatives 
operating expenses percent change year ended december  vs 
vs 
in thousands marketing  selling and general and administrative research development total in  marketing  selling and general and administrative expenses declined when compared to  principally due to certain expenses  as more fully described in the succeeding paragraph  incurred in which did not recur in  and due to our efforts to control our operating costs  partially offset by reserves for the settlement of certain litigation in the amount of 
million and accruals for management and employee bonuses 
marketing  selling and general and administrative expenses increased in as compared to  principally due to the costs associated with strengthening and diversifying our domestic tissue sources of million  severance and retirement costs of million associated with the retirement of our former chief executive officer and chief financial officer  the resignation of our former chief science officer and certain other employees terminated in the fourth quarter of  increased professional fees  including the costs of million associated with mtf s unsolicited proposal to acquire osteotech  and increased commissions associated with the increase in revenues 
in  research and development expenses declined slightly as compared to  primarily due to the re focusing of our efforts on specific research and development programs and the completion of certain programs with the introduction of the xpanse bone inserts and graftcage spacers in late and early research and development expenses increased in compared to due to the timing of completion of research and development programs  our efforts related to the development of new product lines or line extension for existing product lines 
we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase slightly in and we expect to spend an incremental million on improving our distribution effectiveness 
we expect that research and development expenditures will increase in due to increased activity on existing projects and programs and initiation of new projects and programs 

table of contents operating income loss percent change year ended december  vs 
vs 
in thousands dbm segment traditional tissue segment spinal allograft segment hybrid synthetic segment client services segment other product lines corporate operating income loss we generated an operating income of million in compared to incurring operating losses in and the operating income in was primarily generated by improved gross margins and a reduction in operating expenses  both of which are more fully explained in gross margin and operating expenses above 
operating income in the dbm segment increased in as compared to mainly due to the increase in revenue and lower selling and marketing expenses as a result of reconfiguring the commission program  partially offset by a slightly lower gross margin due to the impact of pricing pressures 
the improvement in the operating income in the traditional tissue segment  the spinal allograft segment and the client services segment in was primarily due to improved gross margins 
the operating loss in the hybrid synthetic segment is due to the costs to launch the graftcage spacers 
the reduction in the operating loss in corporate is due mainly to reductions in general and administrative expenses in compared to the operating loss in increased compared to mainly due to lower gross margins as a result of our strategic initiatives for work in process and finished goods inventories and increased operating expenses 
the traditional tissue segment  the spinal allograft segment and the client services segment bore a substantial portion of the charges related to our strategic initiatives 
the operating income in the dbm segment improved in compared to principally due to the increase in revenues in the increase in operating costs in corporate during is mainly related to a severance and retirement costs  costs associated with strengthening and diversifying our domestic tissue sources and professional fees 
other income expense other expense in of 
million is principally the result of million in interest expense associated with our capital lease obligation  partially offset by interest income of 
million on invested cash balances  foreign currency translation gains of 
million primarily related to intercompany debt and a 
million gain from a contingent consideration payment related to the sale in of a foreign subsidiary 

table of contents in  other expense of million primarily represents interest expense of million related to our long term debt  which was repaid in full in august  and the capital lease obligation  which arose in the sale and leaseback of our principal processing facility in august  and foreign currency translation losses of 
million primarily related to intercompany debt 
other expense was partially offset by interest income on available cash balance of 
million in other income of 
million in related mainly to the gain on the sale of the intellectual property associated with the ovation spinal system of 
million  foreign currency translation gains on intercompany debt  and interest income of 
million  partially offset by interest expense on our long term debt of 
million 
on july   the board of directors declared million of intercompany loans between the domestic company and our french subsidiary to be permanent debt requiring no principal payments on such intercompany loans for the foreseeable future 
as a result  and pursuant to sfas no 
 since july  our results of operations will not be impacted by the effects of variations in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro on that portion of the intercompany debt 
the remaining outstanding balance under intercompany loans between the domestic company and our french subsidiary will continue to be subject to variations in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro 
future translation gains and losses may have a material impact on our results of operations in the event of significant changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro  although the impact of such gains and losses should not have any impact on consolidated cash flows 
income tax provision in  we provided an income tax benefit primarily due to the reversal of certain domestic state tax reserves  which were no longer required  partially offset by provisions for minimum state income taxes 
no provision for federal or foreign taxes has been recorded due to the availability of prior year net operating loss carryforwards  which carry a full valuation allowance  or due to recognizing a current year taxable loss for which any tax benefits or assets would be fully offset by the establishment of valuation allowances 
we have evaluated the continuing need for our valuation allowances for our domestic and foreign deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  and we have determined based on our assessment that there is not sufficient positive evidence to support the reversal of such valuation allowances due to continued losses for tax purposes 
we intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of such valuation allowances 
we will continue to assess the need to maintain existing valuation allowances or to record additional valuation allowances based on facts and circumstances in each future period 
in  we provided a benefit for income taxes primarily for our ability to carryback our current year losses to prior tax years and obtain refunds and a non cash charge to establish a valuation allowance for all domestic and foreign deferred tax assets 
aggregate cumulative losses generated by our domestic operation over the last several years and the potential for operating losses in the future represents sufficient negative evidence under sfas no 
to require the establishment of a valuation allowance 

table of contents in  we provided a benefit for income taxes related mainly to losses in our domestic operations  mostly offset by a provision for income taxes for our french subsidiary and a non cash charge to establish a valuation allowance for domestic state deferred tax assets liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  working capital increased to million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in working capital in resulted primarily from our improved operating results 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to net cash used by operating activities was million in the improvement resulted primarily from the generation of a net income in compared to a net loss in  partially offset by our investment in working capital 
net cash used by investing activities in was million  which was principally used to fund capital expenditures 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in  which is principally due to the sale of our principal processing facility for million in cash  partially offset by capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities in and of 
million and million  respectively  relates primarily to principal payments on our capital lease obligation and in to the repayment of all outstanding long term debt in august  and principal payments on long term debt 
such cash uses were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan 
in february  we entered into a million line of credit with a banking institution 
the line of credit effectively makes million available  since all amounts borrowed over million needs to be cash collateralized 
the line of credit expires in february and is secured by accounts receivable 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at the prime rate or libor plus 
the line of credit includes certain financial and operational covenants and includes subjective acceleration provisions 
such provisions are based upon  in the reasonable opinion of the banking institution  the occurrence of any adverse or material change in the condition or affairs  financial or otherwise  of the company which impairs the interests of the banking institution 
at december   we had domestic federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards expire in and the state net operating loss carryforwards primarily offset new jersey taxable income  which expire in varying amounts beginning in through in addition  we have domestic federal research and development credits of 
million  which expire in and state research and development  manufacturing and other credits of 
million  primarily to offset new jersey income taxes  which expire in varying amounts beginning in through at december   we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards aggregating million expiring in varying amounts beginning in we have not recognized any benefit from these net operating loss carryforwards in the consolidated financial statements because realization of the future tax benefits is uncertain 
we have provided a full valuation allowance for all federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  all federal and state tax credits and all foreign net operating loss carryforwards due to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from these net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
in we wrote off certain of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards of related to our inactive subsidiaries in the netherlands 
these foreign net operating loss carryforwards carried a full valuation allowance 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
less than one years years after in thousands total year years capital lease obligation non cancelable operating lease obligations retirement and severance payments asset retirement obligation shrewsbury facility asset retirement obligation eatontown facility reimbursement under tissue supply agreements represents the future value of the eatontown asset retirement obligation as of december  this asset retirement obligation will be accreted from its current value as of december  of million to its future value over the next nineteen years 
represents the minimum reimbursement to be made under our agreements with mtf and cts for their services of donor recovery and donor eligibility related to the allograft bone tissue to be supplied to us over the current term of the related agreements 
based on our current projections and estimates  we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents and anticipated future cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our forecasted cash needs in our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of our product development programs and the need and associated costs relating to regulatory approvals  if any  which may be needed to commercialize some of our products under development  and the resources we devote to the development  manufacture and marketing of our services and products 
we may seek additional funding to meet the needs of our long term strategic plans 
we can provide no assurance that such additional funds will be available  or if available  that such funds will be available on favorable terms 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we have not participated in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spe  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange fluctuations the results of operations for the periods discussed have not been materially affected by inflation 
we are subject to foreign currency fluctuations for material changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro 
as our foreign operations continue to grow and represent a larger percentage of our consolidated revenues and profits  foreign currency translation adjustments will impact our operating results to a greater extent 
the exchange rate as of december  was us dollars to one euro compared to an exchange rate of us dollars to one euro as of december  the average exchange rate for the year ended december  was us dollars to one euro compared to an average exchange rate for the year ended december  of us dollars to one euro
