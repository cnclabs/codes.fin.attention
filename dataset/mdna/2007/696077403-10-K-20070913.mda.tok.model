item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements filed as part of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we believe that our accounting policies and estimates relating to revenue recognition  accrued expenses and stock based compensation charges are the most critical 
revenue recognition revenue from corporate collaborations and licensing agreements consists of up front fees  research and development funding  and milestone payments 
non refundable up front fees are deferred and amortized to revenue on a straight line basis over the related performance period 
we estimate the performance period as the period in which we perform certain development activities under the applicable agreement 
estimated reimbursements for research and development activities and government grants are recorded in the period that we perform the related activities under the terms of the applicable agreements 
revenue resulting from the achievement of milestone events stipulated in the applicable agreements is recognized when the milestone is achieved  provided that such milestone is substantive in nature 
in  we entered into a collaborative development and marketing agreement with king to jointly develop and commercialize bremelanotide 
deferred revenue related to the king agreement has been recognized as revenue over the estimated period of our performance during the initial development term of this agreement 
specific performance periods were not stated in the agreement and were estimated by management based on detailed development programs agreed upon by the parties 
in september  we received notice from king terminating the agreement in accordance with its terms effective december  upon termination  we will solely own all rights to bremelanotide 
in connection with the termination of the agreement  we expect to recognize in our fiscal year ending june  all remaining deferred up front license fees received from king  together with associated deferred costs  which prior to termination were being recognized as revenues and costs over the estimated period of our performance under the agreement 
as of june   deferred revenue and deferred costs  included in other current assets and other assets  amounted to  and  respectively 
deferred revenue related to the astrazeneca agreement is being recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the maximum period during which we may perform research services under the agreement 
if our estimated period of performance is reduced to less than the maximum  the amortization period for any remaining deferred revenue may be reduced 
accrued expenses a significant portion of our development activities are performed by third parties 
we review the activities performed under significant contracts each quarter and accrue expenses and the amount of any reimbursement to be received from our collaborators based upon the estimated amount of work completed 
estimating the value or stage of completion of certain services requires judgment based on available information 
if we do not identify services performed for us but not billed by the service provider  or if we underestimate or overestimate the value of services performed as of a given date  reported expenses will be understated or overstated 
stock based compensation the fair value of stock options granted has been calculated using the black scholes model  which requires us to make estimates of volatility and expected option lives 
we estimate these factors at the time of grant based on our own prior experience  public sources of information and information for comparable companies 
the amount of recorded compensation related to an option grant is not adjusted for subsequent changes in these estimates or for actual experience 
the amount of our recorded compensation is also dependent on our estimates of future option forfeitures and the probability of achievement of performance conditions 
if we initially over estimate future forfeitures  our reported expenses will be understated until such time as we adjust our estimate 
changes in estimated forfeitures will affect our reported expenses in the period of change and future periods 
certain options are subject to periodic re measurement over the vesting period as services are rendered  based on changes in the fair value of our common stock 
the vesting of certain other options is dependent on future events 
in addition  the amount and timing of compensation expense to be recorded in future periods related to grants of restricted stock units may be affected by grantee terminations and certain changes in our share price 
as a result  share based compensation charges may vary significantly from period to period 

table of contents results of operations year ended june  compared to the year ended june  licenses  grants and contracts in the year ended june  fiscal  we recognized million of revenue from licenses  grants and contracts compared to million for the year ended june  fiscal 
in fiscal and fiscal  we recognized million and million of revenue  respectively  from our collaboration agreement with king related to bremelanotide  consisting of i million and million  respectively  of reimbursements for king s share of bremelanotide development expenses and ii million and million  respectively  of license fees  which represents the portion of deferred revenue recognized during the year from king s august up front payment 
the decrease in reimbursement revenue from king is related to decreased reimbursable bremelanotide costs during the year 
reimbursable bremelanotide costs were higher in fiscal due to the conduct of two significant phase clinical trials 
upon the termination of our collaboration agreement with king  we will no longer receive such reimbursement revenue 
in fiscal  we recognized less license revenue related to the king agreement as a result of increasing our estimated period of performance under the agreement 
in connection with the termination of our collaboration agreement  we expect to recognize in the year ending june  fiscal the remainder of the deferred revenue related to king s up front payment 
in fiscal  we recognized million of revenue related to our january license agreement with astrazeneca 
this amount consists of million of revenue related to our research services performed during the year and million of license revenue related to astrazeneca s million up front license fee received at the inception of the agreement 
revenue from reimbursements for mallinckrodt s share of neutrospec development expenses amounted to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
future contract revenue from astrazeneca and mallinckrodt  in the form of reimbursement of shared development costs and the recognition of deferred license fees  will fluctuate based on development activities in our obesity and neutrospec programs 
we may also earn contract revenue based on the attainment of certain development milestones 
royalties for fiscal and fiscal  we recognized royalty revenues of and million  respectively  on mallinckrodt s sales of neutrospec  pursuant to our collaboration agreement 
we received fda approval to market neutrospec in july and suspended sales in december we will not earn future royalty revenues from neutrospec unless and until neutrospec sales resume 
cost of product sales and royalties royalty expense amounted to and million in fiscal and  respectively 
we will not incur future royalty expenses on neutrospec unless and until commercial sales of neutrospec resume 
research and development research and development r d expenses decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal in fiscal  development spending directly associated with bremelanotide decreased approximately million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal costs related to the conduct of various clinical trials were higher in fiscal  including costs of an at home efficacy study in ed patients and an at home efficacy study in ed patients with diabetes mellitus 
associated costs include fees to clinicians  laboratory expenses and study monitoring and management 
partially offsetting decreased clinical study costs were greater process development and manufacturing costs in fiscal in fiscal  fiscal and the year ended june  fiscal and cumulatively to date  we have incurred approximately million  million  million and million  respectively  in r d expenses on bremelanotide  including an allocated portion of general r d expenses 
spending to date has been primarily related to formulation  manufacturing  preclinical and clinical activities 
bremelanotide spending in fiscal will be dependent on our review of the fda s comments and decisions regarding the design and timing of any future clinical trials 
research and development expenses directly related to our obesity  chf and other preclinical programs increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal spending on our obesity and chf programs increased approximately million and million  respectively 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal and cumulatively to date  we have incurred approximately million  million  million and million  respectively  in r d expenses on these preclinical programs  including an allocated portion of general r d expenses 
spending to date has been primarily related to the identification and optimization of lead compounds 
we expect to spend approximately million to million of direct costs during fiscal on laboratory research on various compounds  which may increase in the event we file an ind and commence clinical trials for a compound 
the amount of such spending and the nature of future development activities are dependent on a number of factors  including primarily the success of our discovery programs  preclinical studies  our ability to progress a compound into human clinical trials and discussions with astrazeneca and other potential development partners 

table of contents in fiscal  research and development spending directly related to neutrospec decreased to million from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of lower costs related to manufacturing and process development activities 
we have suspended substantial development activities  including research to evaluate neutrospec s potential as an imaging agent for other indications such as osteomyelitis infection deep inside a bone  fever of unknown origin  post surgical infection  inflammatory bowel disease and pulmonary imaging 
we expect to spend approximately million to million of direct costs on neutrospec on a quarterly basis in this calendar year to review the safety of neutrospec and explore other indications  a portion of which will be reimbursed by our collaboration partner  mallinckrodt 
the amount of such spending and the nature of future development activities are dependent on a number of factors  including primarily the review of neutrospec safety and discussions with both the fda and mallinckrodt 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal and cumulatively to date  we have incurred approximately million  million  million and million  respectively  in r d expenses on neutrospec  including an allocated portion of general r d expenses 
spending to date has been primarily related to an initial indication of imaging equivocal appendicitis 
total general r d expenses  increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to increased personnel costs  including higher costs for stock based compensation  and additions to laboratory facilities 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase primarily reflects higher personnel costs in fiscal  including higher stock based compensation expense 
increased legal expenses related to collaborative agreements and arbitration proceedings partially offset lower insurance costs that followed the withdrawal of neutrospec 
investment income investment income increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily reflecting income on greater invested cash balances maintained during the period as a result of our february registered direct offering of common stock and the initial license fee from astrazeneca 
income tax benefit during fiscal and fiscal  we sold new jersey state net operating loss carryforwards  which resulted in the recognition of million and million of income tax benefits  respectively 
assuming the state of new jersey continues to fund this program  which is not assured  the amount of net operating losses and tax credits we may sell will depend upon the allocation among qualifying companies of an annual pool established by the state of new jersey 
year ended june  compared to the year ended june  licenses  grants and contracts for fiscal  we recognized million of revenue from licenses  grants and contracts compared to million for fiscal in fiscal and fiscal  we recognized million and million of revenue  respectively  related to our collaboration agreement with king related to bremelanotide  consisting of i million and million  respectively  of reimbursements for king s share of bremelanotide development expenses and ii million and million  respectively  of license fees  which represents the portion of king s august up front payment recognized as revenue during the year 
the increase in reimbursement revenue from king is related to increased bremelanotide costs during the year and to the existence of the collaboration agreement for the full fiscal year 
the agreement with king was completed in august in fiscal and fiscal  we recognized million and million of revenue  respectively  related to our collaboration agreement with mallinckrodt related to neutrospec  consisting of i million and million  respectively  of reimbursements for mallinckrodt s share of neutrospec development expenses and ii and million  respectively  of license fees 
in fiscal  we earned a million milestone payment from mallinckrodt upon fda approval of neutrospec 
royalties for fiscal and fiscal  we recognized royalty revenues of million and million  respectively  on mallinckrodt s sales of neutrospec  pursuant to our collaboration agreement 
royalty revenues were comparable in fiscal and fiscal  reflecting higher unit sales by mallinckrodt during the shorter  six month period of fiscal in which the product was sold 
product sales prior to the suspension of sales and marketing activities  we earned revenue from product sales on our shipment of manufactured units of neutrospec to mallincrodt  which were billed upon shipment of product to mallinckrodt on standard trade terms 
revenue was recognized upon acceptance of the product by mallinckrodt based on conformance with product specifications 
each mallinckrodt purchase of neutrospec from us was subject to certain minimum quantities  resulting in a limited number of product shipments 
accordingly  our periodic revenue from product sales was highly dependent on the timing of orders and shipments 
there were no sales of neutrospec to mallinckrodt during fiscal 
table of contents cost of product sales and royalties as noted above  there were no sales of neutrospec to mallinckrodt in fiscal in fiscal  cost of product sales represents our write off of inventory due to the suspension of sales of neutrospec 
for fiscal  we recognized million in cost of product sales related to shipments of neutrospec to mallinckrodt 
prior to the fda approval of neutrospec in july  all costs associated with the manufacturing of neutrospec were included in research and development expenses when incurred  including costs of usable raw materials and finished goods in inventory at the date of approval 
as we used and sold this inventory  the cost of product sales we recognized excluded amounts previously expensed 
on the date of approval  we had sufficient active drug substance to produce all of the product units sold prior to december cost of sales for these units primarily consisted of packaging and other materials 
royalty expense amounted to approximately million in each of fiscal and fiscal we will not incur future royalty expenses on neutrospec unless and until commercial sales of neutrospec resume 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal in fiscal  development spending directly associated with bremelanotide increased approximately million  as increased clinical study costs related to the conduct of various clinical trials  including an at home efficacy study in ed patients and an at home efficacy study in ed patients with diabetes mellitus were partially offset by lower formulation development costs 
associated costs include fees to clinicians  laboratory expenses and study monitoring and management 
research and development expenses directly related to our obesity  chf and other preclinical programs increased from million to million from fiscal to fiscal  primarily as a result of additional contract services for assistance with the optimization of lead compounds 
in fiscal  research and development spending directly related to neutrospec decreased slightly from million in fiscal to million  primarily as a result of lower costs related to clinical trials 
total general r d expenses increased million in fiscal  primarily due to increased personnel costs  including the recognition of compensation costs for stock option grants  the expansion of facilities and associated support costs 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal increased personnel costs in fiscal were more than offset by lower legal and consulting expenses 
legal expenses related to collaborative agreements and arbitration proceedings  recruiting fees and expenses related to compliance with new regulatory requirements were all higher in fiscal investment income investment income increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily reflecting higher cash balances resulting from our sales of common stock and warrants 
income tax benefit during fiscal and fiscal  we sold new jersey state net operating loss carryforwards  which resulted in the recognition of million and million of income tax benefits  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have incurred net operating losses  primarily related to spending on our research and development programs 
we have financed our net operating losses primarily through equity financings and revenue received under collaborative agreements 
we will need regulatory approval to market and sell our products 
our product candidates are at various stages of development and will require significant further research  development and testing and some may never be successfully developed or commercialized 
we may experience uncertainties  delays  difficulties and expenses commonly experienced by early stage biopharmaceutical companies  which may include unanticipated problems and additional costs relating to the development and testing of products in animals and humans  product approval or clearance  regulatory compliance  good manufacturing practices  intellectual property rights  product introduction  and marketing  sales and competition 

table of contents failure to obtain timely regulatory approval for our other product candidates and indications would impact our ability to increase revenues and could make it more difficult to attract investment capital for funding our operations 
any of these possibilities could materially and adversely affect our operations 
during fiscal  we used million of cash for our operating activities  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  the receipt of million in license fees from astrazeneca offset higher cash outflows for operating expenses and the effect of higher reimbursement receipts from king in fiscal lower net cash outflows from operations in fiscal resulted from lower operating expenses  amounts received from king under our collaboration agreement  which was completed in august and sales and royalties related to neutrospec 
our periodic accounts receivable balances will continue to be highly dependent on the timing of receipts from our development partners 
upon the termination of our collaboration agreement with king  we will no longer receive reimbursement revenue from them 
in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was million primarily reflecting proceeds from the sale of common stock in a registered direct offering completed in february during fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was million and included proceeds from the sale of common stock and warrants to king in september and the sale of common stock and warrants in an april offering 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal of million resulted primarily from the issuance of common stock and warrants to king in connection with the august collaboration agreement 
we have incurred cumulative negative cash flows from operations since our inception  and have expended  and expect to continue to expend in the future  substantial funds to complete our planned product development efforts 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments as of june   together with expected receipts from collaboration and license agreements and other income  are adequate to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
the nature and timing of our development activities are highly dependent on our financing activities 
no assurance can be given that we will earn future milestone payments that are contingent on specified events or that we will not consume a significant amount of our available resources before that time 
we plan to continue to monitor the progress of our development programs and the timing and amount of related expenditures and potential milestone receipts  refine our operations  control expenses  evaluate alternative methods to conduct our business and seek additional financing and sharing of development costs through strategic collaboration agreements or other resources 
we are actively searching for certain products and technologies to license or acquire  now or in the future  and expect to continue to do so 
if we are successful in identifying a product or technology for acquisition  we may require substantial funds for such an acquisition and subsequent development or commercialization 
we do not know whether any acquisition will be consummated in the future or whether we will be able to obtain additional funding if such an acquisition is identified 
we anticipate incurring additional losses over at least the next few years 
to achieve profitability  we  alone or with others  must successfully develop and commercialize our technologies and proposed products  conduct pre clinical studies and clinical trials  obtain required regulatory approvals and successfully manufacture  market and sell such technologies and proposed products 
the time required to reach profitability is highly uncertain  and we do not know whether we will be able to achieve profitability on a sustained basis  if at all 
contractual obligations we have entered into various contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
the following table summarizes our most significant contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period total less than year years years after years facility operating leases    capital lease obligations    notes payable    license agreements     total contractual obligations 
table of contents our license agreements also include royalty and other contingent payment obligations and may be terminated by us under certain conditions 
our license agreements related to neutrospec require royalty payments on commercial net sales and payments of up to million contingent on the achievement of specified cumulative net margins on sales by mallinckrodt 
no contingent amounts will be payable related to neutrospec unless we recommence sales and marketing of neutrospec 
we do not reasonably expect to make any such contingent payments during the next twelve months 
we have a license agreement for patent rights related to certain compounds and methods of treatment for sexual dysfunction 
the license agreement requires contingent payments based on certain upfront fees we receive as a result of a sublicense 
we do not reasonably expect to sublicense such rights or make any material contingent payments during the next twelve months 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
as of june   our cash and cash equivalents were million and investments  which consisted of mutual funds  were million 
as of june   our cash and cash equivalents were million and investments  which consisted of mutual funds  were million 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  we do not believe that short term fluctuations in interest rates would materially affect the value of our securities 
foreign currency risk 
certain of our operating expenses are billed to us and settled in foreign currencies  primarily the euro 
as of june  and  the amount of accounts payable and accrued expenses denominated in euros was approximately million 
percentage increases in the us dollar cost of euros would result in corresponding increases in such liabilities 
we have not hedged our exposures to foreign exchange fluctuations 
however  we monitor our foreign currency denominated liabilities and commitments on an ongoing basis and may enter into hedging transactions in the future
