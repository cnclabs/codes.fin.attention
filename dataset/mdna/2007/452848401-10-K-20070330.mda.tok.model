item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
general we  through our subsidiaries  are engaged in the manufacture and distribution of building materials to building materials dealers and others located primarily in florida  mississippi  georgia and alabama and to a lesser extent  other states in the southeastern united states 
we have two manufacturing facilities for our products and twelve distribution facilities through which we market certain of our manufactured products and products of other manufacturers directly to builders  contractors  and sub contractors 
our business is driven primarily by the level of construction activity in the southeastern united states  particularly the states of florida  georgia  mississippi and alabama 
the majority of our products are sold to contractors  subcontractors and building materials dealers located principally in these states that provide building materials for the construction of residential  commercial and industrial buildings and swimming pools 
the level of construction activity is subject to population growth  inventory of available housing units  government growth policies and construction funding  among other things 
general construction activity had been strong in the southeastern united states during the last several years through the second quarter of during the second quarter of  residential construction demand began to be impacted by a number of factors  including higher interest rates  and increase in available inventory of unsold new and existing homes  and a general moderation in economic conditions compared to prior periods 
as a consequence  residential construction activity and application for building permits for new residential units  considered a strong sign for future construction activity  declined sharply in florida during the six month period ended december  according to the us census bureau  building permits for the construction of new residential units in florida  our largest market  decreased for the six months ended december   compared to the same period in although the depth and duration of the reduction in the construction of new residential units in florida cannot be predicted  based on the downward trend in building permi ts and reports of publicly owned homebuilders  the adverse impact on demand for our products is expected to continue into building permits for new residential units have increased in our markets located in the mississippi and alabama gulf coast region in as compared to residential construction activity is expected to remain strong in those markets due to the rebuilding activities in areas impacted by hurricane katrina 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of such consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as with all estimates and assumptions  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
management bases these estimates and assumptions on historical results and known trends as well as its forecasts as to how these might change in the future 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize revenue when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we generally recognize revenue  net of discounts and allowances  at the point of sale or upon delivery to the customer s site 
for goods shipped by third party carriers  we recognize revenue upon shipment since the terms are fob shipping point 
provisions for the estimated allowance for bad debts are recorded in selling  general and administrative expense at the end of each reporting period 
the amounts recorded are generally based upon the aging of the receivables and the payment histories of customers while also factoring in any changes in business conditions  such as competitive conditions in the market and deterioration in the economic condition of the construction industry  among other things  which may affect customers ability to pay 
as a result  significant judgment is required by us in determining the appropriate amounts to record and such judgments may prove to be incorrect in the future 
we believe that its procedures for estimating such amounts are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when estimates are adjusted to the actual amounts 
misjudgments by us in estimating our allowance for doubtful accounts could ha ve a material adverse affect on our financial condition 
inventory valuation we value inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method or average cost basis 
the difference between fifo and average cost for certain locations that changed from fifo to average cost in is immaterial 
we will record provisions  as appropriate  to write down obsolete and excess inventory to estimated net realizable value 
the process for evaluating obsolete and excess inventory often requires us to make subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels  quantities and prices at which such inventory will be able to be sold in the normal course of business 
accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may cause the actual results to differ from the estimates at the time such inventory is disposed or sold 
we believe that our procedures for estimating such amounts are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subseq uent periods when the estimates are adjusted to the actual amounts 
however  if actual market conditions are less favorable than those assumed by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
as a result  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected 
litigation on an ongoing basis  we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such action  we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement of final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
we accrue legal fees and a loss contingency when we believes a loss is probable and the amount of loss and legal fees can be reasonably estimated 
due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation  it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that have been previously made 
asset impairment our review of long lived assets requires us to initially estimate the undiscounted future cash flow of these assets  whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
if such analysis indicates that a possible impairment may exist  we are required to then estimate the fair value of the asset  principally determined either by third party appraisals  sales price negotiations or estimated discounted future cash flows  which includes making estimates of the timing of the future cash flows  discount rates and reflecting carrying degrees of perceived risk 
the determination of fair value includes numerous uncertainties 
we believe that we have made reasonable estimates and judgments in determining whether our long lived assets have been impaired 
however  if there is a material change in the assumptions used in our determination of fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances influencing fair value  we could be required to recognize a material non cash impairment charge 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method 
the liability method requires that the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the amounts included in our federal and state income tax returns be recognized in the balance sheet 
as we generally do not file our income tax returns until well after the closing process for the year end financial statements is complete  the amounts recorded at year end reflect estimates of what the final amounts will be when the actual income tax returns are filed for that fiscal year 
in addition  estimates are often required with respect to  among other things  the appropriate state income tax rates to use in the various states in which our company and its subsidiaries are required to file  the potential utilization of operating and capital loss carry forwards for both federal and state income tax purposes and valuation allowances required  if any  for tax assets that may not be realizable in the future 
we believe that the amounts recorded as deferred income tax assets will be recoverable through future taxable income generated by us 
although there can be no assurance that all recognized deferred tax assets will be fully recovered  we believe the procedures and estimates used in our accounting for income taxes are reasonable and in accordance with estab lished tax law 
our anticipated profits from future operations may be adversely affected by various factors including  but not limited to  declines in customer demand  increased competition  the deterioration in general economic and business conditions  as well as many other factors  including those noted under special note regarding forward looking statements  and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and item a risk factors appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview our net sales in increased approximately as compared to demand for products sold by us was strong in the first six months of primarily due to the strength in the new housing and commercial construction markets in a number of our trade areas in the southeastern united states during that period 
however  this demand began slowing down in the third quarter of throughout our florida trade areas 
construction demand remains strong in the gulf coast region in the southeastern united states due to the need to repair damaged property caused by hurricanes katrina and wilma 
we expect such demand to continue to be strong in the foreseeable future in the gulf coast region as rebuilding efforts continue 
our gross margins were lower in compared to  primarily because a greater proportion of consolidated sales were represented by products purchased for resale from non affiliated manufacturers with typically lower gross profit margins  as compared to sales of our manufactured products which generally produce higher gross profit margins 
additionally  increases in raw material costs  in combination with higher freight costs  had a negative effect on the gross margins of our manufactured products in selling  general and administrative expenses increased in compared to  due primarily to higher payroll and other operating costs  principally depreciation expenses  related to supporting additional sales from new and existing facilities 
also  start up costs associated with our new facilities opened in  in combination with costs related to the implementation of our new computer system and expenses associated with the closure of two under performing distribution facilities accounted for a portion of the increased costs in results of operations year ended december  compared to net sales for the year ended december  increased approximately  or approximately compared to the increase in sales was principally due to strength in demand for our products in the new housing and commercial construction markets in our principal trade areas during the first six months of the year  prior to the decline in florida construction activity experienced in the last half of the year 
our new distribution facilities  located in st 
augustine  florida opened in may  fort walton beach  florida opened in september  mobile  alabama opened in february  and brooksville  florida opened in august generated an increase of approximately  in sales in  while facilities located in kennesaw  georgia and rainbow city  alabama were closed in  which represented net sales of approximately  for the year ended december  a significant portion of our sales are generated from the areas impacted by hurricane katrina which struck the gulf coast area of the southeast united states in august in  our gulfport  mississippi distribution facility generated sales of  as compared to sales of  in sales were greater in because of the demand for products for emergency repairs to property damaged by hurricane katrina 
we expect to realize a continuing strong demand for our products in the gulf coast region as hurricane clean up and recovery efforts have given way to rebuilding in the damaged areas 
in addition  hurricane wilma  which struck south florida in october  caused a significant amount of property damage to that area and has created increased demand for certain of the our manufactured products in in the south florida region 
during the second quarter of  residential construction demand began to be adversely impacted by higher interest rates  an increase in available inventory of new and existing homes and a moderation in general economic conditions as compared to prior periods 
as a consequence  residential construction declined in the last six months of in certain of our markets and is expected to result in continuing lower levels of product demand into in the florida market 
construction activity in our markets in florida represent approximately of our consolidated sales for the year however  construction activity in our markets located in mississippi and alabama  which represent approximately of our consolidated sales for  continue to benefit from rebuilding activities in areas impacted by hurricane katrina and are expected to remain solid for the foreseeable future 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales in was approximately  as compared to  for our lower gross profit margins were primarily due to a change in our product sales mix 
a greater proportion of consolidated sales are now represented by products purchased for resale from non affiliated manufacturers with typically lower gross profit margins  as compared to sales of our manufactured products with generally higher gross profit margins due primarily to closing the kennesaw  georgia facility 
in  the sale of products manufactured by premix and dfh represented approximately of consolidated sales as compared to approximately  for the product sales mix in is not expected to materially change during additionally  increases in raw material costs  in combination with higher freight costs  had a negative effect on the gross margins of our manufactured products in also  due to the recent de cline in florida construction activity and reduction in product demand  competition intensified in and gross margins derived from the sale of products purchased for resale from non affiliated manufacturers may decline in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for was approximately  compared to for for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses increased  compared to the increase in expenses for was primarily attributable to an increase of  in payroll and related costs  a  increase in depreciation expense principally for additional delivery and warehouse equipment  including equipment for the new facilities and the new computer system  a  increase in professional fees for accounting and consulting services  and a  increase in non depreciation expenses related to implementing the new computer system 
much of the increase in payroll costs was driven by hiring additional personnel to support our growth in facilities 
also  bad debt expense increased approximately  in compared to attributed in part to the adverse effect the decline in construction activity in the last half of the year had on certain customers 
in addition  terminating the operations at our dallas  georgia and port st 
lucie  florida distribution facilities in resulted in closure costs of approximately  interest expense increased  in  compared to the increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher interest rates and a greater amount of debt outstanding related to the purchase of additional delivery equipment for our expanded facilities and financing a portion of our new computer system 
miscellaneous income  net of expenses  decreased  in  compared to the decrease in miscellaneous income in was primarily due to us recognizing less income from late charge fees generated from our past due receivables in compared to for the year ended december   we recognized income tax expense of  compared to income tax expense of  in the reduction of  of income taxes in compared to is due to lower taxable income and a refund from the overpayment of taxes in as a result of the above factors  we had net income of  or per diluted share  for  compared to net income of  or per diluted share  for year ended december  compared to net sales in increased  or approximately  to  compared to net sales of  for the increase in sales and strong demand for our products is principally due to greater strength in the new housing and commercial construction markets in the our trade areas compared to the same period last year 
in addition  our new distribution facilities  located in st 
augustine  florida opened in may and fort walton beach  florida opened in september accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the increase in sales in a significant portion of our sales are generated from the areas impacted by hurricane katrina that struck the gulf coast area of the southeast united states in the third quarter of although we suffered some damage to our facility located in gulfport  mississippi  the facility  currently our largest distribution location  was able to reopen shortly after the storm 
management estimates that the gulfport facility sales increased approximately  in due to increased demand for its products resulting from emergency repairs to property in the storm damaged area 
we expect to realize a continuing strong demand for its products in the gulf coast market to continue as hurricane clean up and recovery efforts give way to rebuilding in the damaged areas 
in addition  hurricane wilma  which struck south florida in october  caused a significant amount of property damage to that area and is expected to increase demand for certain products 
however  industry shortages of certain products purchased for resale could result in a delay of supply of our products and significantly impact sales in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in was approximately  compared to in our lower gross profit margins in compared to were primarily due to significantly higher cost of sales for our manufactured products produced at our kennesaw  georgia facility 
the and years reflect generally similar competitive conditions in our markets for a majority of the sales of our distributed products  although temporary shortages for certain products became more frequent in also  more intense competitive conditions in for the sale of dfh s manufactured products produced at its kennesaw  georgia facility limited dfh s ability to recover overhead and raw material cost increases through price increases from certain of its customers  as compared to our ability to realize price increases from our customers for its other manufactured and distributed product lines 
the decreased gross margins on dfh manufactured products was a primary factor in our decision to sell certain of dfh s assets to degussa and to cease manufacture of product at the kennesaw facility 
the costs incurred to wind down the manufacturing activities and closure of the kennesaw facility had an adverse effect on dfh s gross margin 
we determined it was not likely that sufficient production efficiencies would be realized from dfh s acrylic stucco manufacturing facility in kennesaw in the future without an inordinate amount of investment and risk to combat increasing costs due primarily to the sharp increase in its raw materials  which are principally oil based 
further  dfh was not able to obtain product liability insurance related to the sale of its acrylic products used in exterior insulation and finish systems eifs since march  accordingly  on september   dfh and its affiliate  premix  entered into the degussa sales agreement  and closed the facility in the fourth quarter of in and  dfh products generated net sales of approximately  and  of which  and  respectively  was sold to its affiliate just rite 
dfh realized an operating loss before corporate allocations of administrative costs of approximately  in  compared to generating operating income of approximately  in plant closure costs and asset disposal costs of approximately  in combination with the operating costs of winding down the plant in the fourth quarter of  had an adverse impact on gross profits and consolidated operating results 
in connection with the degussa sales agreement  just rite entered into the distribution agreement with degussa  a leading manufacturer of eifs  stucco  specialty finishes and architectural coatings in north america  to provide just rite a continuing availability of acrocrete brand products for its customers 
this is expected to en able just rite to leverage its customer service strengths with its distribution network  and ultimately provide just rite a better opportunity to grow this product line with a wider range of products to reach new markets  with greater customer support resources 
we are presently evaluating the opening of additional distribution facilities in an effort to take advantage of our distribution agreement with degussa 
further  degussa has agreed to indemnify just rite for any product liability claims for degussa manufactured products reducing our exposure to future eifs claims 
see item legal proceedings appearing elsewhere in this form k 
in  we completed a plant modernization project with an aggregate investment of approximately  in our premix manufacturing facility located in winter springs greater orlando area  florida in an effort to improve gross profit margins by generating production efficiencies to offset raw material cost increases and to help manage rising operating costs while increasing capacity for future growth 
however  temporary shortages in raw materials in  in combination with the plant s conversion to utilizing new equipment  limited the facility s ability to generate the production efficiencies that were expected from the plant modernization in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for was approximately  compared to in the percentage decrease was primarily the result of certain fixed costs and overhead being absorbed over higher sales volume 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses increased  compared to the increase in expenses for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to an increase of  in payroll and related costs  a  increase in delivery costs necessary to service increased sales  and a  increase in insurance expenses 
in addition  professional fees for accounting and consulting services for income taxes and internal controls increased an aggregate of  in  compared to legal fees  including a loss contingency of  relating to product liability litigation  increased approxim ately  in compared to increases in other operating expenses  primarily those associated with the increased sales  accounted for the balance of the increase in operating expenses in as noted earlier  a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed in nature 
accordingly  operating income is affected materially by fluctuations in net sales 
the significant increase in net sales and gross profits in compared to had a favorable impact on operating income 
as a result of the above factors and the favorable operating leverage gained from the increase in sales  we generated operating income of  in  compared to operating income of  in  an increase of 
interest expense increased  in  compared to the increase in interest expense in was primarily due to a greater amount of debt outstanding related to purchasing the jacksonville  florida distribution facility and delivery equipment and higher interest rates during compared to miscellaneous income  net of expenses  increased  in  compared the increase in relates to various items that individually are not significant 
for the year ended december  we recognized a gain of  from the settlement of litigation against a former employee related to his alleged violation of non compete agreements with us 
for the year ended december   we recognized income tax expense of  compared to income tax expense of  in as a result of the above factors  we had net income of  or per fully diluted share  for  compared to net income of  or per fully diluted share  for liquidity and capital resources at december   we had working capital of approximately  compared to working capital of  at december  the increase in working capital was due primarily to a decrease in notes payable and accounts payable in as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  additionally  we had customer payments in the amount of  that are required to be remitted to our commercial lender upon their bank clearance under the terms of our line of credit 
upon remittance of such amount  the outstanding balance of the line of credit will be reduced  generally resulting in greater borrowing capacity 
sources and uses of cash our operations generated approximately  of net cash from operations in compared to  in the increase in cash flow in was primarily attributable to the cash expended in to build up the inventory 
during  the net expenditures for investing activities were  compared to  in the increase in expenditures in compared to were primarily due to obtaining less proceeds from the sale of assets in compared to  partially offset by reduced capital expenditures 
in  net cash used in financing activities was approximately  compared to net cash used in financing activities of  in payment of long term debt aggregated  and  in and  respectively 
in  we reduced our notes payable line of credit in the net amount of  compared to a decrease of  in the previous year 
in  our restricted cash increased  compared to  in  and we made  in payments to our former preferred stockholders in  compared to  last year 
future commitments and funding sources at december   our contractual cash obligations  with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year  were as follows contractual cash obligations total payment due by fiscal and thereafter long term debt a interest on long term debt b operating leases a purchase obligations c total contractual cash obligations a see notes and in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt and commitments 
b interest payable on long term debt was calculated by using the interest rates in effect at december  for both fixed and variable rate obligations based on the reducing principal balances for such debt for each period in accordance with contractually agreed amortization schedules 
no effect was given for fluctuations in variable interest rates over the terms of such loans 
c in connection with the degussa sales agreement  dfh ceased manufacturing operations at its kennesaw  georgia facility and wound down manufacturing operations during the fourth quarter of as part of the transaction  just rite entered into a three year distribution agreement with degussa 
just rite has agreed to purchase at least  of products manufactured by degussa under the acrocrete brand name over the term of the distribution agreement ending september  in the event just rite fails to purchase a minimum of  of products  it will be required to refund to degussa  of the purchase price plus  once just rite has purchased a minimum of   of the purchase price becomes non refundable and the  is reduced ratably down to zero until  of purchases are achieved 
upon achieving  of purchases  just rite has the option to extend the distrib ution agreement for an additional two years to meet the total purchase commitment 
through december   we have purchased an aggregate of approximately  under the distribution agreement 
although we believe just rite will achieve the minimum level of purchases required under the distribution agreement  there can be no assurance of this because of many risks and uncertainties beyond just rite s control 
our principal source of short term liquidity is existing cash on hand and the utilization of a line of credit with a commercial lender 
premix and just rite borrow on the line of credit  based upon and collateralized by  their eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
generally  accounts not collected within days are not eligible accounts receivable under our borrowing agreement with its commercial lender 
at december    had been borrowed against the line of credit  which bears interest at libor plus at december  our borrowing rate of at such date represents annual interest expense of approximately  based on the outstanding balance at december  the outstanding balance under the line is subject to daily fluctuations 
based on eligible receivables and inventory  we had under our line of credit  total available borrowing capacity including the amount outstanding of   of approximately  at december  trade accounts receivable represent amounts due primarily from subcontractors  contractors and building materials dealers located principally in florida  alabama  mississippi and georgia who have purchased products on an unsecured open account basis and through company owned warehouse distribution facilities 
accounts receivable  net of allowance  at december  was  compared to  at december  the decrease in receivables of  or approximately  was primarily related to decreased sales in the fourth quarter of  as compared to the same period ending december in december  the company approved a plan merging it into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company effective december  the merger as a result of the consummation of the merger with its wholly owned subsidiary  we agreed to pay  in cash to our former preferred stockholders 
at december   we had paid  of such cash amount 
amounts payable to such stockholders at december  results from the former preferred stockholders non compliance with the conditions for payment 
also  we have paid the holders of debentures  which were issued in connection with the merger  an aggregate of  amounts payable to stockholders at december  on our consolidated balance sheet includes  payable to former debenture holders who have not yet tendered their debentures as required by the terms of such merger 
we presently are focusing our efforts on expanding market share through opening new distribution facilities  broadening the product line of our existing distribution facilities in selected markets  evaluating further expansion of our manufacturing capabilities at our two manufacturing facilities  enhancing customer service  increasing operating productivity through capital investment and improving working capital 
we expect to incur various capital expenditures aggregating approximately  during the next twelve months to upgrade and maintain our equipment and delivery fleet to support our existing facilities  including the recent opening of a new distribution facility in ocala  florida 
we expect to finance approximately  of these expenditures from various lenders with the balance funded by cash derived from operations 
in addition  in we are continuing the implementation of a new computer and data processing system fo r inventory  sales management  financial reporting  internal controls and planning to better support management decision making in an effort to keep certain costs to a minimum and more effectively service our customers 
in  we initiated a plan to convert to a new company wide network infrastructure and new accounting software 
this system is a fully integrated enterprise resource planning system which will support management decision making in an effort to more efficiently service our customers 
the initial scope of the project is expected to cost approximately  of which approximately  was financed by a commercial lender in the first quarter of and recorded as long term debt 
as of december   we have capitalized  of costs related to this conversion 
rollout of this new system began in july  and resulted in an increase in operating expense of approximately  including depreciation expense of  during the last six months of such operating expenses are expected to continue at approximately the same rate into the ongoing future 
we entered into an agreement with a communications company to provide a wide area network and other various services for approximately  per month for a month period beginning in april in february  we opened a distribution facility in mobile  alabama  to build market share and to satisfy current product demand resulting from property damage caused by hurricane katrina 
in august we opened an additional distribution facility in brooksville  florida and in march  completed the opening of a facility in ocala  florida 
in addition during  we moved our office headquarters to a new office site in pompano beach  florida to gain more space and to expand the manufacturing and distribution capabilities of the manufacturing facility we formerly shared in pompano beach  florida 
we are currently investigating opening additional distribution facilities to increase market share and generate internal growth in the southeastern united states area 
opening new distribution facilities is dependent upon many factors  including availability of management  competitive conditions and assurances of product avail ability from our principal vendors 
we are required to comply with the requirements in section of the sarbanes oxley act of sox effective in fiscal implementation of sox is inherently costly and unpredictable  making it difficult to accurately estimate the future cost associated with compliance 
future costs associated with sox could materially and adversely affect results of operations and the financial condition 
beginning march   we were forced to renew our products liability coverage with an exclusion for eifs exposure 
due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of litigation  there can be no assurances as to when or if any future uninsured claims may be filed  and if they are  to not be material 
while we do not believe the outstanding insured eifs claims against acrocrete will have a material effect on our financial position  there can be no assurance of this because of the uncertainty of litigation 
see item legal proceedings 
in connection with the degussa sales agreement  we ceased manufacturing operations at our kennesaw  georgia facility in the fourth quarter of ceasing manufacture of acrocrete products for which we were not able to obtain insurance for eifs exposure reduces our litigation risk for that product line in the future 
in addition  as part of the degussa sales agreement  just rite entered into a distribution agreement with degussa  in which degussa has agreed to indemnify just rite against any product liability claims for products manufactured by degussa and sold through just rite 
we believe our cash on hand and the maintenance of our borrowing arrangement with our commercial lender will provide sufficient cash to meet current obligations for our operations and support the cash requirements of our capital expenditure programs 
in the event we elect to accelerate its expansion activities  we may seek additional financing from other sources 
there can be no assurance that any such financing will be available or that we could obtain any such financing on terms suitable to us 
our ability to maintain and improve our long term liquidity is primarily dependent on our ability to successfully maintain profitable operations  resolve litigation on terms favorable to us and meet degussa purchasing requirements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business is subject to certain risks  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  competition  loss of significant customers  customers inability to make required payments  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  changes in accounting rules and requirements  and other governmental regulations and restrictions 
our future results could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
see part i  item a  risk factors and risk factors in our filings with the securities and exchange commission for additional information of our financial exposures 
market risks residential and commercial construction activity our sales depend heavily on the strength of residential and commercial construction activity in the southeastern united states 
the strength of these markets depends on many factors beyond our control 
some of these factors include interest rates  employment levels  availability of credit  supply of unsold residential housing units  real estate prices  weather conditions  and availability of raw materials and products purchased for resale  as well as consumer confidence 
downturns in the market that we serve or in the economy could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
reduced levels of construction activity may result in intense price competition among building materials suppliers  which may adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
our first quarter revenues and  to a lesser extent  our fourth quarter revenues are somewhat adversely affected by winter construction cycles and weather patterns in colder climates as the level of activity in the new construction and home improvement markets decreases 
weather conditions such as heavy rain or snow  will generally preclude customers from installing our products on job sites 
because much of our overhead and expense remains relatively fixed throughout the year  our profits and operating results also tend to be lower and less favorable during the first and fourth quarters 
exposure to interest rates a majority of our debt bears interest at rates that vary with changes in market indexes 
at december   we had aggregate variable rate mortgage notes of  maturing at various dates from march to april the mortgages bear interest at variable rates related to changes in prime  or the day libor rates of interest 
in addition  our  line of credit from a commercial lender now bears an interest rate of day libor plus 
a significant increase in the market index rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  future increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on residential and commercial construction activity and demand for the sale of our products 
if the interest rate increased or decreased  interest expense would increase or decrease approximately  based on the outstanding balance at d ecember  recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued fas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fas fas permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
this statement provides companies the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in september  the sec office of the chief accountant and divisions of corporation finance and investment management released sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab no 
 which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

this statement provides a single definition of fair value  a framework for measuring fair value  and expanded disclosures concerning fair value 
previously  different definitions of fair value were contained in various accounting pronouncements creating inconsistencies in measurement and disclosures 
sfas no 
applies to those previously issued pronouncements that prescribe fair value as the relevant measure of value  except sfas no 
r and related interpretations and pronouncements that require or permit measurement similar to fair value but are not intended to measure fair value 
this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in june  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement eitf 
the scope of eitf includes sales  use  value added and some excise taxes that are assessed by a governmental authority on specific revenue producing transactions between a seller and customer 
eitf states that a company should disclose its accounting policy ie  gross or net presentation regarding the presentation of taxes within its scope  and if significant  these disclosures should be applied retrospectively to the financial statements for all periods presented 
eitf is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of eitf is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation number fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the interpretation contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the interpretation is effective for the first interim period in fiscal years beginning after december  we have not completed our evaluation of the impact of adopting fin and  as a result  we are not able to estimate the effect the adoption will have on our financial position and result of operations

a consolidation the consolidated financial statements contain the accounts of imperial and its wholly owned subsidiaries  premix  just rite  dfh and triple i leasing  inc all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated 
b concentration of credit risk concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers comprising our customer base 
we perform credit evaluations on customers prior to acceptance 
trade accounts receivable are unsecured open accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is considered sufficient to absorb any losses which may arise from uncollectible accounts receivable 
at december  and  we had no significant concentrations of credit risk 
we place our cash with commercial banks 
at december   we had cash balances with banks in excess of federal deposit insurance corporation insured limits 
management believes the credit risk related to these deposits to be minimal 
c allowance for doubtful accounts the collectibility of customer accounts is evaluated routinely based on payment history  current economic condition and an assessment of our lien and bond rights 
we recognize bad debt using the allowance method based on our accounts receivable aging at the end of the period 
the company reviews its accounts receivable aging on a regular basis to determine if any of the receivables are past due

equipment under capital leases is stated at the present value of minimum lease payments at inception 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
maintenance  repairs and minor renewals and betterments are expensed as incurred 
f income taxes the company utilizes the liability method for determining its income taxes 
under this method  deferred taxes and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements or income tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled  valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when the company determines it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
g basic and diluted earnings per share basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year 
diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding plus the additional dilutive effect of common stock equivalents outstanding during the year 
the dilutive effect of options and warrants is calculated using the treasury stock method see note  basic and diluted earnings per share 
h cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents are those highly liquid investments with original maturities when purchased of three months or less 
included in cash and cash equivalents at december  and are short term time deposits of  and  respectively 
i restricted cash at december  and restricted cash consists of  and  respectively  of customer payments that were received and is required to be remitted to the company s commercial lender upon bank clearance under the terms of our line of credit 
such amounts  when remitted to the lender  will reduce the outstanding balance of the line of credit and will generally result in greater borrowing capacity 
j revenue recognition policy the company recognizes revenue when the following four criteria are met 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized net of discounts and allowances  at the point of sale or upon delivery to our customer s site 
for goods shipped by third party carriers  the company recognizes revenue upon shipment since the terms are fob shipping point 
k accounting change prior to january   we measured compensation expense related to the grant of stock options and stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method  under which compensation expense  if any  was generally based on the difference between the exercise price of an option  or the amount paid for an award  and the market price or fair value of the underlying common stock at the date of the award 
because our policy is to grant imperial industries  inc 
and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements continued the company and summary of significant accounting policies continued employee stock options at an exercise price equal to the fair value of the company s stock at the date of grant  we have not recognized compensation expense for our employee stock options prior to january  in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  results for the years ended december  and have not been restated 
the following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value method to account for stock based compensation for the years ended december in thousands  except per share amounts 
net income available to common stockholders  as reported deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards  net of related tax effects net income  pro forma earnings per share basic as reported basic pro forma diluted as reported diluted pro forma effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no

r 
the fair value of any stock options or non vested stock awards  which are subject to graded vesting  granted after january  is expensed based on their graded vesting schedule 
l use of estimates management uses estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the recording of revenues and expenses to prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
m fair value of financial instruments recorded financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  the current portion of long term debt  borrowings under line of credit and debt instruments included in other long term debt 
at december  and  the fair values of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and the current portion of long term debt approximated their carrying values due to the short term nature of these instruments 
the fair values of variable rate borrowings under the line of credit agreement and debt instruments included in long term debt also approximate their carrying value based upon interest rates available for similar instruments with consistent terms and remaining maturities 
n advertising costs advertising costs are expensed as incurred

imperial industries  inc 
and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements continued the company and summary of significant accounting policies continued p segment reporting for the years ended december   and  management has determined that we operated in a single operating segment 
q litigation on an ongoing basis  the company assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions  we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
we accrue legal fees and a loss contingency when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss and legal fees can be reasonably estimated 
due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation  it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that have been previously made 
r assets held for sale at december   we had  in assets held for sale consisting of real property we received in connection with the settlement of litigation with a former employee 
assets held for sale are recorded at fair value at the date of receipt  and reviewed periodically for impairment  with any noted impairment charges taken against earnings 
at december   the remaining asset is recorded in other assets since it is no longer held for sale 
the asset is recorded in the balance sheet in other assets 
s impairment of long lived assets sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is the total by which the carrying amounts of the assets  if any  exceed the fair values determined using a discounted cash flow model 
t product warranty the company provides its customers with limited warranties on certain manufactured products 
limited warranties generally range from to years 
warranty reserves are established based on known or probable claims  together with historical experience factors 
we periodically assesses the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability and adjusts the amount as necessary 
the warranty reserve at december  and of  and  respectively  is recorded in the balance sheet in accrued expense and other liabilities

the company and summary of significant accounting policies continued in september  the sec office of the chief accountant and divisions of corporation finance and investment management released sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab no 
 which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material

eitf states that a company should disclose its accounting policy ie  gross or net presentation regarding the presentation of taxes within its scope  and if significant  these disclosures should be applied retrospectively to the financial statements for all periods presented 
eitf is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of eitf is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation number fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the interpretation contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the interpretation is effective for the first interim period in fiscal years beginning after december  we have not completed our evaluation of the impact of adopting fin and  as a result  we are not able to estimate the effect the adoption will have on our financial position and result of operations

and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements continued related party transactions we and our subsidiaries paid legal fees of approximately   and  in  and  respectively  to a law firm with which one director  our chairman of the board is affiliated 
also  we had amounts payable to this law firm of approximately  and  at december  and respectively 
such fees were primarily for services rendered by members and associates of such law firm other than the one director 
in addition  we paid annual lease payments of  for use of a distribution facility in each of  and  to the former owner of a business acquired by a company subsidiary 
the former owner is currently employed by the company s subsidiary 
also  we employ a relative of a member of management and paid a salary of approximately  in commitments and contingencies a contingencies legal proceedings eifs claims our subsidiary dfh f k a acrocrete  together in three instances with affiliates of dfh and in all instances with non affiliated parties  are defendants in lawsuits pending in various southeastern states  brought by homeowners  homeowners associations  contractors and subcontractors  or their insurance companies  claiming moisture intrusion damage as a result of the use of exterior insulation finish wall systems eifs  on single and multi family residences and to a limited extent  commercial buildings 
our insurance carriers are providing a defense and have accepted coverage under a reservation of rights for of these claims and are providing a defense in three other cases  for which dfh expects its carriers will eventually accept coverage 
in one other recent claim  dfh s insurance carriers have been placed on notice and are expected to provide a defense 
with respect to two claims  the insurance carrier has accepted co verage and will pay all defense and indemnity costs once the self insured retention has been exhausted 
in one other pending eifs claim  dfh is a defendant in a lawsuit styled anthony derck and mary derck v 
stalnaker construction  inc et al 
v 
atrium aluminum production and acrocrete inc in the circuit court of the first judicial circuit in and for walton county  florida  case no 
ca 
the lawsuit involved claims by plaintiffs against dfh for negligent misrepresentation  fraudulent misrepresentation  violation of florida s unfair and deceptive trade practices act and breach of warranty for damages from dfh for moisture damages allegedly caused by dfh s eifs products 
dfh was granted summary judgment on all claims other than negligent misrepresentation and fraudulent misrepresentation 
our insurance carrier provided a defense and accepted coverage under a reservation of rights 
in late january  all defendants except dfh reached a settlement with the dercks in the amount of  in february  the case proceeded to a jury trial with dfh as the lone defendant 
the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the dercks and against dfh for compensatory damages in the amount of  and for punitive damages in the amount of subsequent to the entry of the jury verdict  the court reduced the jury verdict from  to  the court thereafter added  in prejudgment interest and  in costs  bringing the total judgments to  on january   dfh filed notices of appeal of the underlying judgments 
on august   the appellate court  in a per curiam decision  reversed the lower court s judgments and remanded the case for a new final hearing 
as a result of the reversal  the judgments entered against dfh are null and void and of no legal effect 
during a scheduling conference in september  the trial judge scheduled the re trial to take place in august dfh has filed a motion for summary judgment on all of the derks claims which is scheduled to be heard on april  if dfh does not prevail on its motion for summary judgment  the parties are expected to attend mediation before may   the deadline set by the trial judge for the parties to attend mediation 
dfh s insurance carrier has agreed to provide a defense to dfh  and has retained trial counsel on dfh s behalf 
subsequent to the filing of the notice of appeal and as a direct result of the insurance carrier s failure to pay the judgments when entered  dfh filed a notice with the florida department of insurance which is required to commence the statutory waiting period before dfh is permitted to file suit against the insurance carrier for failure to pay the judgments 
imperial industries  inc 
and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements continued commitments and contingencies continued following receipt of dfh s statutory notice  the insurance carrier  liberty mutual insurance company liberty mutual  filed a declaratory judgment action against dfh in federal court in the southern district of florida styled liberty mutual insurance company vs 
dfh  inc et al case no  in which liberty mutual requested the federal court declare as a matter of law that the subject insurance policy does not provide coverage for the underlying compensatory damages judgment entered against dfh in the derck case 
dfh timely asserted cross claims against liberty mutual for payment of the judgments 
the federal court had not yet ruled on the matter prior to the entry of the appellate court s august  decision described above 
while dfh believes that liberty mutual s declaratory judgment action is without merit  at this time it remains uncertain what the effect of the august  appellate court decision will have on the declaratory judgment action 
notwithstanding dfh s dispute with liberty mutual over coverage  liberty mutual has paid all attorney s fees and costs that were incurred on appeal of the judgments  and continues to pay for all attorney s fees and costs incurred in the re trial of this matter 
the six more recent eifs claims that have been filed against dfh are subject to insurance policies that have  self insured retention requirements sir that did not exist in previous insurance policies with other carriers 
pursuant to the sir requirement  dfh is required to make payments towards either the defense or indemnity of these claims  including but not limited to the payment of attorneys fees  costs and settlement payments up to the sir limit 
once the sir limit has been satisfied  the applicable insurance carrier is required to defend and indemnify dfh 
any additional costs that are incurred  whether in the form of defense or indemnity payments  are thereafter the sole responsibility of the insurance carrier up to policy limits 
four of the cases subject to the sir have been settled 
with respect to the two remaining eifs cases  dfh s applicable insurance carrier is expected to accept coverage and to pay all defense and indemnity costs once the sir has been exhausted 
notwithstanding acceptance of such coverage  we believe that all such claims are covered by insurance policies issued by another carrier which do not contain an sir while this prior insurance carrier has initially denied coverage  we believe that discovery in the case will establish facts that will prove that coverage is afforded under these policies and that the prior insurance carrier will be required to defend and indemnify dfh for these claims 
we believe that this will occur well before the applicable sir will have been exhausted by dfh or that dfh will thereafter be reimbursed for any expenses paid 
the allegations of defects in eifs are not restricted to dfh products used in an eifs application  but rather are an industry wide issue 
the alleged failure of these products to perform has generally been linked to improper application and the failure of adjacent building materials such as windows  roof flashing  decking and the lack of caulking 
as insurance markets for moisture intrusion type coverage have all but disappeared  we were forced on march  to renew our existing products liability coverage with an exclusion for eifs exposure 
however  dfh has made a concerted effort to limit its exposure in any such future eifs claims 
for example  dfh instructed its salesmen and independent distributors not to sell acrylic stucco products for eifs applications to end users in the residential construction market and eliminated warranties of acrylic stucco products used in such applications 
in addition  we no longer manufacture such products following the closure of the dfh manufacturing facility in kennesaw  georgia in the fourth quarter of  further reducing future exposure to eifs claims 
following the closure of the dfh manufacturing facility  just rite became a distributor of acrylic stucco products manufactured by degussa under the acrocrete brand 
as part of the di stribution agreement  degussa has agreed to indemnify just rite for any product liability claims for such products 
to date  dfh has not experienced any eifs claims for any periods that would not be covered by insurance 
due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of litigation  there can be no assurance as to when  or if any future uninsured claims may be filed  and if they were  to not be material 
imperial industries  inc 
and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements continued commitments and contingencies continued non eifs claims dfh is a named defendant in four claims alleging moisture intrusion damage to buildings resulting from the use of acrylic stucco products in non eifs applications 
dfh s insurance carriers are providing a defense and have accepted coverage under a reservation of rights for these non eifs claims 
of these four claims  one has no sir  while each of the other three claims is subject to a  sir dfh has exhausted the  sir for these claims 
general historically  there have been resolved eifs claims involving dfh 
the average settlement  together with legal fees and expenses in these eifs claims was approximately  with the exception of two claims  where dfh contributed  towards settlement in december and  towards settlement in august  dfh s applicable insurance carriers have borne complete responsibility for all amounts and dfh has not had to contribute any cash in connection with the settlement of the resolved eifs claims not subject to sir limits 
dfh s administrative costs associated with the resolved eifs claims were not material and there was no material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
we have no reason to believe that  based on such historical experience  the pending eifs and non eifs claims which are not subject to sir limits  will not be similarly resolved and no accrual can reasonably be estimated 
the estimated exposure could range from to some undetermined amount 
management has evaluated the pending eifs claims and  because of the uncertainty of the ultimate settlement of these cases  which may or may not require payment  management does not believe that a reliable estimate of the loss can be made within the above range and therefore  a loss contingency has not been recorded for any of these claims 
losses and expenses in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
based on the pending eifs claims and non eifs claims that are possibly subject to sir requirements contained in the underlying insurance policies with one of its insurance carriers  we have established a loss contingency of approximately  which is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities at december  due to the uncertainty of litigation  loss contingency estimates will continue to be adjusted in future periods based upon the resolution of claims and reported claims when applicable 
just rite  premix and dfh are engaged in other legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of its business  none of which are believed to be material to us 
we are aggressively defending all of the lawsuits and claims described above 
while we do not believe these aforementioned claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  given the uncertainty and unpredictability of litigation there can be no assurance of no material adverse effect 
b k plan we have a profit sharing retirement plan for our employees that is qualified under section k of the internal revenue code 
annual matching contributions are made based on a percentage of eligible employee compensation deferrals 
the contribution is made in cash to the plan on behalf of our employees 
for the years ended december   and  the aggregate contribution required to the plan was approximately   and  respectively

and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements continued commitments and contingencies continued c lease commitments certain property  plant and equipment were leased by us under long term leases which contain provisions for fixed rental increases 
for all noncancellable leases  future minimum lease commitments consisted of the following at december amount and thereafter rental expense incurred for operating leases were approximately   and  for the three years ended december   and  respectively 
d product purchase commitments in connection with the degussa sales agreement  just rite entered into a three year distribution agreement with degussa effective october  pursuant to the distribution agreement  degussa appointed just rite as its exclusive distributor of certain acrylic stucco products previously manufactured by dfh and which will thereafter be manufactured by degussa commencing with the effective date of the distribution agreement 
as part of the distribution agreement  degussa has agreed to indemnify just rite for any product liability claims for such products thereafter manufactured by degussa 
just rite has agreed to purchase a minimum of  of products manufactured by degussa under the dfh brand name over the term of the distribution agreement 
once we have purchased a minimum of  just rite has the option to extend the distribution agreement for an additional two years to meet the total purchase commitment 
for the period october through december  just rite purchased approximately  of products manufactured by degussa pursuant to the distribution agreement 
based on historical sales of this product and future business prospects  we believe just rite will achieve the minimum purchases required under the distribution agreement  although there can be no assurance of this because of many risks and uncertainties beyond our control see note
