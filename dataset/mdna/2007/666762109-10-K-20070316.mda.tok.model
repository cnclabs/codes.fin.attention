we estimate that we hold a share of the commercial bank deposit market in anchorage  a share of the fairbanks market  and a share of the matanuska valley market as of june  our growth and operations depend upon the economic conditions of alaska and the specific markets we serve 
the economy of alaska is dependent upon the natural resources industries  in particular oil production  as well as tourism  government  and us military spending 
according to the state of alaska department of revenue  approximately of the alaska state government is funded through various taxes and royalties on the oil industry

during this time  the average balance of our interest bearing demand deposits increased by million to million at december  from million at december  the average balance of our demand deposits and other noninterest bearing liabilities also increased by million to million at december  from million at december  the increase in these lower cost deposits in helped to contain the rate of growth in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
second  the basis point increase in the yield on earning assets in had a larger effect on net interest income because it was applied to earning assets with an average balance of million versus the basis point increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities that was applied to an average balance of million

analysis of allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate by management to provide for inherent loan losses based on management s assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio  including a review of problem loans  business conditions  estimated collateral values  loss experience  credit concentrations  and an overall evaluation of the quality of the underlying collateral  and holding and disposal costs 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to operations and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
management believes that at december   the allowance is adequate to cover losses that are probable in light of our current loan portfolio and existing economic conditions 
while management believes that it uses the best information available to determine the allowance for loan losses  unforeseen market conditions and other events could result in adjustment to the allowance for loan losses  and net income could be significantly affected  if circumstances differed substantially from the assumptions used in making the final determination

liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds are customer deposits and advances from the federal home loan bank of seattle 
these funds  together with loan repayments  loan sales  other borrowed funds  retained earnings  and equity are used to make loans  to acquire securities and other assets  and to fund deposit flows and continuing operations 
the primary sources of demands on our liquidity are customer demands for withdrawal of deposits and borrowers demands that we advance funds against unfunded lending commitments 
our total unfunded lending commitments at december   were million  and we do not expect that all of these loans are likely to be fully drawn upon at any one time 
additionally  as noted above  our total deposits at december   were million 
the sources by which we meet the liquidity needs of our customers are current assets and borrowings available through our correspondent banking relationships and our credit lines with the federal reserve bank and the fhlb 
at december   our current assets were million and our funds available for borrowing under our existing lines of credit were million 
given these sources of liquidity and our expectations for customer demands for cash and for our operating cash needs  we believe our sources of liquidity to be sufficient in the foreseeable future 
in september  our board of directors approved a plan whereby we would periodically repurchase for cash up to approximately  or  of our shares of common stock in the open market 
in august of  the board of directors amended the stock repurchase plan and increased the number of shares available under the program by of total shares outstanding  or  shares 
we purchased  shares of our stock under this program through december  at a total cost of million at an average price of  which left a balance of  shares available under the stock repurchase program 
we intend to continue to repurchase our stock from time to time depending upon market conditions  but we can make no assurances that we will continue this program or that we will repurchase all of the authorized shares 

table of contents the stock repurchase program had an effect on earnings per share because it decreased the total number of shares outstanding in    and  by    and  shares respectively

at december   the company had million shares of its common stock outstanding 
we are subject to minimum capital requirements 
federal banking agencies have adopted regulations establishing minimum requirements for the capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies 
the requirements address both risk based capital and leverage capital 
we believe as of december   that the company and northrim bank met all applicable capital adequacy requirements 
the fdic has in place qualifications for banks to be classified as well capitalized 
as of june   the most recent notification from the fdic categorized northrim bank as well capitalized 
there were no conditions or events since the fdic notification that we believe have changed northrim bank s classification 
the table below illustrates the capital requirements for the company and the bank and the actual capital ratios for each entity that exceed these requirements 
the capital ratios for the company exceed those for the bank primarily because the million trust preferred securities offering that the company completed in the second quarter of and another offering of million completed in the fourth quarter of are included in the company s capital for regulatory purposes although they are accounted for as a long term debt in our financial statements 
the trust preferred securities are not accounted for on the bank s financial 
table of contents statements nor are they included in its capital 
as a result  the company has million more in regulatory capital than the bank  which explains most of the difference in the capital ratios for the two entities

effects of inflation and changing prices the primary impact of inflation on our operations is increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates  which could affect the degree and timing of the repricing of our assets and liabilities 
in addition  inflation has an impact on our customers ability to repay their loans

the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the company s stock on the date of grant  and the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model  which is consistent with the company s valuation techniques previously utilized for options in footnote disclosures required under fasb r 
the company recognizes the fair value of the restricted stock units and stock options as expense over the required service period  net of estimated forfeitures  using the straight line attribution method for stock based payment grants previously granted but not fully vested at january  as well as grants made after january  as prescribed in fasb r 
as a result  the company recognized expense of  on the fair value of restricted stock units and  on the fair value of stock options for a total of  in stock based compensation expense for the year ending december  prior to january   the company accounted for stock based awards using the intrinsic value method  which followed the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no

table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income 
like most financial institutions  our interest income and cost of funds are affected by general economic conditions  levels of market interest rates  and by competition  and in addition  our community banking focus makes our results of operations particularly dependent on the alaska economy 
the purpose of asset liability management is to provide stable net interest income growth by protecting our earnings from undue interest rate risk  which arises from changes in interest rates and changes in the balance sheet mix  and by managing the risk return relationships between liquidity  interest rate risk  market risk  and capital adequacy 
we maintain an asset liability management policy that provides guidelines for controlling exposure to interest rate risk by setting a target range and minimum for the net interest margin and running simulation models under different interest rate scenarios to measure the risk to earnings over the next month period 
in order to control interest rate risk in a rising interest rate environment  our philosophy is to shorten the average maturity of the investment portfolio and emphasize the pricing of new loans on a floating rate basis in order to achieve a more asset sensitive position  therefore  allowing quicker repricings and maximizing net interest margin 
conversely  in a declining interest rate environment  our philosophy is to lengthen the average maturity of the investment portfolio and emphasize fixed rate loans  thereby becoming more liability sensitive 
in each case  the goal is to exceed our targeted net interest margin range without exceeding earnings risk parameters 
our excess liquidity not needed for current operations has generally been invested in short term assets or securities  primarily securities issued by government sponsored entities 
the securities portfolio contributes to our profits and plays an important part in the overall interest rate management 
the primary tool used to manage interest rate risk is determination of mix  maturity  and repricing characteristics of the loan portfolios 
the loan and securities portfolios must be used in combination with management of deposits and borrowing liabilities and other asset liability techniques to actively manage the applicable components of the balance sheet 
in doing so  we estimate our future needs  taking into consideration historical periods of high loan demand and low deposit balances  estimated loan and deposit increases  and estimated interest rate changes 
although analysis of interest rate gap the difference between the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities during a given period of time is one standard tool for the measurement of exposure to interest rate risk  we believe that because interest rate gap analysis does not address all factors that can affect earnings performance  such as early withdrawal of time deposits and prepayment of loans  it should not be used as the primary indicator of exposure to interest rate risk and the related volatility of net interest income in a changing interest rate environment 
interest rate gap analysis is primarily a measure of liquidity based upon the amount of change in principal amounts of assets and liabilities outstanding  as opposed to a measure of changes in the overall net interest margin 

table of contents the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing  and the resulting interest rate gap  of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the amounts in the table are derived from internal data based upon regulatory reporting formats and  therefore  may not be wholly consistent with financial information appearing elsewhere in the audited financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the amounts shown below could also be significantly affected by external factors such as changes in prepayment assumptions  early withdrawals of deposits  and competition 
estimated maturity or repricing at december  within year years years total in thousands interest earning assets money market investments investment securities loans commercial real estate construction real estate term installment and other consumer total interest earning assets percent of total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand accounts money market accounts savings accounts certificates of deposit fhlb advances other borrowings junior subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities percent of total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets as stated previously  certain shortcomings  including those described below  are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets have features that restrict changes in their interest rates  both on a short term basis and over the lives of the assets 
further  in the event of a change in market interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables as can the relationship of rates between different loan and deposit categories 
moreover  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate debt may decrease in the event of an increase in market interest rates 
we utilize a simulation model to monitor and manage interest rate risk within parameters established by our internal policy 
the model projects the impact of a basis point increase and a basis point decrease  from prevailing interest rates  on the 
table of contents balance sheet over a period of months 
generalized assumptions are made on how investment securities  classes of loans and various deposit products might respond to the interest rate changes 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  and as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income nor precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results would differ from simulated results due to factors such as timing  magnitude and frequency of rate changes  customer reaction to rate changes  changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
based on the results of the simulation models at december   we expect an increase in net interest income of  million and a decrease of  million in net interest income over a month period  if interest rates decreased or increased an immediate basis points  respectively 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles involves the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our estimate for the loan loss reserve is based on our assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio  including a review of problem loans  business conditions  estimated collateral values  loss experience  credit concentrations  and an overall evaluation of the quality of the underlying collateral  and holding and disposal costs 
while we believe that we have used the best information available to determine the allowance for loan losses  unforeseen market conditions and other events could result in adjustment to the allowance for loan losses  and net income could be significantly affected  if circumstances differed substantially from the assumptions used in making the final determination 
controls and procedures conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report  we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures 
our principal executive and financial officers supervised and participated in this evaluation 
based on this evaluation  our principal executive and financial officers each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in timely alerting them to material information required to be included in our periodic reports to the securities and exchange commission 
the design of any system of controls is based in part upon various assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and there can be no assurance that any of our plans  products  services or procedures will succeed in achieving their intended goals under future conditions 
there were no changes in the company s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected  or are likely to materially affect  the company s internal control over financial reporting

estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and revenue and expenses for the period and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
cash and cash equivalents for purposes of reporting cash flows  cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand  amounts due from banks  interest bearing balances with other banks  money market investments including interest bearing balances with the fhlb  banker s acceptances  commercial paper  securities purchased under agreement to resell  and federal funds sold 
investment securities securities available for sale are stated at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses  net of tax  excluded from earnings and reported as a net amount in a separate component of other comprehensive income  unless an unrealized loss is deemed other than temporary 
the gain or loss on available for sale securities sold is determined on a specific identification basis 
held to maturity securities are stated at cost  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount on a level yield basis 
the company has the ability and intent to hold these securities to maturity 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale or held to maturity security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and the establishment of a new cost basis for the security 
unrealized investment securities losses are evaluated at least quarterly on a specific identification basis for securities with similar attributes to determine whether such declines in value should be considered other than temporary and therefore be subject to immediate loss recognition in income 
although these evaluations involve significant judgment  an unrealized loss in the fair value of a debt security is generally deemed to be temporary when the fair value of the security is below the carrying value primarily due to changes in interest rates  there has not been significant deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer  and the company has the intent and ability to hold the security for a sufficient time to recover the carrying value

off balance sheet financial instruments in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into various types of transactions that involve financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
these instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit and are not reflected in the accompanying balance sheets 
these transactions may involve to varying degrees credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount  if any  recognized in the balance sheets 
management does not anticipate any loss as a result of these commitments 
the company s off balance sheet credit risk exposure is the contractual amount of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
the company applies the same credit standards to these contracts as it uses in its lending process 
december  in thousands off balance sheet commitments commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers 
these commitments have specified interest rates and generally have fixed expiration dates but may be terminated by the company if certain conditions of the contract are violated 
although currently subject to draw down  many of the commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
collateral held relating to these commitments varies  but generally includes real estate  inventory  accounts receivable  and equipment 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
credit risk arises in these transactions from the possibility that a customer may not be able to repay the company upon default of performance 
collateral held for standby letters of credit is based on an individual evaluation of each customer s creditworthiness 
note regulatory matters the company and northrim bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and 
table of contents northrim bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the company s and northrim bank s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory practices 
the company s and northrim bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgment by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
federal banking agencies have established minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier i capital to risk weighted assets  and of tier i capital to average assets 
the regulations set forth the definitions of capital  risk weighted and average assets 
as of december   the most recent notification from the fdic categorized the bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
management believes  as of december   that the company and northrim bank met all capital adequacy requirements 
the tables below illustrate the capital requirements for the company and the bank and the actual capital ratios for each entity that exceed these requirements 
the dividends that the bank pays to the company are limited to the extent necessary for the bank to meet the regulatory requirements of a well capitalized bank 
the capital ratios for the company exceed those for the bank primarily because the million trust preferred securities offerings that the company completed in the second quarter of and in the fourth quarter of are included in the company s capital for regulatory purposes although they are accounted for as a liability in its financial statements 
the trust preferred securities are not accounted for on the bank s financial statements nor are they included in its capital 
as a result  the company has million and million more in regulatory capital than the bank at december  and  respectively  which explains most of the difference in the capital ratios for the two entities

all financial instruments are held for other than trading purposes 
cash and money market investments the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet represent their fair values 

table of contents investment securities fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments 
investments in federal home loan bank stock are recorded at cost  which also represents fair market value 
loans for variable rate loans that reprice frequently  fair values are based on carrying amounts 
an estimate of the fair value of the remaining portfolio is based on discounted cash flow analyses applied to pools of similar loans  using weighted average coupon rate  weighted average maturity  and interest rates currently being offered for similar loans 
the carrying amount of accrued interest receivable approximates its fair value 
purchased receivables fair values for purchased receivables are based on their carrying amounts due to their short duration and repricing frequency 
deposit liabilities the fair values of demand and savings deposits are equal to the carrying amount at the reporting date 
the carrying amount for variable rate time deposits approximate their fair value 
fair values for fixed rate time deposits are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies currently offered interest rates to a schedule of aggregate expected monthly maturities of time deposits 
the carrying amount of accrued interest payable approximates its fair value 
borrowings the carrying amount of short term borrowings reported in the balance sheet approximate the fair value 
fair values for fixed rate long term borrowings are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies currently offered interest rates to a schedule of aggregate expected monthly payments 
junior subordinated debentures the junior subordinated debentures have variable rates that adjust on a quarterly basis  thus their carrying amounts approximate their fair values 
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit the fair value of commitments is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements  taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties 
for fixed rate loan commitments  fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates 
the fair value of letters of credit is based on fees currently charged for similar agreements or on the estimated cost to terminate them or otherwise settle the obligation with the counterparties at the reporting date 
limitations fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time  based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument 
these estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument 
because no market exists for a significant portion of the company s financial instruments  fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience  current economic conditions  risk characteristics of various financial instruments  and other factors 
these estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision 
changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates
