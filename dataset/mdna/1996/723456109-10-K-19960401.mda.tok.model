the hollywood park casino was opened in mid under a third party leasing arrangement with pcm 
in under the california gaming registration act  it was the position of the california attorney general that as a publicly traded company  hollywood park was not eligible to register as an operator of a card club  but could lease the site to a registered operator unaffiliated with the company 
on august   sb was enacted into law

racing operations with pari mutuel wagering  patrons bet against each other in a pool rather than against the operator of the facility or with pre set odds 
at the hollywood park and turf paradise race tracks  the company operates all aspects of racing  while under kansas state racing laws sunflower is not granted any race days and does not generate any pari mutuel commissions 
the kansas racing commission granted sunflower the facility ownership and manager licenses  with all race days until the year granted to trak east  a kansas not for profit corporation 
sunflower has an agreement with trak east to provide the physical race tracks along with management and consulting services for twenty five years with options to renew for one or more successive five year terms 
the agreement and restatement of lease and management agreement was entered into as of september  hollywood park race track hollywood park conducts two live on track thoroughbred horse race meets per year 
race dates must be applied for on an annual basis from the california horse racing board the chrb 
the spring summer meet ran for weeks  for a total of race days 
the autumn meeting ran for six weeks  for a total of race days race days include three charity days per meet 
live races run wednesday through sunday  usually with nine live races a day 
the company also sends the signal of its live races off track to other locations including fairgrounds  other race tracks  hotels and casinos 
in total  the company simulcasts its live races to sites in states and three countries 
the company also accepts the simulcast signal from live races conducted at other race tracks  including the four other local southern california tracks  which has helped to mitigate the seasonality of the company s horse racing business by allowing for year round operations 
in addition  the july  passage of assembly bill ab allowed for unrestricted simulcasting between northern and southern california 
previous legislation limited such simulcasting to races with purses of at least  with the passage of ab  hollywood park s autumn meeting was the first meet with concurrent simulcasting of races from northern california  allowing patrons pari mutuel wagering opportunities approximately every minutes 
although the company has seen a shift from pari mutuel wagers placed on its live races  both on track and off track  to wagers placed on northern california simulcast races  for which the company receives a lower commission rate  the net effect of expanded simulcasting upon pari mutuel commissions has to date been positive 
with the company s limited operating experience under ab  there can be no assurance that this effect will continue to be positive 
as of march   there were numerous bills relating to horse racing and pari mutuel wagering pending in the california legislature 
the majority of these bills are spot bills at the present time and are not sufficiently detailed to allow for meaningful analysis 
the company intends during the legislative session however  to pursue and support legislation that would reduce state license fees as well as expand off track sites within california  although it is too early in the legislative session to assess the prospects of these bills 
hollywood park derives revenues from a share of the pari mutuel handle at rates fixed by the state of california  admission fees and concession sales 
the approximate pari mutuel commission rates are fixed as follows on track of wagers placed at hollywood park on its live races off track of wagers placed on live hollywood park races simulcast to california locations other than northern california off track of wagers placed on live hollywood park races simulcast to northern california off track of wagers placed on live hollywood park races simulcast out of state simulcast of wagers placed at hollywood park on races simulcast from live races conducted at other sites  except northern california simulcast of wagers placed at hollywood park on races simulcast from live races conducted in northern california simulcast of wagers placed on races simulcast from northern california  when hollywood park is conducting a live meet  and simulcasting the northern california signal to its off track sites sunflower operating as the woodlands trak east conducts live greyhound and horse racing and accepts simulcasts of both 
live greyhound racing runs from january through december  with a brief seven day period without racing from december through greyhounds generally run wednesday through monday  with evening performances every day except sunday and matinee performances on wednesday  friday  saturday and sunday 
during  trak east conducted live greyhound performances over race days 
usually there are races per performance  except for sunday when there are races 
horses ran live from august  through october   racing wednesday through sunday  for a total of race days 
trak east accepts greyhound simulcasting year round from southland greyhound park  derby land and jacksonville greyhound  wednesday through sunday 
simulcasts from various other horse race tracks are also accepted year round 
the pari mutuel commissions earned by trak east are set by the state of kansas 
the following percentages represent the final net commission retained by trak east live greyhounds and horses greyhound simulcasts horse simulcasts sunflower does not directly earn pari mutuel commissions  but instead trak east pays sunflower a lease and management fee equal to earnings  net of not less than  in and  thereafter 
amounts retained by trak east are for distribution to charities 
presently  the charity payments have been suspended pending the outcome of current kansas legislative gaming issues relating to sunflower s ability to offer slot machine gaming 
if legislation is passed which allows sunflower to operate slot machines then  as of may  the charity payments are to resume 
if such legislation is not passed  sunflower s charity agreement with trak east will be re evaluated 
if the kansas legislature does not approve other forms of gaming at sunflower including slot machines  it is probable that sunflower s assets will suffer an impairment that will require a significant asset write down that will have a materially adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial statements

the current plans call for a  seat stadium  expandable to  seats for superbowls and other special events  with approximately luxury suites  with the potential to open in september any decisions to begin construction on the stadium would be dependent upon  among other things  the execution of definitive agreements with a national football league team and the national football league  the availability of project financing with acceptable terms and the attainment of the necessary permits and certifications  for which there can be no assurance 
acting on behalf of the city of inglewood  the city of inglewood planning commission approved the development of a football stadium at hollywood park on december  two petitions for writs of mandamus were filed in los angeles county superior court against the city of inglewood to challenge the stadium approval 
the company has been named as the real party in interest in both actions 
the first  the coalition for responsible development in inglewood  et al 
v 
city of inglewood case no 
bs  contends that the stadium approval should be voided for the city of inglewood s alleged failure to comply with requirements of the california environmental quality act 
the first action is tentatively set for hearing on may  the second  which has been dismissed  nzinga owolo  et al 
v 
city of inglewood case no 
bs was filed by various petitioners in propria persona  and also contends the stadium approval should be voided for the city of inglewood s alleged failure to comply with requirements of the california environmental quality act 
while it is still early in the proceedings the company believes that there are meritorious defenses to the claims raised in the remaining lawsuit 
the environmental impact report for the hollywood park stadium was certified by the city of inglewood planning commission on december  hollywood park arena the company is in the initial stages of evaluating a proposed arena  where the los angeles lakers basketball and the los angeles kings hockey teams would play 
presently  these teams play across the street from the inglewood property 
hollywood park would supply the land for the proposed arena and receive lease payments and net parking revenues 
the proposed arena would be financed and built by the lessee 
other related retail and entertainment facilities may be included with development of either the arena or stadium 
palm springs card club the company is a partner with debartolo entertainment  in a table casino and night club to be located in palm springs  california 
hollywood park and debartolo entertainment will be landlord in a third party leasing arrangement 
the palm springs site is expected to open late fourth quarter the partnership is expected to incur costs of approximately  with the bulk of the construction costs to be the responsibility of the site s restaurateur still to be determined 
without legislation to expand the types of gaming which could be offered at the palm springs casino  the palm springs site is not expected to generate material income  due to the nearby indian reservation with full casino gaming 
other expansion on october   hollywood park finalized the purchase of approximately acres  adjacent to the inglewood property from texaco exploration and production  inc the total purchase price was approximately  with  paid on october   and the balance is due on september  on august   the company purchased approximately six acres with a hotel  adjacent to the inglewood property  for  the hotel was subsequently demolished to clear the site for the proposed stadium or other development projects 
other uses of property on october   the forum parking agreement was executed  covering the one year period from october  through september  for a minimum annual rent of  compared to  per the prior agreement  patrons attending events at the forum can park at hollywood park 
the october   forum parking agreement is for a shorter time period than the prior forum agreement  which covered twelve years  to provide flexibility regarding the proposed stadium development and other cross marketing benefits 
an oil and gas well has been located on the hollywood park property since  and had been operated under a lease between the company and the well operator  casex co 
the operator 
as of january   the company amended the oil and gas lease  such that the lessee now utilizes approximately acres of land  with a base rent of of net profits from oil and gas production  or a minimum  per annum 
the operator performed various redrilling activities throughout and as of march   was producing approximately barrels of oil per day 
the amended lease stipulates that the operator must produce a minimum of barrels of oil or gas equivalent per day for consecutive days over a consecutive day period beginning april   or operations will be terminated  and the site will be cleaned up to the company s specifications  with the operator responsible for all clean up costs 
drilling for new reserves is a highly speculative activity and there can be no assurance of finding such a reserve 
the company is subject to state and local laws and regulations  ordinances and similar provisions relating to zoning and other matters that may have the effect of restricting the uses to which the company s land and other assets may be put to use 
any additional development of the company s land  including the expansion plans described above  would require approval of such items as environmental impact reports and similar certifications 
there can be no assurance that other requisite approvals will be obtained

the attorney general may refuse to allow a change in ownership for any reason that would constitute grounds for suspension  revocation or denial of a gaming registration 
the gaming registration act also grants municipalities the right to require employees of gaming establishments to be licensed 
the city of inglewood has exercised this right 
on march   the city of inglewood adopted ordinance no 
the inglewood ordinance to establish the necessary regulatory framework to implement the card club initiative approved by inglewood voters in the inglewood ordinance provides for a single card club located at hollywood park and allows a publicly traded corporation to be the owner and operator thereof 
in order to operate the card club  the operator must be licensed by the city of inglewood and obtain a card club operations certificate 
the application for the license must include detailed information  including personal and financial data  concerning the operator of the card club  its officers  directors and certain key employees and beneficial owners of at least of such operator s voting securities 
the city of inglewood will conduct a background suitability check on all applicants for a license to own and operate the card club  and a license will be issued only upon a finding that such issuance will best protect the public health  safety  morals  good order and welfare of the residents of the city of inglewood 
the city of inglewood has complete discretion to determine the suitability of a prospective licensee and to grant the license 
on september   the inglewood city council approved hollywood park s application for a gaming license  subject to certain conditions which were met on november  on march   the city of inglewood notified hollywood park that the preliminary operations certificate authorization was extended through may  this initial city gaming license will be valid for five years unless revoked  suspended or surrendered  and is renewable annually thereafter 
the card club operating certificate is valid so long as the license is valid and no physical or procedural changes are made with respect to the card club  card club site or operations of the card club 
in addition to requiring the licensing of the card club operator  the inglewood ordinance also requires all employees of a card club to have a valid registration card from the city of inglewood 
the inglewood ordinance also provides that each i pointholder defined in the inglewood ordinance as an individual having an interest in the ownership  division of profits or revenue of a card club  whether directly  or indirectly through a partnership  joint venture  closely held corporation or as a beneficial owner of at least of the voting stock of a publicly traded corporation  and ii key management employee defined in the inglewood ordinance as every individual with the power to direct operations and employees  or with apparent or actual authority to direct the counting of the revenue  of a card club must obtain a permit from the city of inglewood

the license to operate the card club may be suspended or revoked if a pointholder or key management employee fails to obtain a permit 
without the prior consent and permission of the city of inglewood  a pointholder may not transfer or sell an interest  or allow an investment  in the ownership  division of profits or revenue of the card club to any person who is  or by reason of such transaction would become  a pointholder 
however  a purchase of capital stock by the operator of a card club would not constitute such a transfer  unless such purchase was by a pointholder

racing operations the california horse racing board has jurisdiction and supervision over all horse race meets in the state of california 
licenses granted by the chrb to conduct horse race meets are of material importance to the business of the company 
such licenses must be applied for and obtained annually by the company to conduct both the spring summer and autumn meeting race meets 
the chrb has the authority  when granting each license  to vary the number of weeks allotted and the time of the year in which such allocation falls 
the chrb may  at its discretion  refuse to issue a license to a race track operator such as hollywood park with a financial interest in another licensed race track operation or in the conduct of horse racing meets by any other person at any other race track in the state of california 
although no future assurance can be given  the company has applied for and received a license to conduct thoroughbred horse race meets every year since  except for and due to wartime activities 
as the recipient of a california racing license  hollywood park is required to pay the net proceeds of three designated charity days held during each of its live race meets up to and including the spring summer meet to a charitable distributing agent approved by the chrb 
as of the autumn meeting  the charity day payments were changed to the net proceeds from the charity days not to exceed of of the total live on track handle for the respective race meet 
for  the company was required to have a total of six charity days  and will pay approximately  to the distributing agent 
the kansas racing commission granted sunflower the facility ownership and manager licenses  with all race days until the year granted to trak east  a kansas not for profit corporation 
sunflower has an agreement with trak east to provide the physical race tracks along with management and consulting services for twenty five years with options to renew for one or more successive five year terms 
the agreement and restatement of lease and management agreement was entered into as of september  sunflower has guaranteed that the minimum net revenues to be retained by trak east  from operations of the race track facilities  will not be less than  in  and not less than  from forward 
net revenues retained by trak east are for distribution to charities 
presently  the charity payments have been suspended pending the outcome of current kansas legislative gaming issues relating to sunflower s ability to offer slot machine gaming 
if legislation is passed which allows sunflower to operate slot machines then  as of may the charity payments are to resume 
if such legislation is not passed sunflower s charity day agreement with trak east will be re evaluated 
if the kansas legislature does not approve other forms of gaming at sunflower including slot machines  it is probable that sunflower s assets will suffer an impairment that will require a significant asset write down that will have a materially adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
kansas senate concurrent resolution was introduced on february  after amendment  the final bill would have required a change to the state of kansas constitution to allow for casino gaming in kansas

the arizona racing commission issues live racing permits that are valid for three years  and off track permits are granted on a year to year basis 
in may  turf paradise received a three year live racing permit from the arizona racing commission 
the permit covers the race years of   the permit does not specify the number of race days  but does specify that live racing may be conducted between the first week of september through the third week of may 
the management of turf paradise determines the number of race days  however  for turf paradise to qualify for simulcasting on days when there is no live racing  there must be live racing at least five days a week 
competition the hollywood park casino competes for players directly with card clubs in neighboring cities  including three card clubs within approximately miles of the inglewood property  as well as card clubs located on native american reservations  where such card clubs are authorized by federal gaming regulations 
these include several reservations in san bernardino county  approximately miles from hollywood park 
the casino also faces competition from casinos in las vegas and other gaming venues 
other municipalities may  in the future  propose ballot initiatives similar to the card club initiative passed in inglewood which  if approved by voters  could lead to the establishment of additional card clubs in direct competition with hollywood park 
currently  under sb  as of january   there is a three year moratorium on public votes or referendums to approve the enactment of any city ordinance to allow additional card clubs  and prohibits the amendment of any existing ordinances 
horse racing at hollywood park competes for patrons with a wide variety of live sporting events and cultural activities 
there are numerous professional and collegiate sporting events available in southern california 
the race track also competes with las vegas casinos and other gaming venues 
the state of california sponsors a lottery  which the company believes has had a negative impact on racing revenues 
although no local race tracks operate live thoroughbred meets concurrently with hollywood park  the company believes its operations have been adversely impacted by the proliferation of additional racing opportunities both in california and outside the state 
these opportunities have made it more difficult for hollywood park to attract quality thoroughbreds  particularly during the spring and summer months when demand for such horses is greatest 
the company believes that the simulcast legislation  which since september has allowed southern california race tracks to accept pari mutuel wagers on each others simulcasts  and the july passage of ab removing all restrictions on simulcasts between northern and southern california  have had a positive impact on the company s overall revenues  primarily as the result of a significant increase in off track and simulcast racing revenues  although on track attendance and pari mutuel handle have declined 
no assurance can be given that such a decline in on track attendance and pari mutuel wagering will not continue or that the company will continue to benefit from simulcast wagering in the future 
sunflower is confronted with intense competition for patrons from riverboat gaming  complete with slot machines  on the nearby missouri river 
on june   riverboat gaming officially opened on the missouri river  with the largest boat located within miles of sunflower 
on november   missouri voters authorized the use of games of chance on riverboats  including slot machines  which were placed into play on december  the introduction of riverboat gaming in missouri has had a very significant negative impact on sunflower s financial results and is expected to continue to have such an impact 
turf paradise s primary competition is from local indian casinos with las vegas style gaming 
twenty of the twenty one tribes in arizona are either already involved in gaming or in the planning stages 
currently  there are eleven operating casinos with a combined total of approximately  slot machines  and a total of additional authorized gaming sites 
there are three functioning casinos within miles of turf paradise  with the closest approximately miles away 
the proposed salt river indian casino  near scottsdale  would be located approximately miles from turf paradise  although the proposed opening date for this casino has yet to be determined due to a decision by the governor of arizona and the state department of gaming which would not allow for the installation of slot machines and video lottery terminals at the future salt river facility 
the governor s decision also applies to any other tribal casinos which are operated by a tribe  that was not in possession of a signed gaming compact by may the salt river tribe has entered into litigation with the state of arizona regarding the governor s decision 
the outcome of this litigation is yet to be decided  and there is no certainty as to when the case will come under review 
to date  the company believes that the present level of casino gaming in arizona has been a material and significant deterrent to future growth of in state pari mutuel handle 
along with casino gaming  turf paradise also competes with a state run lottery  year round greyhound pari mutuel racing and simulcasts from prescott downs to the same off track sites turf paradise sends its live races 
presently the company is not aware of any pending legislation related to gaming on behalf of race tracks or the state lottery for the arizona legislative session 
federal income tax matters effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas accounting for income taxes  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases

the general business tax credits expire as follows   the alternative minimum tax credits do not expire 
the company s use of its tax credit carryforwards is subject to certain limitations imposed by section of the internal revenue code and by the separate return limitation year rules of the consolidated return regulations 
although management currently expects that such limitations will not prevent the company from fully utilizing the benefits of its tax credits  it is possible that such limitations could defer or reduce the company s use of its general business tax credit and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards
