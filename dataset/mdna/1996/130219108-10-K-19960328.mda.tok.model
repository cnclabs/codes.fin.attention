item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations california financial holding company the company or california financial is the holding company for its principal subsidiary  stockton savings bank stockton savings or the bank 
virtually all financial activity of the holding company is conducted through the bank 
the financial results of the company are impacted primarily by the interest rate environment and the health of the real estate market in the bank s lending territory 
although interest rates began a steady decline during  short term rates remained stubbornly high  keeping the bank s cost of funds up while asset yields increased by a lesser amount 
the end result was a narrowing of margins in and a million reduction in net interest income 
the real estate market also continued to show signs of weakness during the year  leading to further provisions on real estate investments and to a lesser degree  foreclosed properties 
the weakness in the real estate market  as well as relatively high mortgage rates for most of the year  also reduced the amount of loan refinance activity  leading to reduced origination volume and low loan sale activity 
similar to  gains recorded on the sale of loans in were minimal 
noninterest expense declined by  in as the company changed from a defined benefit pension plan to a lower costing k plan  allowing for the reversal of million in accrued pension expense 
the continued reduction in the federal funds rate in late and early by the federal reserve  the upward repricing of the bank s loans indexed to the lagging eleventh district cost of funds cofi and the decline in deposit and borrowing costs caused by the lower rate environment  bode well for improved interest rate margins over the coming year 
in addition  aggressive writedowns taken in on real estate investments as well as real estate owned  coupled with significant declines in the level of troubled assets  indicate that losses recorded on problem assets should also decline substantially in the bank expects to focus on growth in loan origination volume over the next year  primarily in its two newest market areas  fresno and sacramento counties 
the introduction of a federal housing administration fha lending program  to capture speculative construction take out business  as well as an increased focus on construction loan originations  should facilitate this growth 
construction lending is however  an inherently riskier form of business than lending on single family residences 
the balance of nonperforming assets and nonearning real estate declined significantly by year end as the level of nonperforming assets was million compared to million a year earlier 
the balance of real estate held for development purposes  which is not considered a nonperforming asset  totalled million compared to million a year earlier 
the lower balance of nonearning assets should have a positive impact on the bank s margin in results of operations the company reported earnings of million or 
per share in compared to earnings of million or 
per share in and million or per share in earnings trends over the three year period are highlighted as follows net interest income  the major component of income for the bank  has declined steadily over the past three years due primarily to the significant rise in interest rates beginning early in although rates began to drop in  the decline was gradual and occurred primarily on the long end of the yield curve  having little positive impact on the bank s short term funding costs 
loss provisions established on the loan portfolio remained at lower levels than  reflective of the decline in the level of nonperforming assets 
operating expenses decreased in relative to  largely due to the positive impact of the change in employee benefit plans 
operating expenses increased in compared to additional expenses in occurred primarily in salaries and compensation as the result of annual increases as well as to the opening of a new branch in fresno in deferred loan origination costs declined in and due to the decline in origination volume  having a negative impact on expense 
noninterest income  in the past a source of considerable revenue to the bank  was completely eliminated in and  due in large part to losses taken on real estate investments as well as to reduced income recognized on the sale of loans 
net noninterest losses of million were recorded in and  while net noninterest income totalled million in net interest income net interest income is impacted by the yield on interest earning assets  the cost of interest bearing liabilities  the amount and type of interest earning assets and the level of interest earning assets relative to interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income totalled million in  down from million in and million in table breaks out the components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for the three years ending december  the bank s average spread or the difference between the weighted average yield on interest earning assets and the weighted average cost of interest bearing liabilities  dropped to in from in and in although asset yields increased in  largely the result of increases in yields on adjustables due to increases in the index  the cost of funds increased by significantly more  reflecting the bank s sensitivity to changes in interest rates on interest bearing liabilities and the lagging impact of changes in interest rates on interest earning assets 
the relatively short maturity structure of the bank s liabilities and the large portfolio of adjustable rate mortgages that reprice on an infrequent basis  create the balance sheet disparity to interest rate changes 
in  asset yields declined much more significantly than funding costs  as the large increase in rates that occurred in began to negatively impact funding costs while asset yields had still not received any benefits from the rising rate environment

an increase in the average balance of assets outstanding of million added roughly million to interest income while a basis point increase in the average yield on interest earning assets added an additional million to interest income 
average asset growth in occurred in both the loan and investment portfolios although by year end  both asset types had declined from year end as the bank took advantage of the lower rate environment later in the year to sell some lower yielding fixed rate investments 
in addition  less loan product was added to portfolio as the decline in interest rates reduced the volume of adjustable mortgages originated 
at the same time  prepayment speeds by year end began to increase 
the increase in asset yields this year was primarily due to the upward repricing of the bank s adjustable rate loan portfolio indexed to the cofi 
the index is a composite average of the cost of funds of savings institutions in the eleventh district of the federal home loan bank 
like the bank s own cost of funds  cofi increased in as a direct result of the rise in interest rates in and the minimal change in short term rates in interest income increased by million in relative to the benefit of average interest earning asset growth of million experienced in as compared to the prior year was almost completely offset by a basis point decline in the weighted average yield between the two periods 
most of the asset growth during occurred in the balance of loans and mortgage backed securities as million in primarily mortgage backed securities and million in loans were purchased in order to take advantage of underutilized capital 
the decline in asset yields was caused by the downward repricing on the bank s cofi loan portfolio as the index declined during  despite the increase in rates that occurred during the period  again reflecting cofi s tendency to lag the general interest rate environment 
the addition of lower yielding cofi product added during the year also contributed to the decline in average loan portfolio yield 
interest expense of million was recorded in  up million from million recorded in the increase can be attributed to million in average liability growth and to a larger extent  increases in the weighted average cost of funds 
a million increase in the average balance of deposits outstanding  created mostly through the addition of million in brokered funds during the latter part of  added million to interest expense in the bank funded a portion of its asset growth in through the use of wholesale deposits 
average borrowings also increased by million during the year  adding million to interest expense 
the growth in borrowings consisted primarily of short term reverse repurchase agreements and again was used to fund asset growth 
interest expense was influenced the most in by the rapid increase in interest rates in the weighted average cost of deposits increased by basis points in relative to  adding million to interest expense during the period 
most of the decline in interest rates that occurred in was in the long end of the yield curve  having very little impact on the bank s shorter maturity deposit base 
a basis point increase in the average cost of borrowings  again the result of higher short term rates and the heavier use of short term borrowings  added  to interest expense in interest expense of million was recorded in  up million or from million reported in the entire increase can be attributed to a million increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities in compared to savings balances increased an average of million between the two periods  adding million to interest expense 
roughly million of the average savings balance increase was retail in nature  the remaining increase consisting of wholesale deposits 
wholesale funding was utilized as a cheaper funding source than borrowings to grow the institution 
average borrowings also increased by million  increasing interest expense by million 
the increase in average borrowings consisted of million in reverse repurchase agreements with terms not exceeding three months and roughly million in federal home loan bank advances 
the additional funds were utilized to fund the mortgage backed securities purchased during the year 
the average cost of deposits declined in as compared to by basis points  reducing interest expense by million 
borrowing costs declined by basis points  reducing the impact associated with the growth in borrowings by just under million 
included in interest expense is the cost of off balance sheet interest rate swaps which are designed to protect the bank s cost of funds in rising rate environments 
the cost of these hedges totalled million in  and and million in and  respectively 
swaps added basis points to the bank s overall cost of funds in and basis points in both and the impact of swaps on the bank s cost of funds is largely dependent on movements in cofi as a large percentage of the swaps are tied to this index 
if rates increase significantly  the bank receives a benefit from the swaps which serves to offset the increase in the overall cost of funds 
swap costs declined in relative to  due to both an increase in cofi as well as to a million reduction in the overall balance of swaps outstanding 
these instruments are used only to hedge asset and liability portfolios  and are not used for speculative purposes 
spread is expected to continue to widen in as the yield on the bank s large portfolio of six month adjustable rate mortgages indexed to cofi continues to widen  while the cost of funds declines in conjunction with the recent decline in short term rates 
although cofi may begin to decline  the impact on the bank s asset yields will be somewhat mitigated by the lagging effect of the index as well as the infrequent repricing of these assets 
interest rate spread does not take into consideration the impact that the relationship between the level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities has on net interest income 
net interest margin or net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets does consider the relationship and as a result is a better measure of current and future net interest income 
by comparing the difference between net margin and net spread between two periods  the impact of this additional factor on net interest income can be explained 
the bank s net margin was  and in  and  respectively 
net margin exceeded net spread by  and basis points for each of the three periods  respectively 
the improvement noted from to is indicative of a reduced level of nonperforming assets and real estate held for investment purposes  as well as the continued increase in the balance of equity outstanding 
average noninterest bearing liabilities and equity exceeded average noninterest earning assets by million  million and million at december   and  respec tively 
margin relative to spread is expected to continue to improve as the level of nonperforming assets and real estate held for development purposes declined by year end from the average for the year 
table iii highlights the improvements discussed above

noninterest income in the past  management has relied heavily on noninterest income for profitability  however  noninterest losses of million have been recorded in both and in contrast  noninterest income of million was recorded in a deteriorating real estate environment can explain most of the noninterest losses recorded over the past two years as total loss provisions  operating losses and writedowns taken on real estate were million and million in and  respectively 
the lack of gains recorded on the sale of loans due to a volatile interest rate climate and a lack of gains on the sale of real estate investments also hampered earnings 
increased emphasis on fee income generation  cost reductions and redeployment of funds currently invested in real estate development should significantly reduce the previous reliance on volatile noninterest income 
gains recognized on the sale of loans were virtually nonexistent in and although sales totalled million and million  respectively 
alternatively  loan sale gains totalled million in on sales of million  indicating a margin on sale of 
the lack of sale margins over the past two years was due to the increasing and volatile interest rate environment experienced during these periods and the corresponding increase in hedge protection taken on by the bank 
similarly  the declining rate environment in  as well as the reduced hedging activity  allowed for the improvement in sales margins during that period 
table iv provides a detailed breakdown of loan sale gains during the three year period 
table iv loan sale gains dollars in thousands years ended december net cash losses  fees recognized on sale   premium write offs net gains on sale  total gains as a percentage of sales gains recorded on the sale of real estate held for investment purposes totalled  and million in and  respectively 
no gains were recorded in due to the extensive loss provisions taken 
loss provisions of million  million and million were established in  and  respectively 
most of the loss provisions taken in each of the last three years have been on real estate the bank purchased in the late s for development purposes and not on real estate obtained through the foreclosure process 
the bank is in the process of divesting all real estate held for development purposes as the result of changes in regulation 
due to the lack of future anticipated acquisitions as well as to the relatively small balance of real estate remaining  future losses in this area should be minimal 
miscellaneous fee and servicing revenues continue to provide a stable source of income to the bank 
fee and servicing income of million  million and million was recorded in  and  respectively 
fee income increased in the current year relative to as a result of an increase in the balance of loans serviced for others as well as a significant increase in fees collected on checking accounts 
fee income was negatively impacted in both and from decreases in the level of annuity sales 
the higher rate environment tends to reduce the level of mutual funds and annuity sales as additional investment alternatives become available 
alternatively  mutual funds and annuity sales are anticipated to increase in the current lower rate environment 
regardless of the direction of interest rates  fee income is anticipated to continue to grow in the future  given the bank s current emphasis on increasing the level of fee generating transaction accounts 
noninterest expense noninterest expense totalled million in  down  or from million reported in the bank s change from a defined contribution pension plan to a less expensive k plan permitted the reduction of million in benefit expense in the million benefit achieved through the change in plan was somewhat mitigated by a  decline in deferred loan origination expense as a result of the decline in loan origination volume 
the bank s earnings are negatively impacted when loan volume declines as all loan officers are on salary rather than commissioned and in house appraisers are utilized to perform most appraisals 
occupancy and data processing expense also increased in the current year as a new branch and loan facility were built and a branch added last year was fully occupied in the current year 
additional occupancy costs incurred in the current year were somewhat offset by a branch consolidation during the year 
noninterest expenses in totalled million  up from million recorded in a reduction in deferred costs of origination of  due to reduced loan volume and higher occupancy costs due to the move to a new corporate headquarters were reflected in expenses 
income tax provision the company recorded income tax provisions of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate was  and in  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate decreased in relative to due primarily to a  one time tax benefit taken as a result of a settlement with the irs regarding the tax treatment for amortization of core deposit intangibles 
liquidity the bank derives its liquidity primarily from the payment  payoff or sale of loans  the acquisition of new deposits  both retail and wholesale  federal home loan bank advances and borrowings securitized by investments 
total assets of the company remained fairly flat during the year  decreasing by million or slightly over 
although total asset balances changed very little  asset composition did change somewhat as the bank sought to reduce its susceptibility to rising interest rates by selling fixed rate mortgage backed securities 
these assets were replaced by floating rate current index collateralized mortgage obligations which respond more rapidly to changes in the interest rate environment 
the bank s collateralized mortgage obligations carry little credit risk as they are all agency backed or aaa rated with the exception of a million a rated security purchased in december  and are therefore not subject to permanent impairment 
floating rate securities are  however  subject to market value volatility  particularly in rising interest rate environments when the level of rates approaches the life time caps on these instruments 
the decline in loan origination volume to million from million also reduced the balance of mortgages added to the portfolio 
principal payments on mortgages completely offset the amount of new loans originated for portfolio  providing no ability to grow assets through originations 
loan purchase activity was minimal in the current year  providing for no additional asset growth 
the bank reclassified its entire investment portfolio as available for sale in august so that it would have the flexibility to sell any of its investments in an effort to reduce the interest sensitivity in its balance sheet 
at the time of reclassification  the bank s portfolio of investments previously designated as held to maturity was adjusted to market value and reclassified as available for sale 
the market value adjustment also impacted net worth 
as a result of the reclassification  the bank will be unable to classify any investment purchases over a one year period following the date of reclassification as held to maturity 
net worth in future periods will therefore be subject to some level of volatility due to the required classification of all current investments and any investments purchased over the following year as available for sale 
sales of investments totalled million in compared to investment sales of million in no sales occurred in the majority of sales in consisted of long term fixed rate mortgage backed securities 
total liability balances also changed very little although deposits and reverse repurchase agreements declined by million and million  respectively in  and were replaced by federal home loan bank advances 
brokered deposits totalled million as of december  compared to million outstanding as of year end the million decline in brokered certificates was partially offset by a million increase in retail deposits 
the decline in short term reverse repurchase agreements was replaced by like term federal home loan bank advances 
asset liability management the level of net interest income  the primary source of revenue to the bank  is largely dependent on the level of interest rates and how key rates interact in that environment 
the repricing and maturity structures of both assets and liabilities also impact the volatility in net interest income 
historically  the bank s level of net interest income has been negatively impacted in rising rate environments as most of its assets adjust to an index that lags the general interest rate environment while most of its liabilities tend to reprice on a much more frequent basis  responding more quickly to changes in rates 
the significant increase in rates experienced in reduced margins in the latter half of that year and into as the yields on assets increased slowly while the cost of deposits and borrowings increased much more quickly 
alternatively  the decline in rates in has started to reduce the bank s cost of funds while asset yields are continuing to increase  leading to wider margins 
the bank undertook some balance sheet restructuring in in an effort to reduce its susceptibility to rising rates 
more specifically the level of long term fixed rate mortgages and mortgage backed securities was reduced by million as a result of sale and prepayment activity 
permanent adjustable rate mortgages and mortgage backed securities increased by million as all million of adjustable mortgages originated during were retained in the portfolio 
current index floating rate securities of million were added to the investment portfolio 
further restructuring is expected in as the emphasis will continue to be placed on the origination and retention of current index adjustable mortgages and one month cofi product 
in addition  the bank expects to take advantage of the current low rate environment to increase the level of long term fixed rate borrowings with the federal home loan bank to replace short term borrowings 
loan origination volume and mortgage banking activity the amount and type of loans originated are largely dependent on the interest rate environment as well as the overall health of the bank s real estate lending market 
a continued weak real estate market as well as a rate environment  although falling  that was still higher than the market of  led to a significantly lower level of loan origination volume in originations totalled million in  million in and million in refinance activity represented of total loan volume in  down from and in and  respectively 
all types of loans originated declined during the year relative to however  adjustable rate mortgage loan originations declined the most from the previous year  a reflection of the current declining rate environment 
table v provides a breakout of loan volume by type of loan for the three years 
the volume of fixed rate loan originations was highest in when refinance activity was still high and cofi was lagging the general interest rate decline 
the rate differential between cofi and current fixed rates was not wide enough to attract borrowers away from the certainty of a fixed rate mortgage compared to the uncertainty of an adjustable 
table v lending volume dollars in thousands years ended december short term construction    long term fixed rate    long term adjustable rate    other    total originations    loan origination volume is expected to increase in due to the low current rate environment  leading to increased refinancing activity and the offering of fha loans  which represent roughly of total loans originated in the bank s current market area 
the bank has traditionally sold a majority of fixed rate mortgages originated in an effort to reduce its balance sheet susceptibility to rising interest rates 
the level of interest rates tends to have a major impact on the type of loan originated and thus  on the level of mortgage banking activities undertaken 
in periods of falling interest rates  the rate differential between a fixed and adjustable rate mortgage is usually not significant enough to draw a consumer to the uncertainty of an adjustable rate mortgage so the level of fixed rate mortgage originations increases 
volume is further impacted by increased refinance activity in low rate environments 
the reverse holds true in a rising rate environment and the consumer tends to move to adjustable rate mortgages 
at the same time  total originations decline due to a reduction in refinance activity 
this phenomenon creates a large amount of volatility in mortgage loan sale activity for the bank  depending on the level of rates 
loan sale volume totalled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in and  both relatively low rate environments  sales represented and of total origination volume  respectively 
alternatively  in the higher rate environment of  sales volume only represented of total originations  reflecting the increase in volume of adjustable rate originations 
consistent with the volatility in sales over the past three years  gains recognized on loans sales also fluctuated significantly 
gains of   and million were recognized in  and  respectively 
in addition to the volume of loan sales  loan sale gains are also impacted by the direction and degree of change in interest rates 
in  with interest rates heading down  the bank s gain on loan sales as a percentage of sales totalled basis points 
in  with rates increasing rather rapidly  loan sale margins were only basis points 
in  a declining rate environment  margins averaged basis points 
the significant difference in margins between and  both periods of declining rates  was the result of increased hedging activity in the current year 
the bank has made it a practice to retain servicing on all loans sold in order to insure good customer service  generate consistent servicing revenues and provide an opportunity to cross sell the servicing customer other bank products 
servicing income totalled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the bank s portfolio of loans serviced for others totalled million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
effective january   the bank will implement sfas accounting for mortgage servicing rights 
fas requires that the rights to servicing mortgage loans for others be recognized as a separate asset  however those servicing assets are acquired 
additionally  the recognized mortgage servicing asset must be regularly evaluated for impairment 
the impact of adoption of this standard will be to increase the level of loan sale gains recognized as a percentage of loans sold 
based on currently available information  management estimates loan sale gain margins will increase by roughly basis points 
in addition  future servicing income should decline  a trade off for recognition at the time of sale of the servicing asset 
income volatility may also increase due to the potential impairment and corresponding writedown of the servicing asset 
asset quality the bank s level of nonperforming assets  which consists of nonaccruing loans  restructured troubled debt and real estate owned through foreclosure  declined significantly over the past year 
table vi breaks out nonperforming assets by type for the five periods indicated 
nonperformers totalled million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
table vi summary of nonperforming assets dollars in thousands at december non accrual loans family residential mortgages      commercial real estate mortgages    construction and land     troubled debt restructured family residential mortgages   commercial real estate mortgages    construction and land      gross nonperforming loans      real estate owned family residential property    commercial real estate property      construction and land      gross real estate owned      gross nonperforming assets      loan losses reserves      real estate owned loss reserves    loan loss reserves gross nonperforming loans generally  loans are considered nonaccruing once they become days or more delinquent or have been classified as impaired 
the nonaccrual of a loan is generally the first sign that a loan is in trouble 
in many circumstances  once a loan becomes delinquent to this extent  it is either restructured or goes into foreclosure 
deferred interest income on delinquent loans totalled   and million at december   and  respectively 
restructured debt is usually considered troubled when the terms or conditions of the restructure are more advantageous to the borrower than what would normally be offered 
it is generally the bank s position when restructuring debt that it is in the bank s best interest to allow the borrower to continue the financing under revised terms rather than to take the property back through the foreclosure process 
the level of troubled restructured debt decreased to million at december  from million at the end of and million at the end of three large acquisition and development loans totalling million comprised most of the troubled debt outstanding as of year end 
all three loans were made to facilitate the sale of real estate development in due to regulatory divestiture requirements 
most of the debt was restructured by lowering the interest rate or advancing funds for taxes  insurance or interest 
interest income on troubled debt is normally deferred by the bank and recognized on a cash basis only 
the amount of interest deferred by the bank on troubled debt totalled million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
of the balance of troubled debt outstanding  million  million and million was more than days delinquent at year end  and  respectively 
the delinquent debt at year end included the land loans on two of the three large debt restructurings discussed above 
the level of provisions established on loans has declined significantly as compared to  an indication of declining troubled loans and management s opinion that stockton s loan portfolio is improving 
loan loss provisions totalled million in   in and million in the bank s level of real estate owned  totalled million at the end of  compared to million and million at the end of and  respectively 
real estate outstanding as of year end consisted of single family residences  two office buildings and land in four different subdivisions 
loss reserves on real estate of million at the end of had not been allocated to specific assets but were outstanding to cover uncertainties in the valuation of several properties 
the unallocated reserves for real estate owned were fully allocated in in connection with foreclosures during the year  the bank s loan charge offs totalled million  compared to charge offs taken of million and million in and  respectively 
subsequent to foreclosure  valuation concerns resulted in loss provisions that were established on real estate owned totalling million for  million in and million in charge offs taken on the sale of real estate owned totalled  in   in and  in the sale of an apartment building was the single largest charge off in on real estate taken back 
loan charge offs in related primarily to the foreclosure of a speculative construction subdivision in the galt area  a city just south of sacramento  california 
a portion of this subdivision was taken back in  when significant charge offs also occurred 
a majority of the reserves established on real estate owned in also related to the portion of the galt subdivision taken back in real estate values in the galt area have fallen tremendously over the past year  necessitating the additional reserves 
land values have declined due to very high fees charged by the city of galt and by liquidation sales by developers 
further declines in land value in that market should have little impact on the bank as the remaining book value of this land at december  was  the remaining loss reserves established on real estate owned in related to property owned in downtown stockton 
the bank uses an asset classification process to identify troubled loans in its portfolio 
paying capacity of the borrower as well as the adequacy of collateral value are evaluated 
assets identified through this process as possessing some weakness are classified by the bank and are monitored on an ongoing basis 
by definition  all nonperforming assets are immediately classified 
the level and type of nonperforming and classified assets  historical experience  current economic conditions and trends  as well as the lending mix are all reviewed when determining the level and adequacy of loan loss reserves 
the balance of classified assets totalled million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
alternatively  loan loss reserves totalled million  million  and million at year end   and  respectively 
the slight increase in loan loss reserves in can be primarily attributed to the decline in nonperforming loans and reduced level of charge offs taken in the current year 
the decline in loan loss reserves in relative to  despite the increase in the overall loan portfolio and level of charge offs  is the result of a decline in the balance of total nonperforming loans in the fourth quarter of  as well as a decline in the overall balance of higher risk construction and land loans 
the reduction in nonperforming loans also occurred in higher risk loans 
the higher than normal level of charge offs taken in was isolated to one large block of land 
real estate investments the bank has  for many years  invested in real estate for development purposes through a wholly owned subsidiary  stockton service corporation  stockton service 
stockton service would generally acquire land and then contract with a developer to build out and manage the project in exchange for a share in profits after stockton service received a preferential return equivalent to interest and fees earned on a construction loan 
all profits earned in excess of the preferential return are then split between the two parties in an agreed upon manner 
all projects currently outstanding involve the build out of single family subdivisions 
all income  including the preferential return  is reported as gain on the sale of real estate in the bank s financial statement 
gains were nonexistent in and totalled  and million for and  respectively  and are shown in more detail at table vii 
loss provisions of million and million were recorded in and  respectively 
no reserves were recorded in loss reserves on real estate investments totalled million at year end  million at december  and million at year end the significant amount of losses taken on the bank s real estate development activities over the past several years is due to the significant amount of purchases that occurred in  a period when real estate values were at their peak  and the decline in values that has occurred subsequently 
the decision by the bank in to accelerate the disposition of real estate through bulk sales also increased the level of reserves necessary 
table vii sales and profits on real estate held for development dollars in thousands years ended december gross sales of real estate    profits consisting of preferential returns  additional losses gains total losses gains before capitalized interest  capitalized interest relieved  net losses profits  profit margins 
the level of reserves on real estate development outstanding at december  was based on bonafide bulk sales anticipated in as well as the anticipated sales of remaining homes 
conservative absorption and pricing estimates were used in the valuation of homes 
as a result  the current level of reserves should be adequate and no material additional provisions are anticipated 
the enactment of firrea in required the divestiture of all real estate held for development purposes by financial institutions in excess of of assets 
consequently  no new projects have been taken on by stockton service since then 
the balance of real estate currently outstanding represents the remaining build out of older projects which stockton service is attempting to divest itself of as expeditiously as possible 
as a result  the balance of real estate outstanding has steadily declined over the past several years  from million at the end of to million at the end of even though the balance currently outstanding is less than the of the permissible limit of million  the full balance of this investment must be deducted from regulatory capital  subject to a phase out schedule 
further discussion of the impact of this investment on regulatory capital can be found under the capital resources and regulatory compliance section of this discussion 
capital resources and regulatory compliance the company s capital position increased by million or roughly from the previous year 
income recorded of million and a positive mark to market of the bank s investment portfolio designated as available for sale of million were partially offset by dividends paid of million 
the investment portfolio increased in value in the current year due to the decreasing interest rate environment 
dividends paid during the year of 
per share represented of total income earned in total capital increased by million or roughly in compared to earnings of million were partially offset by dividends paid of million and a negative mark to market adjustment on the bank s investment portfolio classified as available for sale totalling million 
the increasing rate environment during that period was responsible for the negative adjustment 
during  dividends represented of total net income 
a stock dividend was affected in december of all per share calculations within this report have been adjusted to reflect the dividend and assure comparability 
the bank is under the regulatory guidance of both the office of thrift supervision ots and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
three minimum capital requirements were mandated by firrea  requiring that financial institutions must maintain minimum risk based capital of at least of risk weighted assets  core capital of at least of adjusted total assets and tangible capital of at least of adjusted total assets 
under firrea s risk based capital guidelines  the bank is required to maintain higher levels of capital against assets deemed to involve higher degrees of credit risk 
in addition  the bank must deduct from regulatory capital  subject to a phase in schedule  its investments and loans to subsidiaries engaged in nonpermissable activities such as real estate development 
the bank s capital ratios and net requirements as of december  are detailed on table viii 
at december   the bank exceeded all minimum regulatory capital requirements mandated by firrea with risk based  core tangible capital of and  respectively 
at december   the bank s fully phased in risk based  core tangible capital ratios were and  respectively 
the decrease in capital ratios on a fully phased in basis is due to the deduction from capital due to investments in subsidiaries involved in impermissible activities 
according to the phase in schedule mandated by firrea  the bank is currently only required to deduct of its investments in stockton service from capital 
this percentage increases to on july  table viii capital requirements unaudited dollars in thousands at december current capital risk based capital   excess over minimum   core capital   excess over minimum   tangible capital   excess over minimum   fully phased in capital risk based capital   core capital   tangible capital   the federal deposit insurance corporation act of fdicia provided for increased funding for fdic deposit insurance and for expanded regulation of the banking industry 
among other things  fdicia requires that the federal banking regulators take prompt corrective action with respect to institutions failing to meet minimum capital standards 
specific categories defined in the act include well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
various restrictions are to be applied on institutions characterized as undercapitalized 
to be considered well capitalized  an institution must generally have a leverage ratio of at least  a tier one  risk based capital ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
the bank was in the well capitalized category as of december   even on a fully phased in basis with the deduction from capital for investments in subsidiaries involved in impermissible activities 
as the bank meets its fully phased in capital requirements  it is allowed to make capital distributions primarily dividends to the company upon days notice to the ots  up to an amount that would reduce its surplus capital ratio by one half of the surplus outstanding at the beginning of the year  plus all of its income for the year  as long as it still meets its fully phased in capital requirements after the proposed capital distribution 
the ots adopted a final rule in august of for calculating an interest rate risk component for risk based capital 
under the rule  the component will be an addition to the existing minimum risk based capital requirement 
implementation has been delayed for an indefinite period 
the rule provides that the ots will calculate the interest rate risk component on a quarterly basis for the bank 
the rule provides that if an institution s market value of portfolio equity or the relationship of its market value of interest earning assets to the market value of interest bearing liabilities declines by more than of the market value of interest earning assets with a basis point shift in interest rates  then an institution must maintain additional capital equivalent to one half the measured difference between its current market value of portfolio equity and the calculated decline in value with the interest rate shift 
based on current interest rate risk calculations provided by ots to the bank  there would have been no interest rate risk component for the bank at december  therefore  even if the interest rate risk component were in effect at year end  it would have no impact on the bank s regulatory capital designation as well capitalized 
regulatory capital increased in compared to the prior year 
the reduced level of investment in subsidiaries with impermissible activities and lower balance of core deposit premium  which are both deducted from regulatory capital  are responsible for the improvement in capital position 
the adjustment to capital for marking to market the investment portfolio is not includable in the calculation of regulatory capital and thus has no impact on the bank s capital position 
the treasury department  the office of thrift supervision and the federal deposit insurance corporation have recommended to congress that institutions with saif assessable deposits pay a special assessment in an amount sufficient to recapitalize the fund 
the issue is currently included in the budget reconciliation bill  waiting to be approved by congress 
once approved  it is estimated that saif insured institutions such as the bank will be charged a one time assessment of approximately basis points on all deposits outstanding as of march  this assessment would approximate million for the bank  assuming the foregoing assessment rate and date 
under a separate bill  the assessment would be fully deductible for income tax purposes 
if the above described legislation is enacted  it is anticipated to have an estimated million negative impact on the bank s earnings in the year of enactment 
going forward  however  the level of saif premiums paid is expected to drop significantly 
if the assessment was paid as of year end  the bank would have still been well capitalized by regulatory definition 
recent accounting developments in march  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement applies to financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  it requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
additionally  this statement requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell
