the transaction was accounted for as a pooling  but without restatement of prior period financial information  due to lack of materiality

through the acquisition  the corporation increased the deposit base of an existing affiliate substantially while increasing its operating costs only marginally 
through the merger transaction  the corporation was able to move the bank charter of the merged institution to adjacent laurel county and now has a branch in london  kentucky  which is among the fastest growing areas in kentucky 
results of operations compared to net income for was million compared to million for earnings per share for was per share fully diluted compared to per share fully diluted for all information has been restated due to the acquisition of woodford bancorp  inc  on may   which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
net interest income for increased as compared to  rising from million in to million in noninterest income and noninterest expenses increased by lesser amounts  with noninterest income increasing from million in to million in  and noninterest expense increasing from million in to million in net income for was reduced by pre tax losses of million associated with certain mortgage backed derivative securities purchased from customer trust accounts during the year and million of restructuring and reengineering costs 
provision for loan losses was slightly higher in than in  due mainly to unusual loan losses of million recognized on two loans in the second quarter of return on average assets increased from in to in and return on average equity increased from in to in net interest income net interest income increased from to and was a major contributing factor to the corporation s increase in net income 
net interest income increased from million in to million in the increase was mainly due to the increase in average earning assets and the rising interest rates on assets and deposits that were in effect in the corporation s average earning assets increased from billion in to billion in average interest bearing liabilities also increased during the period  from billion in to billion in average interest bearing liabilities as a percentage of average earning assets remained fairly stable  going from in to in the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities both increased during as compared to the taxable equivalent yield on average interest earning assets increased from in to in the cost of average interest bearing liabilities increased from to during the same period 
despite the fact that the cost of interest bearing liabilities rose more than the yield on interest earning assets and the net interest spread declined from in to in  the net interest margin increased slightly from in to in this was due to the rise in interest rates 
if interest rates rise by approximately the same amount for both assets and liabilities  all other things being equal  the net interest income and resulting net interest margin will both increase  because interest earning assets have larger balances 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses decreased from million in to million in average loans were significantly higher in increasing from million in to billion in the major factor in the decrease in provision was the charge off of two loans in the second quarter of totaling million 
one charge off of million was for industrial computer software development and was the only loan of its type in the corporation s portfolio 
the other loan at thousand was coal industry related 
charge offs net of recoveries as a percentage of average loans outstanding declined from in to in as charge offs were lower in and average loans increased 
the allowance for loan losses increased significantly  rising from million at december  to million at december  the acquisitions of community bank  middlesboro and williamsburg accounted for million of the increase in the loan loss reserve 
problem loans are reviewed on a monthly basis and specific allocations are made based on review of collateral and payment ability of the borrower 
loans are fully reserved when review determines that there is an inability to pay and the liquidation value of collateral is insufficient 
loans days or more past due are ordinarily placed on non accrual 
on january   the corporation adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
loans are categorized as impaired when it is probable that full collection of principal and interest will not be received  except for groups of smaller homogeneous loans  such as consumer and residential mortgage loans 
the statement also requires specific reserves for loans considered to be impaired 
the adoption of the statement was not material to the corporation s provision for loan losses or financial condition and results of operations 
the corporation has an internal loan review department which is responsible for reviewing the loan portfolios of all subsidiary banks 
any loans classified as loss  doubtful  substandard or special mention that are not included in non performing loans do not represent or result from trends or uncertainties which management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity or capital resources  or represent material credits about which management is aware of any information which would cause management to have serious doubt as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms 
the corporation does not believe there are currently any trends  events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the volume of its non performing loans 
noninterest income noninterest income increased from million in to million in service charges on deposit accounts is the largest component of noninterest income and increased from million in to million in as the deposit base of the corporation continued to expand 
noninterest bearing deposits increased from million as of december  to million at december  trust income declined from million in to million in as the trust assets managed declined during the year 
other noninterest income increased from million in to million in the largest component of other noninterest income was insurance commissions  which increased from million in to million in this was due to new lending programs which increased the company s loan portfolio during the year 
loans accounted for of total assets at december  compared to of total assets at december  net gains from the sale of residential mortgage loans decreased from  in to  in as the level of loans originated and sold declined 
this is normal in a time of rising interest rates 
gains on the sale of loans are most likely to be higher in times of level or falling interest rates 
securities gains and losses were not a factor in the increase as the corporation incurred net securities losses of  in and net securities gains of  in noninterest expense noninterest expense increased from million in to million in except for two unusual items which decreased significantly  all individual categories increased as would be expected in a period of expansion through acquisitions 
the increases in assets  employees and operational facilities all contributed to across the board increases in noninterest expenses 
salaries and employee benefits increased from million in to million in as the number of full time equivalent employees increased due to acquisitions of new banks and opening of new branches 
occupancy expense also increased  rising from million in to million in  also due to increased costs of acquisitions and new branches 
also increasing during the period were equipment costs  from million in to million in  data processing  from million in to million in  stationery printing costs  from million in to million in  other taxes  which mainly consists of kentucky bank shares tax  from million in to million in and other noninterest expense  which increased from million in to million in the two items which decreased significantly were losses associated with mortgage backed derivative securities and restructuring and reengineering costs 
mortgage backed derivatives had been purchased for certain trust accounts administered by the corporation s affiliates 
while these securities are guaranteed by either the federal home loan mortgage corporation or the federal national mortgage association and therefore  pose very little  if any  credit risk  they exhibited an excessive volatility which led to a significant decline in their market value in the corporation recognized a million pre tax loss in these securities in which represented the difference between the book value carried in the customer accounts and the actual market value 
the corporation purchased the securities from the trust accounts during and because management believes there is no credit loss  expects to collect the full face value over time 
the securities are carried at market value as available for sale and currently no default on payments or additional market value declines have been suffered to date 
during the latter part of and continuing through  the corporation intensively examined ways to improve its performance through restructuring its operations and reengineering its work flow processes 
as a result of this examination  the corporation adopted a plan which downsized its workforce by approximately of total employment 
severance and other related costs of downsizing in the amount of million were recognized in compared to net income for was million compared to million for primary earnings per share for was per share compared to for fully diluted earnings per share was per share for compared to for as noted in the to comparison  earnings for were negatively impacted by losses of million associated with mortgage backed derivative securities purchased from customer trust accounts during the year and by million of restructuring and reengineering costs 
provision for loan losses was higher in than in  due mainly to unusual loan losses of million in the second quarter of  also noted in the to comparison 
net interest income rose slightly from million in to million in the increase in net interest income was due to a higher level of average earning assets 
yield on earning assets and cost of interest bearing funds both declined  but yields on interest earning assets declined by more  causing the net interest margin to decline for as compared to noninterest income declined from million in to million in this was due to the decline of net securities and loan sales gains from to in  securities gains totaled million and gains on sale of loans totaled million while in the company suffered net securities losses of thousand and loan gains of thousand 
exclusive of these two items  noninterest income increased from million in to million in noninterest expense increased from million in to million in the largest reason for the increase was the million of losses associated with mortgage backed derivatives in and also contributing were million of restructuring and reengineering costs 
data processing costs increased from million in to million in primarily as a result of the conversion of the corporation s affiliates to a new data processing system which began in and was completed in other noninterest expense increased from million in to million in which was due primarily to increased legal and professional fees associated with upcoming merger activity and consulting fees related to the reengineering 
liquidity the corporation s objectives are to ensure that funds are available at the subsidiary banks to meet deposit withdrawals and credit demands without unduly penalizing profitability  and to ensure that funding is available for the parent company to meet the ongoing cash needs while maximizing profitability 
the corporation continues to identify ways to provide for liquidity on both a current and long term basis 
on a long term basis  the subsidiary banks rely mainly on core deposits  certificates of deposit of  or more  repayment of principal and interest on loans and securities  as well as federal funds sold and purchased 
the subsidiary banks also rely on the sale of securities under repurchase agreements  securities available for sale and federal home loan bank borrowings 
deposits increased from billion at december  to billion at december  approximately million of the increase was from the acquisition of community bank  million was from the acquisition of middlesboro and million was from the acquisition of williamsburg 
this growth has allowed the company to remain liquid in a time of increasing loan demand requiring more funding than has been needed in recent years 
due to the nature of the markets served by the subsidiary banks  management believes that the majority of its certificates of deposit of  or more are no more volatile than its core deposits 
during the recent period of low interest rates  these deposit balances remained stable as a percentage of total deposits 
in addition arrangements have been made with two correspondent banks for the purchase of federal funds on an unsecured basis  up to an aggregate of million  if necessary  to meet the corporation s liquidity needs 
the corporation owns million of securities designated as available for sale and valued at market which are available to meet liquidity needs on a continuing basis 
in the fourth quarter of  the financial accounting standards board interpreted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investment in debt and equity securities  to allow a one time movement of securities from held to maturity to available for sale 
the corporation moved million of these securities to available for sale during the fourth quarter of in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s statement 
the corporation also relies on federal home loan bank advances for both liquidity and management of its asset liability position 
often the corporation matches the maturity of these advances with pools of residential mortgage loans which are not sold in the secondary market  some of which have maturities of ten to fifteen years 
federal home loan bank advances decreased from million at december  to million at december  the corporation generally relies upon net inflows of cash from financing activities  supplemented by net inflows of cash from operating activities  to provide cash for its investing activities 
as is typical of many financial institutions  significant financing activities include deposit gathering  use of short term borrowing facilities such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements  and the issuance of long term debt 
the corporation borrowed million in june to finance the acquisition of middlesboro  of which million was repaid during the second half of this debt is under a million credit line expiring june   which is in the form of a revolving line of credit see long term debt footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
the corporation s primary investing activities include purchases of investment securities and loan originations 
in conjunction with maintaining a satisfactory level of liquidity  management monitors the degree of interest rate risk assumed on the balance sheet 
the corporation monitors its interest rate risk by the use of static and dynamic gap models at the one year interval 
the static gap model monitors the difference in interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities as a percentage of total assets that mature within the specified time frame 
the dynamic gap model goes further in that it assumes that interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be reinvested 
the corporation uses the sendero system to monitor its interest rate risk 
the corporation desires an interest sensitivity gap of not more than fifteen percent of total assets at the one year interval 
the corporation s static interest rate gap position as of december  is presented below interest rate sensitivity analysis december  total over in thousands months months year year total interest earning assets federal funds sold    securities and deposits      loans      total earning assets      interest bearing liabilities now  money market and savings accounts     time deposits      federal funds purchased and other short term borrowings    advances from fhlb      long term debt      total interest bearing liabilities      interest sensitivity gap for the period      cumulative      cumulative as a percent of earning assets the corporation now uses on a limited basis interest rate swaps as an additional tool in managing interest rate risk 
as of december   there was outstanding million in notional principal value of interest rate swaps 
interest rate swaps involve an exchange of cash flows based on the notional principal amount and agreed upon fixed and variable interest rates 
in this transaction  the corporation has agreed to pay a floating interest rate based on libor and receive a fixed interest rate in return 
the impact on operations of interest rate swaps was not significant during and is not expected to be significant during capital resources total shareholders equity increased from million at december  to million at december  the acquisitions of community bank and williamsburg added million to shareholders equity during the primary source of capital of the corporation is retained earnings 
cash dividends per share were per share for and per share for the corporation retained of its earnings for and for under guidelines issued by banking regulators  the corporation and its subsidiary banks are required to maintain a minimum tier i risk based capital ratio of and a minimum total risk based ratio of 
risk based capital ratios weight the relative risk factors of all assets and also consider the risk associated with off balance sheet items 
the corporation must also maintain a minimum tier i leverage ratio of 
the following table provides the capital ratios for the corporation as of december  and shareholders common equity for tier i capital is adjusted for unrealized losses on debt securities only 
capital data december in thousands corporate capital components tier i capital shareholders common equity net of tax effected afs debt securities unrealized gain of and unrealized loss of  respectively   less goodwill   total tier i capital   tier ii capital allowable allowance for loan losses   total capital   risk adjusted assets   capital ratios tier i risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio tier i leverage ratio average equity to average assets dividends declared per share return on average assets return on average common equity the guidelines which require bank holding companies  commercial banks  and savings banks to maintain certain minimum ratios define companies as well capitalized that sufficiently exceed the minimum ratios 
the banking regulators may alter minimum capital requirements as a result of revising their internal policies and their ratings of individual institutions 
pikeville national corporation and all banking affiliates met the criteria for well capitalized at december  as of december   management is not aware of any current recommendations by banking regulatory authorities which  if they were to be implemented  would have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material adverse impact on the corporation s liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
the corporation s principal source of funds used to pay dividends to shareholders and service long term debt is the dividends it receives from subsidiary banks 
various federal and state statutory provisions  as well as regulatory policies and directives  limit the amount of dividends that subsidiary banks can pay without prior regulatory approval 
these restrictions have had no major impact on the corporation s dividend policy or its ability to service long term debt  nor is it anticipated that they will have any major impact in the foreseeable future 
impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of the corporation s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
therefore  the corporation differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in nonmonetary assets  such as fixed assets and inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of assets in the banking industry and on the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also affects other expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
management believes the most significant impact on financial and operating results is the corporation s ability to react to changes in interest rates 
management seeks to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against the effects of wide interest rate fluctuations
