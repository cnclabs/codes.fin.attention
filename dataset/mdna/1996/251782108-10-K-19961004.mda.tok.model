the term loan requires monthly principal payments of that began november  borrowings under this facility were used to repay the then existing senior debt facility  to finance the national acme acquisition see note of notes to the company financial statements and to provide for working capital requirements 
on april   the company obtained a new term loan in the amount of  to assist in the financing of the litigation costs see item legal proceedings and increased the senior credit facility to  the new term loan requires monthly principal payments of that began june  the term loans require payments through september   with final payments totalling  due on october  the new senior debt facility aggregating approximately  at july   is comprised of  in term loans and a revolving credit agreement which provides for borrowings up to  interest on the term loans is payable monthly at above prime rate or  at the company s option  at alternative rates based on libor

outlook the following discussion includes certain forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those reflected by the forward looking statements contained in this document and a number of factors may affect future results  liquidity and capital resources 
these factors include the fact that the company derives a substantial portion of its sales from cyclical industries  including the automotive  aerospace and housing industries  the ability to introduce new products in a timely fashion  the pace of technological changes effecting the products manufactured and services provided by the company  the company s substantial debt service requirements  much of which is based on variable rates  the dependence of the company s growth on acquisitions and the company s ability to finance such acquisitions and to profitably integrate the acquired operations  the level of margins achievable in the markets served by the company  and the ability to continue to minimize operating expenses 
although the company believes it has the business strategy and resources needed for improved operations  future sales and margin trends cannot be reliably predicted 
during the past two fiscal years  the company has recorded pre tax charges of  to accrue for or settle three separate lawsuits which preceded or resulted from the initial public offering in march at this time  the company is not a party to any legal proceeding the outcome of which  in management s opinion  would have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the company actively seeks to expand by acquisition  as well as through the growth of its present businesses 
a significant acquisition would require additional borrowings 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms 
impact of inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on the company s net sales or net income during the last three fiscal years 
borrowings under the senior credit facility bear interest at short term rates 
increases in the prevailing rate of inflation could be accompanied by increases in short term interest rates  which could have an adverse impact on the company s net income and cash flow
